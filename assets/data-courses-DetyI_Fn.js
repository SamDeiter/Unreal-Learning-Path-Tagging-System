This mostly affects methods lit using traditional shadow mapping, but it's important to consider for any dynamic light to reduce frame cost.","Setting a **Max Draw Distance** on a light will limit its dynamic shadowing contribution up to that point. For scenes where you have a lot of small to medium-sized lights affecting an area, this can help reduce frame cost. Using **Max Fade Range** in addition to the max draw distance will fade that light out over time so that it doesn't abruptly appear and disappear.","The Shadow Map shadowing method is a product of balancing quality with performance.

We can then expand the **Bindings** category that appears on the right, and add one **Action Mapping** and two **Axis Mappings**.","Now that our input is configured, let's set up a MyPawn in our level. The **MyPawn** class will appear in our **Content Browser**, and is ready to be dragged into the **Level Editor**.","One more step is needed to set up our MyPawn. We'll need to give it a **Static Mesh** so that we can see it in the game. We can do this by selecting the MyPawn we just created, selecting the component called **OurVisibleComponent (Inherited)** in the **Details Panel**, and assigning an asset to it through the dropdown box in the **Static Mesh** category. For this tutorial, **Shape_Cylinder** is a good asset to use."],seeAlso:[{label:"%making-interactive-experiences/Input:title%",docKey:"input"},{label:"%programming-and-scripting/programming-language-implementation/cpp-in-unreal-engine/tutorials:title%",docKey:"tutorials"}],readTimeMinutes:1,sourcePath:"programming-and-scripting/programming-language-implementation/cpp-in-unreal-engine/tutorials/PlayerInput",track:["Architecture/Engineering/Construction","Automotive","Manufacturing","VFX/VP","GameDev"],skillFamily:"First Learning"},Gl={label:"Variables, Timers, and Events",url:"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/quick-start-guide-to-variables-timers-and-events-in-unreal-engine-cpp",description:"Expose variables and functions to the editor, use timers, and override C++ functions with Blueprints.",tags:["programming"],type:"Tutorial",parent:"programming-and-scripting\\programming-language-implementation\\cpp-in-unreal-engine\\tutorials",version:"4.21",sections:["1.

In Countdown.h, add the following lines to the end of our class definition:",'In Countdown.cpp, we can create our renderable text **Component** and initialize our countdown time to 3 seconds. We can also turn **Ticking** off for this type of **Actor**, since we will not need it. To do this, we must add the header for the Component at the top of the file, making the "include" section look like this:',"`ACountdown::UpdateTimerDisplay` should update our text display to show the time remaining, or zero if the time is up. This code should run when we first spawn our `ACountdown` into the game, and once per second until our `CountdownTime` variable hits zero.","Whenever we assign a **Timer** to run a function, we are given a **Timer Handle**. We need to hold onto that handle so that we can shut the Timer down when the countdown finishes. Let's add the function to count time down, and the Timer Handle we'll need to control it, to the class definition in `Countdown.h`. While we're there, let's also add a function to do something special when the countdown ends:","Let's initialize the text display in `ACountdown::BeginPlay` by adding a call to our new update function, and setting a timer to advance and update the countdown once per second:","Let's check our progress so far by going to the **Unreal Editor** and pressing **Compile**.","Our countdown timer is currently hard-coded to use a value of 3 seconds.

(To read more about this, see [Datasmith Reimport Workflow](working-with-content/datasmith/reimport-workflow).)","Currently, Datasmith is focused on translating your design content into forms that Unreal Engine can understand and render in real-time. Longer-term, the aim is to add more intelligent data preparation, tailoring the imported content for maximum runtime performance in the game engine, and adding smarter runtime behaviors.","You save or export your design data in a format that Datasmith can handle. Datasmith reads the native file format of many common CAD applications. For some applications, including 3ds Max and SketchUp Pro, you'll need to install a special plugin, which you'll use to export files with the `.udatasmith` extension. (See the [Datasmith Supported Software and File Types](working-with-content/datasmith/supported-software-and-file-types).)","In the Unreal Editor, you use the Datasmith Importer to bring the saved or exported file into your current Unreal Engine Project. At this point, you can control what data you want to bring in from that file, and set a few parameters that control the translation process. (See the [Datasmith Import Options](working-with-content/datasmith/import-options).)","**Lights -** If your scene contains any lights that use IES profiles to specify the way their intensities change over distance, the Datasmith importer places into this folder the Texture Assets that define those light intensities. For more information on IES Light Profiles in the Unreal Engine, see also [IES Light Profiles](building-virtual-worlds/lighting-and-shadows/features-of-lights/ies-profiles).","**Animations -** If your scene contains objects with position, rotation, or scale values that change over time, the Datasmith importer converts those animations into Sequence Assets. You can use these Sequences to replay the animations from your source scene within the Unreal Engine or Unreal Editor. For details on how this conversion is carried out, see [Datasmith Import Process](working-with-content/datasmith/import-process).","It stores references to all the Static Mesh, Material and Texture Assets that were imported with it."],seeAlso:[{label:"Datasmith Reimport Workflow",docKey:"reimport-workflow"},{label:"Datasmith Supported Software and File Types",docKey:"supported-software-and-file-types"},{label:"Datasmith Import Options",docKey:"import-options"},{label:"Static Meshes",docKey:"static-meshes"},{label:"Materials",docKey:"materials"},{label:"Textures",docKey:"textures"},{label:"IES Light Profiles",docKey:"ies-profiles"},{label:"Datasmith Import Process",docKey:"import-process"},{label:"Light Types and Their Mobility",docKey:"light-types-and-mobility"},{label:"Camera Actor",docKey:"camera-actors"}],readTimeMinutes:11,sourcePath:"working-with-content/datasmith/Overview",track:["GameDev"],skillFamily:"Foundation",engineConcept:"Working with Content"},rp={label:"Datasmith Supported Platforms",url:"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/datasmith-supported-platforms",description:"Details what Datasmith features work on which different platforms.",tags:["datasmith","manufacturing","architecture","simulation","enterprise","reference"],type:"Reference",parent:"working-with-content/datasmith",version:"5.3",sections:["Supported File Formats by Platform","Rebuilding Unreal Engine from Source","Datasmith Export Plugins"],keySteps:[],seeAlso:[],readTimeMinutes:3,sourcePath:"working-with-content/datasmith/Platforms"},sp={label:"Archicad",url:"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-datasmith-with-archicad-in-unreal-engine",description:"How to import Datasmith scenes from Graphisoft Archicad into Unreal Engine.",tags:["archicad","datasmith"],type:"Tutorial",parent:"working-with-content/datasmith/software-interop-guides",version:"4.27",sections:["Archicad Workflows","Datasmith DirectLink","Export Workflow","Using the Datasmith Toolbar","Geometry, Layers, and Scene Hierarchy","HotLinks Modules","Materials","Standard Archicad Materials","GDL and Two-Sided Materials","Lights","Cameras","Metadata and Classifications","Actor Tags"],keySteps:["Use Area Shape and Size given in Photometric file","The key value uses a specific classifications, including:"],seeAlso:[],readTimeMinutes:6,sourcePath:"working-with-content/datasmith/software-interop-guides/Archicad"},lp={label:"Installation Notes",url:"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/datasmith-plugin-for-archicad-installation-notes",description:"Install the Datasmith plugin for Archiad to export content into Unreal Engine.",tags:["archicad","datasmith"],type:"Tutorial",parent:"working-with-content/datasmith/software-interop-guides/Archicad",version:"4.27",sections:["Installing the Datasmith Plugin for Archicad","End Result","Removing the Datasmith Exporter for Archicad"],keySteps:["Close any running instances of Archicad that you may have running on your machine.
