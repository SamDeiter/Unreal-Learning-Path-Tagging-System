Understand how this differs from skeletal animation and the implications for memory usage, especially with high-resolution meshes. Explain the internal data structures used by Unreal to represent Alembic data (e.g., vertex buffers, index buffers) and how they are managed by the engine's rendering pipeline.",

Discuss the different types of tracks available (e.g., transform tracks, material parameter tracks) and how they can be used to control Alembic animations. Explain the concept of 'master tracks' and how they can be used to control the overall timing of a sequence.",
