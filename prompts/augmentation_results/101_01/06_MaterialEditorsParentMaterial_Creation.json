      "title": "Understanding LERP Node Functionality",
      "concept": "The Lerp (Linear Interpolate) node blends between two input values based on a third input value that acts as a ratio (alpha). It's fundamental for creating smooth transitions and animations in materials.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of the Lerp node with three inputs (A, B, Alpha) and one output. Show how the output value changes as the Alpha input varies between 0 and 1. Illustrate the mathematical formula: Output = A + (B - A) * Alpha."
