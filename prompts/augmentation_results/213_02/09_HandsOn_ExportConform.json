      "concept": "The Metahuman Identity Solve leverages a non-linear least squares optimization algorithm to minimize the difference between the scanned mesh and a blendshape-based Metahuman template. It iteratively adjusts blendshape weights and pose to achieve the best fit, influenced by user-defined trackers and constraints.",

The conformed mesh provides a consistent UV space, allowing for projection-based or UV-based texture transfer. Understanding UV seams and texel density is crucial for minimizing artifacts.",

A geometrically accurate template ensures that lower LODs maintain the character's silhouette and that joints are placed optimally for realistic skeletal animation.",
