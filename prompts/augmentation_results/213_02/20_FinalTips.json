      "title": "Understanding the Role of Rigs in Unreal Engine",
      "concept": "The script builds a rig in Maya, but the critical concept is how this rig translates to a Control Rig asset within Unreal Engine. Control Rigs in UE5 provide a non-destructive way to animate and pose MetaHumans, driving skeletal mesh deformation through Blueprint logic.",

      "title": "DNA Calibration and Morph Targets",
      "concept": "DNA calibration fundamentally relies on morph targets (blend shapes) within the skeletal mesh. The calibration process adjusts the weights of these morph targets to achieve the desired shape and pose. Understanding how morph targets are stored and accessed in UE5's skeletal mesh is crucial.",

      "why": "The Maya rig serves as an intermediate step for creating animation controls. The ultimate goal is to translate this rig's functionality into a Control Rig asset within Unreal Engine, enabling runtime pose adjustments and animation. Without a clear understanding of Control Rigs, the Maya step seems disconnected.",

      "why": "DirectX11 impacts the viewport rendering in Maya, which affects how textures and shaders are displayed during the rigging process. While important for visual fidelity in Maya, the *real* concern is ensuring that the exported assets are compatible with the rendering pipeline in Unreal Engine. Mismatched rendering settings can lead to visual discrepancies when importing the rigged MetaHuman.",

    {
      "timestamp": "2:07",
      "procedural_step": "Assign the paths for the DNA file and the maps folder.",
      "why": "Correctly assigning paths ensures that the Maya script can locate the necessary data for building the rig. However, the deeper reason is to understand how this data translates into morph target adjustments and material parameter changes within Unreal Engine. Incorrect paths lead to a broken pipeline and a MetaHuman that doesn't reflect the intended customizations.",

      "why": "Loading the rig with textures in Maya is a visual confirmation step. The critical understanding is how these textures and rig controls will be represented and manipulated within Unreal Engine's material system and animation tools. Without this context, the Maya rig feels like an isolated deliverable.",
