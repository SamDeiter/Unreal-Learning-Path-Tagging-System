      "title": "Understanding LOD Bias",
      "concept": "Level of Detail (LOD) biasing in Unreal Engine 5 allows you to control the distance at which different LODs are displayed. This impacts rendering performance and visual fidelity. Understanding how LOD bias interacts with screen size and mesh density is crucial for optimization.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A graph showing screen size vs. distance, with different LOD curves illustrating the effect of LOD bias."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:57",
      "title": "DNA Calibration and Morph Targets",
      "concept": "DNA calibration modifies the underlying morph targets of the MetaHuman. These morph targets are blended at runtime to achieve the desired facial expression or shape. Understanding the relationship between DNA parameters and morph target weights is essential for advanced customization.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of how DNA parameters map to morph target weights in the MetaHuman's skeletal mesh."

    {
      "timestamp": "0:00",
      "procedural_step": "Export head LODs as FBX files.",
      "why": "Exporting LODs as FBX is necessary because the engine needs discrete mesh assets for each LOD level. This allows the engine to swap meshes based on distance, optimizing rendering performance. Without this, the engine would have to calculate LODs at runtime, which is computationally expensive.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },

      "timestamp": "4:16",
      "procedural_step": "Copy modified DNA file to the DNA files folder.",
      "why": "The DNA file contains the updated morph target weights. Placing it in the correct directory ensures that the MetaHuman identity is correctly updated when re-imported into Unreal Engine. Failing to do so will result in the MetaHuman reverting to its original shape.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:52",
      "procedural_step": "Add material placeholders to head geometry assets.",
      "why": "Material placeholders are needed because the FBX export process doesn't automatically transfer material assignments. Without these placeholders, the imported meshes will lack assigned materials, resulting in a default, untextured appearance in the engine. This is crucial for the correct visual representation of the MetaHuman.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "7:38",
      "procedural_step": "Name geometry assets with the correct naming convention.",
      "why": "Correct naming conventions are critical for the MetaHuman system to properly recognize and assign materials to the different components (head, teeth, eyes, etc.). Incorrect naming will break the material assignment pipeline, leading to visual errors and potentially crashing the material editor due to unresolved dependencies.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:12",
      "prompt": "Why is a prepared body skeleton file required for the export FBX script?",
      "expected_insight": "The script needs a base skeleton to correctly align and scale the head LODs during the export process. This ensures that the head meshes are properly integrated with the MetaHuman body in Unreal Engine. Without it, the head might be misaligned or scaled incorrectly."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:03",
      "prompt": "What are the performance implications of skipping the LOD export step and using only LOD0?",
      "expected_insight": "Skipping LODs would force the engine to render the highest-resolution mesh even at a distance, severely impacting performance, especially in scenes with multiple MetaHumans. This would increase GPU load and potentially lead to frame rate drops."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:08",
      "prompt": "Why can't the material assignment be automated directly within the export script?",
      "expected_insight": "The FBX format has limitations in transferring complex material setups specific to Unreal Engine. The script focuses on geometry export, and material assignment is handled separately to ensure compatibility and flexibility within the Unreal Engine material editor."

    {
      "timestamp": "5:52",
      "warning": "Manually assigning materials can lead to inconsistencies and errors, especially when dealing with multiple LODs. This increases the risk of human error and makes it difficult to maintain a consistent look across all LOD levels.",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "fix": "Implement a robust material instance system with parent materials to ensure consistent material properties across all LODs. Use a naming convention that allows for automated material assignment based on mesh names."
