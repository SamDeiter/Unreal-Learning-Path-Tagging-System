      "procedural_step": "Fracture mode allows cinematic quality fractures",
      "why": "Because Chaos Destruction leverages a highly optimized physics engine designed for real-time performance, enabling complex fracture simulations without significant performance overhead. This is achieved through techniques like clustered physics and adaptive level of detail.",

      "timestamp": "1:32",
      "procedural_step": "Set Break Damage Propagation to 5",
