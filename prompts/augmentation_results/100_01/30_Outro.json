      "title": "Understanding the Modular Architecture of Unreal Engine 5",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine 5's architecture is designed around modularity. This means features and tools are implemented as independent modules that can be enabled or disabled as needed. This allows developers to tailor the engine to their specific project requirements, reducing bloat and improving performance. Understanding this modularity is crucial for efficient project management and optimization.",

Understanding how the engine handles assets, including its use of asynchronous loading and level streaming, is critical for creating large, performant worlds. Explore the implications of different asset types (textures, meshes, animations) on memory usage and performance.",
