      "title": "Material Blending Fundamentals",
      "concept": "Material blending in UE5 relies on the Material Editor's ability to combine multiple material functions based on vertex color or texture masks. Understanding the math behind these blends (lerps, adds, multiplies) is crucial for predictable results.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of a Lerp (Linear Interpolation) node within the Material Editor, showing two input materials and a mask controlling the blend."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:44",
      "title": "Texture Sampling and UV Coordinates",
      "concept": "Painting textures directly onto a mesh involves understanding UV coordinates and texture sampling. UE5 uses UVs to map a 2D texture onto a 3D surface. The Mesh Paint tool modifies these UVs or the texture data itself, impacting how the texture appears on the mesh.",

      "title": "Vertex Color Interpolation",
      "concept": "Vertex colors are stored per-vertex and interpolated across the faces of the mesh. This interpolation creates the smooth gradients observed when painting. The density of the mesh's vertices directly affects the resolution of the vertex color detail.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing how vertex colors are interpolated across a triangle, with color values at each vertex and a gradient in between."

      "timestamp": "0:09",
      "procedural_step": "Blending between two different materials.",
      "why": "Blending materials using Mesh Paint enables localized material variations, such as adding dirt or wear to specific areas of a mesh. This avoids the performance cost of creating entirely new material instances for minor visual differences.",

      "timestamp": "0:54",
      "procedural_step": "Painting vertex colors.",
      "why": "Painting vertex colors allows for dynamic material effects driven by the mesh itself. This can be used for effects like heatmaps, procedural damage, or interactive elements that respond to player actions. Vertex colors are stored per-vertex, so higher polycount meshes will support higher resolution detail.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:49",
      "prompt": "How does the mesh's vertex density affect the quality of vertex color painting?",
