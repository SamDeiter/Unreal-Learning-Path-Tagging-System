      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:49",
      "prompt": "How does Nanite achieve high visual fidelity without sacrificing performance? What are the limitations of Nanite when applied to Landscapes?",
      "expected_insight": "Nanite uses a virtualized geometry system to dynamically tessellate the landscape based on viewing distance. This allows for high detail close to the camera while reducing the polygon count in the distance. However, Nanite requires additional memory and processing power for data preparation and may not be suitable for all hardware configurations."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:33",
      "prompt": "What are the alternatives to increasing the base tessellation of a Landscape? When would you choose static meshes or displacement over Landscape tools?",
      "expected_insight": "Static meshes offer more control over individual details but can be less efficient for large terrains. Displacement mapping can add surface detail without increasing the polygon count, but it can be computationally expensive. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the scene and the target hardware."
