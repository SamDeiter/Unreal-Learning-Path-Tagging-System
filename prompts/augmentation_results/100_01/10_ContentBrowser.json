      "title": "Asset Management & Dependency Tracking",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine's asset management system automatically tracks dependencies between assets. Understanding this dependency graph is crucial for efficient project management and preventing broken references. Changes to one asset can propagate to others, impacting performance and stability.",

      "title": "Content Browser Settings Persistence",
      "concept": "Content Browser settings (like view type, thumbnail size, and filter settings) are persisted per-project and per-user. This means that each user can customize their Content Browser experience without affecting others. Understanding where these settings are stored (in the project's Config folder) allows for advanced customization and troubleshooting.",

      "concept": "The Content Browser indexes assets to enable fast searching and filtering. Understanding how the indexing process works (e.g., how often it updates, what metadata is indexed) is crucial for optimizing search performance, especially in large projects. Incorrectly configured indexing can lead to slow searches and inaccurate results.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:07",
      "procedural_step": "Saving modified assets",
      "why": "Saving modified assets ensures that changes are written to disk, preventing data loss and ensuring consistency across the project. Failing to save regularly can lead to significant rework and potential corruption of the project's asset database.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:06",
      "procedural_step": "Showing Engine Content",
      "why": "Displaying engine content allows you to inspect and potentially reuse engine-provided assets. However, directly modifying engine content can break engine updates and introduce instability. It's generally better to copy and modify engine assets within your project's content folder.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:16",
      "procedural_step": "Using search and filter",
      "why": "Efficiently searching and filtering assets is crucial for maintaining a manageable project. Without proper organization and search techniques, finding specific assets becomes increasingly difficult as the project grows, leading to wasted time and potential errors.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:09",
      "prompt": "Why does Unreal Engine separate 'basic' and 'advanced' asset creation options? What underlying system governs this distinction?",
      "expected_insight": "The separation reflects the complexity of asset creation. 'Basic' assets are typically self-contained, while 'advanced' assets often involve intricate dependencies on other systems like animation blueprints or physics assets. This separation helps manage cognitive load."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:23",
      "prompt": "How does the Content Browser's navigation system relate to the underlying file system structure of the project? What are the implications for asset organization and long-term project maintainability?",
      "expected_insight": "The Content Browser mirrors the project's file system. A well-organized file system translates to a navigable Content Browser, improving team collaboration and asset discoverability. Poor organization leads to chaos and wasted time."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:30",
      "prompt": "Why would you need to access engine content directly? What are the potential risks and benefits of doing so, compared to creating your own assets from scratch?",
      "expected_insight": "Accessing engine content can provide a starting point for customization or debugging. However, directly modifying engine assets can break engine updates. Copying and modifying is safer but requires more initial effort."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:13",
      "prompt": "Why is a powerful search function so critical in a large Unreal Engine project? How does the search functionality contribute to optimization and performance?",
      "expected_insight": "A powerful search function allows developers to quickly identify and address performance bottlenecks, such as overly complex meshes or high-resolution textures. It also aids in identifying unused assets that can be removed to reduce project size."
