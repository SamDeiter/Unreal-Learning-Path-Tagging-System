The increased texture resolution and complex materials demand more GPU resources, potentially leading to frame rate drops on lower-end hardware. This is due to increased memory bandwidth and shader instruction costs.",

      "expected_insight": "Lower quality Metahumans reduce memory footprint and GPU processing requirements, making them suitable for projects targeting lower-end hardware or requiring a large number of characters on screen simultaneously. The trade-off is reduced visual fidelity."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:56",
      "prompt": "What are the potential consequences of modifying Metahuman components directly in the level versus within the Metahuman Blueprint?",

      "prompt": "What are the limitations of using Control Rigs for final animation compared to traditional animation sequences?",
