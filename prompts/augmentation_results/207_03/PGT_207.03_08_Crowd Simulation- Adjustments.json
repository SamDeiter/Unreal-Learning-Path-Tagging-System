      "title": "Understanding Blend Spaces",
      "concept": "Blend spaces in Unreal Engine 5 are used to smoothly transition between animations based on input parameters, typically movement speed and direction. They are essentially lookup tables that determine which animation pose to play at any given moment. The engine interpolates between these poses to create a seamless visual effect.",

      "title": "Event-Driven Gameplay with Delay Nodes",
      "concept": "Delay nodes in Unreal Engine 5 introduce asynchronous execution flow. They pause the execution of a Blueprint script for a specified duration before continuing. This is crucial for creating timed events, controlling the pace of gameplay, and decoupling actions to prevent frame rate dependency.",

      "timestamp": "2:10",
      "procedural_step": "Adding a delay",
