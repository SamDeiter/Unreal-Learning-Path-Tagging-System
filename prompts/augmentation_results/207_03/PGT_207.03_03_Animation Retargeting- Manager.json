      "procedural_step": "Renaming assets and fixing up redirectors.",
      "why": "Renaming assets without fixing up redirectors can lead to broken references and asset loading failures. The engine uses these redirectors to locate assets, and failing to update them can cause runtime errors and wasted memory as the engine searches for the old location.",

      "timestamp": "4:13",
      "procedural_step": "Selecting the Humanoid Rig.",

      "timestamp": "5:57",
      "procedural_step": "Setting Humanoid Rig on both skeletons.",
      "why": "Setting the Humanoid Rig on both source and target skeletons is crucial for establishing a shared understanding of bone relationships. Without this, the retargeting process will fail, resulting in distorted or broken animations due to mismatched bone hierarchies.",

      "timestamp": "6:18",
      "procedural_step": "Setting Translation Retargeting Options.",
      "why": "Setting Translation Retargeting Options controls how animation data is applied to different bones. Incorrect settings can lead to unnatural or exaggerated movements, as the engine fails to account for differences in character proportions and skeletal structure.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "9:33",
      "procedural_step": "Retargeting Animation Assets.",
      "why": "Retargeting animation assets allows you to reuse existing animations on different characters. This saves significant development time and resources, as you don't need to create new animations for each character from scratch. Proper bone mapping is essential for this to work correctly.",

  "self_explanation_prompts": [
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:48",
      "prompt": "Why might a game developer choose to include bones with zero influence on the mesh?",
      "expected_insight": "Including bones with zero influence allows for future expansion of the character's animation capabilities without requiring a complete skeletal rebuild. It provides flexibility for adding new features or customization options later in development."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:23",
      "prompt": "What are the trade-offs between saving the bone mapping to its own asset file versus relying on the default settings?",
      "expected_insight": "Saving the bone mapping to its own asset file allows for greater control and reusability, especially in complex setups. However, it adds complexity and requires careful management. Relying on default settings is simpler but may not be suitable for all characters or animation styles."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:48",
      "prompt": "Why is the 'Animation Scaled' setting particularly important for the pelvis bone?",
      "expected_insight": "The 'Animation Scaled' setting for the pelvis allows the animation to adapt to characters of different heights. By scaling the animation based on the pelvis height, the engine ensures that the character's feet remain planted on the ground and that the overall movement looks natural, regardless of the character's size."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "8:50",
      "prompt": "What problems can arise if the poses of the source and target skeletons are significantly different before retargeting?",
      "expected_insight": "If the poses are different, the retargeted animation may result in unnatural joint rotations or extreme bone stretching. This can lead to visual artifacts and animation glitches, requiring manual adjustments to correct the pose before retargeting."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "11:15",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to rename retargeted animations and place them in a dedicated folder?",
      "expected_insight": "Renaming and organizing retargeted animations prevents confusion and ensures that the original animations are not accidentally overwritten. This also improves project organization and makes it easier to locate and manage animation assets."
