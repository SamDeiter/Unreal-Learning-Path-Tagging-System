    {
      "timestamp": "1:26",
      "procedural_step": "Animations are shared because they share the MetaHuman based skeleton.",
      "why": "Sharing the same skeleton allows the engine to efficiently retarget animations between different MetaHumans, reducing memory usage and development time. Without a shared skeleton, each MetaHuman would require its own unique set of animations, leading to significant asset duplication.",

      "why": "Rik (Retargeting and IK) logic enables animation retargeting, allowing animations created for one MetaHuman to be applied to others, even with slight variations in body shape or proportions. This reduces the need to create separate animations for each MetaHuman, saving significant development time and resources.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:42",
      "prompt": "Why is modularity important for MetaHumans?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:23",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to transfer skinning and LOD templates when creating custom clothing?",
      "expected_insight": "Transferring skinning ensures that the clothing deforms correctly with the character's movements. Transferring LOD templates ensures that the clothing's complexity is reduced appropriately as the character moves further away from the camera, optimizing performance."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:25",
      "prompt": "Why is it useful to adjust physics properties on clothing?",
      "expected_insight": "Adjusting physics properties allows you to control how clothing reacts to the character's movements and the environment. This can add realism and visual interest to the character. For example, adjusting the stiffness of the hoodie strings can affect how they swing and bounce."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "9:07",
      "prompt": "Why does the MetaHuman face have a large number of blend shapes?",
      "expected_insight": "The large number of blend shapes allows for a wide range of facial expressions and realistic lip syncing. Each blend shape corresponds to a specific facial muscle movement, allowing for fine-grained control over the character's facial animation."
