      "title": "Plugin Architecture",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine's plugin system allows modular extension of the engine's functionality. Plugins can contain new features, content, and code that can be enabled or disabled as needed. This modularity promotes code reuse and reduces the engine's core footprint.",

This registry indexes all assets in the project, allowing for efficient searching and filtering based on asset type, name, and metadata. Understanding how the asset registry works is crucial for managing large projects.",
