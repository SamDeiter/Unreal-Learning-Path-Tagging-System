      "concept": "Sequencer is Unreal Engine 5's non-linear animation and cinematic tool. It operates on the principle of keyframe animation and track overrides, allowing for precise control over actor properties and scene elements over time. Understanding its architecture, including the relationship between Master Sequences, Level Sequences, and Spawnables, is crucial for efficient cinematic creation.",

      "concept": "The Render Queue in Unreal Engine 5 is a system for managing and executing rendering jobs, especially for offline rendering. It allows you to define render settings, output formats, and frame ranges, and then process these jobs in a controlled and automated manner. Understanding the Render Queue's capabilities, such as multi-GPU rendering and tile rendering, is essential for optimizing render times and quality.",

It uses Surface Cache and Software Ray Tracing to provide high-quality lighting without the need for precomputed lightmaps. Understanding Lumen's limitations, such as its reliance on screen-space data and its performance impact on lower-end hardware, is crucial for effective use.",
