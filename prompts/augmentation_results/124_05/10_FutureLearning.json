      "concept": "State Trees in Unreal Engine 5 offer a hierarchical, event-driven system for managing AI behavior. They allow for modular and reusable AI logic, enabling complex behaviors to be built from simpler states and transitions. Understanding the underlying architecture, including state nodes, transitions, and decorators, is crucial for effective AI design.",

Understanding how different state trees can be dynamically assigned and switched based on object properties is key to creating versatile and adaptable Smart Object behaviors.",

      "why": "Decoupling AI logic into separate State Trees promotes modularity and reusability. This reduces the complexity of a single monolithic AI script, improving maintainability and scalability, especially in large projects like Fortnite or Lego games. This also allows for easier debugging and modification of specific AI behaviors without affecting the entire system.",

      "why": "Dynamically switching between State Trees based on the Smart Object allows for context-aware behavior. This enables the AI to react differently depending on the object it's interacting with, creating a more believable and engaging experience. For example, an AI interacting with a crafting station might use a different state tree than when interacting with a combat scenario.",

The AI's behavior adapts to the specific object it's interacting with, making the interaction feel more natural and responsive."
