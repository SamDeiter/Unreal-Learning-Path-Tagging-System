      "title": "Understanding DNA Calibration in UE5",
      "concept": "The DNA calibration process refines the blend shapes and skeletal proportions of a MetaHuman to match a custom body. This involves adjusting parameters within the MetaHuman Identity system to ensure seamless integration and realistic deformation. It leverages the Control Rig system for posing and validation.",

      "title": "Extending Joint Information and its Impact on Animation",
      "concept": "Extending the joint information from the body rig to the DNA-derived joints ensures that the animation system in Unreal Engine 5 can properly drive the head and body together. This relies on the skeletal hierarchy and the animation retargeting system to maintain consistent motion. Incorrect joint setup can lead to animation artifacts and deformation issues.",

      "why": "Validating the skin weight merge is critical because mismatched skin weights will cause visual artifacts during animation. These artifacts manifest as seams or distortions, breaking the illusion of a single, unified mesh. This impacts the visual fidelity and believability of the MetaHuman.",

      "timestamp": "3:11",
      "procedural_step": "Extracting joint information from the body rig.",
      "why": "Extending the joint hierarchy is necessary because the initial DNA only contains a subset of the joints required for full body animation. Without the root, spine, neck, and shoulder joints, the head will not move correctly with the body, leading to disconnected and unrealistic movement. This ensures proper skeletal control within the animation system.",

Assigning shaders ensures the correct materials are applied to each LOD, maintaining visual consistency while improving efficiency.",
