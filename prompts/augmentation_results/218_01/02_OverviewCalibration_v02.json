      "title": "Understanding Lens Distortion Modeling in Unreal Engine",
      "concept": "The Camera Calibration plugin uses mathematical models to represent lens distortion. These models (e.g., Brown-Conrady) correct for radial and tangential distortions introduced by the lens. Understanding the underlying math is crucial for troubleshooting calibration errors.",

      "title": "Interpolating Calibration Data",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine interpolates between stored focus and zoom points to estimate lens parameters for intermediate values. This interpolation relies on assumptions about the lens's behavior. Understanding these assumptions helps predict calibration accuracy.",

      "why": "Accurate calibration ensures that the virtual camera's parameters (position, rotation, focal length, distortion) match the physical camera. Mismatched parameters lead to incorrect compositing, causing CG elements to appear misaligned or distorted in the final image.",

      "procedural_step": "Sync video feed and camera tracking",
