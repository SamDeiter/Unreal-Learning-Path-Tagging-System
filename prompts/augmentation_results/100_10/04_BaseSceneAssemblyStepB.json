      "title": "EV and Exposure Control",
      "concept": "Exposure Value (EV) is a numerical representation of luminance. Understanding how EV relates to scene lighting and camera settings is essential for achieving realistic and consistent exposure across different environments. UE5's auto-exposure system attempts to simulate a real-world camera.",

      "procedural_step": "Using a post-processing volume",
      "why": "Post-processing volumes allow for global or localized adjustments to the rendered image, affecting exposure, color grading, and other visual effects. This provides a centralized control point for artistic look development and optimization. They are more efficient than individual material-based post-processing.",

      "timestamp": "2:16",
      "procedural_step": "Setting Exposure Compensation to -5.5",
      "why": "Exposure compensation adjusts the overall brightness of the scene. A negative value darkens the image, which is often necessary to achieve realistic exposure levels when using physically based lighting. This value counteracts the default auto-exposure behavior.",

      "timestamp": "2:53",
      "procedural_step": "Clamping Min and Max EV values",
      "why": "Clamping the minimum and maximum EV values disables auto-exposure. This prevents the engine from automatically adjusting the brightness of the scene based on the current view, providing consistent exposure regardless of lighting conditions. This is crucial for achieving a specific artistic look.",

      "why": "Disabling these effects removes artistic stylization, providing a clean base for automotive visualization. Chromatic aberration simulates lens distortion, while bloom adds a glow around bright areas. Removing them allows for a more neutral and realistic representation of the vehicle.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:36",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to reset the transformation of the Post Process Volume?",
      "expected_insight": "Resetting the transformation ensures the volume's origin is at the world origin, making it easier to manage and scale its influence globally. It avoids unintended local transformations that could skew the effect."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:46",
      "prompt": "How would the scene look different if 'Infinite Extent (Unbound)' was NOT checked?",
      "expected_insight": "The post-processing effects would only be visible when the camera is inside the volume's bounds. Outside the volume, the scene would revert to the default post-processing settings, creating a jarring transition."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:36",
      "prompt": "What would happen if the Min EV and Max EV values were set to different values?",
      "expected_insight": "The auto-exposure system would be enabled within the specified EV range, causing the scene brightness to automatically adjust based on the current lighting conditions. This could lead to inconsistent exposure levels."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:15",
      "prompt": "Why might you want to use multiple post-processing volumes in a scene?",
      "expected_insight": "Multiple volumes allow for localized effects, such as blurring the background or applying different color grading to specific areas. This provides greater control over the final look of the scene."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:43",
      "prompt": "How does the order of post-processing effects impact the final image?",
      "expected_insight": "The order in which effects are applied can significantly alter the final result. For example, applying bloom before color grading will produce a different outcome than applying color grading before bloom. Understanding the order is crucial for achieving the desired look."
