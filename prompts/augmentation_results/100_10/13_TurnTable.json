      "title": "Lumen Global Illumination",
      "concept": "Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system. It reacts to scene and light changes on the fly without requiring precomputed lightmaps. Understanding how different material properties (roughness, metallic) interact with Lumen is crucial for realistic automotive visualization.",

      "concept": "The Post-Process Volume allows for global image adjustments, including exposure, color grading, and bloom. Tone mapping converts the high dynamic range (HDR) scene data into a low dynamic range (LDR) image suitable for display. Understanding the relationship between exposure, tone mapping, and the physical light values in the scene is essential for achieving a cinematic look.",

      "timestamp": "1:15",
      "procedural_step": "Adding Rotation Movement component",
      "why": "The Rotation Movement component directly manipulates the actor's transform. While simple, directly modifying transforms bypasses the physics engine, which is acceptable for a turntable but can lead to visual artifacts if used for complex, physics-driven animations.",
