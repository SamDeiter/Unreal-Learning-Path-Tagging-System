      "title": "Understanding Project Templates and Plugin Management",
      "concept": "Project templates in Unreal Engine 5 are essentially pre-configured project settings and plugin sets. They streamline the initial setup but don't fundamentally alter the engine's core functionality. Understanding how to manually enable/disable plugins and modify project settings is crucial for project customization and optimization.",

      "title": "Render Hardware Interface (RHI) Abstraction",
      "concept": "The Render Hardware Interface (RHI) is an abstraction layer that allows Unreal Engine 5 to communicate with different graphics APIs (like DirectX 12, Vulkan, Metal). Choosing the correct RHI is critical for performance and compatibility on different platforms. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of each RHI is essential for optimizing rendering pipelines.",

      "why": "Templates streamline project setup by pre-configuring settings and enabling plugins relevant to automotive visualization. This reduces initial setup time but understanding the underlying configurations is crucial for customization and troubleshooting. For example, the Datasmith importer is enabled to facilitate importing CAD data.",

      "timestamp": "2:56",
      "procedural_step": "Default RHI is changed to DirectX 12.",
