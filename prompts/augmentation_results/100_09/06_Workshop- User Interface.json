      "title": "Understanding Rendering Modes",
      "concept": "The 'Modes' toolbar provides access to different editors that fundamentally alter how the scene is rendered and interacted with. Foliage and Landscape modes, for example, switch the engine into specialized rendering pipelines optimized for those content types. Understanding these pipelines is crucial for performance.",

      "concept": "The 'Cinematics' button launches the Sequencer, Unreal Engine's non-linear animation and cinematic editing tool. Sequencer leverages the engine's animation and rendering capabilities to create high-quality cinematics. Understanding Sequencer's architecture, including tracks, keyframes, and animation binding, is essential for effective cinematic creation.",

It handles asset dependencies, version control (if integrated with source control), and streaming. Understanding how the Content Browser organizes and manages assets is critical for project scalability and collaboration.",
