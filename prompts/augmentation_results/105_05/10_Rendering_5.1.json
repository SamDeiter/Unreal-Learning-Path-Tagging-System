      "title": "Movie Render Queue Architecture",
      "concept": "The Movie Render Queue (MRQ) is a modular, extensible system built on Render Graph architecture. It allows deferred rendering and post-processing, enabling features like high-resolution tiling and accumulation. Understanding its job-based structure is crucial for optimization.",

      "title": "HDR Encoding and Color Gamut",
      "concept": "HDR (High Dynamic Range) export involves encoding scene luminance values beyond the standard 0-1 range. OpenEXR is a common format. The capture gamut defines the range of colors that can be recorded, impacting the fidelity of the final output. Incorrect gamut settings can lead to color clipping or inaccurate representation.",

      "concept": "Render passes (e.g., base color, specular, ambient occlusion) decompose the final rendered image into its constituent parts. This allows for flexible compositing and post-processing in external software. Understanding which passes to use and how they interact is essential for achieving desired visual effects.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing a scene being rendered into multiple render passes (e.g., diffuse, specular, normal), and then composited back together to form the final image. Show how each pass contributes to the final look."
