      "concept": "Explain how Mixer's 'smart material' approach relates to Unreal Engine's Material Instance system. Material Instances allow you to create variations of a base material without recompiling the shader, saving significant time and resources. Discuss the performance implications of using complex material graphs versus optimized material instances.",

Render Targets allow you to dynamically generate textures at runtime, which can then be used as masks in your materials. Discuss the memory overhead associated with Render Targets and strategies for optimizing their usage (e.g., using lower resolutions or shared Render Targets).",

Relate this to Unreal Engine's UV coordinate system and the importance of proper UV unwrapping for avoiding visual artifacts. Discuss the performance implications of different UV mapping techniques, especially on complex meshes.",
