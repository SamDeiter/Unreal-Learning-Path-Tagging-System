      "title": "Understanding Lightmap Generation",
      "concept": "The video mentions lightmap values but doesn't explain the underlying process. Lightmaps are pre-computed textures storing lighting information. UE5 uses them as a fallback for static lighting scenarios, even with Lumen. Understanding lightmap resolution impacts memory footprint and visual fidelity.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating the lightmap baking process, showing how scene geometry is unwrapped, lighting is calculated, and the resulting texture is applied."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:54",
      "title": "Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections",
      "concept": "The video mentions Lumen but doesn't explain its role. Lumen is UE5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system. It eliminates the need for precomputed lighting in many scenarios, but understanding its limitations (e.g., performance cost, indirect lighting quality) is crucial.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A comparison diagram showing the difference between static lighting (with lightmaps) and dynamic global illumination (Lumen), highlighting the trade-offs in performance and visual quality."

      "title": "Datasmith Scene Hierarchy Preservation",
      "concept": "The video mentions hierarchy preservation. Datasmith maintains the scene graph from the source CAD or DCC application. This is crucial for selective updates and non-destructive workflows. Changes in the source application can be selectively propagated to the UE5 scene without rebuilding everything.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A before-and-after diagram showing a scene hierarchy in a CAD program and its corresponding representation in the UE5 World Outliner after Datasmith import."

      "procedural_step": "Choosing import options (geometry, materials, textures, lights, cameras, animations)",

      "timestamp": "1:48",
      "procedural_step": "Unchecking 'generate light map UVs'",
      "why": "Disabling lightmap UV generation reduces import time and asset size, but it forces the engine to rely solely on Lumen for lighting, potentially impacting performance in complex scenes or on lower-end hardware. It also prevents fallback to baked lighting if Lumen is disabled.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:23",
      "procedural_step": "Adjusting the origin of the imported project",
      "why": "Modifying the root actor's transform affects the entire scene's world position. Incorrect origin placement can lead to rendering artifacts (e.g., shadow clipping, precision issues) far from the world origin. This is because floating-point precision decreases with distance from the origin.",

      "timestamp": "2:35",
      "procedural_step": "Re-importing the Datasmith file",
      "why": "Re-importing updates the scene based on changes in the source file. This allows for iterative design workflows, but it can also overwrite manual adjustments made in the UE5 editor if 'respawn deleted actors' is enabled, potentially leading to data loss.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:30",
      "procedural_step": "Being unable to re-import a Datasmith scene",
      "why": "Without the source Datasmith file, the connection between the UE5 scene and the original design is broken. This prevents updates and requires manual reconstruction of any changes made in the source application, negating the benefits of the Datasmith workflow.",
