      "procedural_step": "Enabling 'Infinite Extent Unbound' on the Post-Processing Volume.",
      "why": "This ensures the post-processing settings apply to the entire scene, regardless of the camera's position. Without it, the effect would only be active within the volume's bounds, leading to inconsistent visuals as the camera moves.",

    },

      "timestamp": "1:11",
      "procedural_step": "Clamping Min and Max EV values.",
      "why": "Clamping exposure values prevents the auto-exposure system from over- or underexposing the scene, which can be distracting in cinematic sequences. This provides consistent brightness levels, crucial for maintaining visual continuity.",

      "timestamp": "3:39",
      "procedural_step": "Using lower path tracing settings in the editor.",
      "why": "Lower settings reduce the computational load on the GPU, allowing for faster iteration and smoother viewport performance. This is essential for interactive editing, even though it sacrifices visual fidelity in the editor.",

      "timestamp": "4:40",
      "procedural_step": "Setting Spatial and Temporal Sample Counts to 10 in Movie Render Queue.",
      "why": "Increasing sample counts reduces noise and aliasing in the final rendered image. Spatial samples control the number of samples taken per pixel, while temporal samples accumulate samples over multiple frames. Higher values lead to cleaner results at the cost of increased render time.",

    },

      "timestamp": "5:10",
      "procedural_step": "Overriding console variables in Movie Render Queue.",
      "why": "This allows you to use lower-quality settings in the editor for performance and then override them with higher-quality settings during the final render. This separation optimizes the workflow for both interactive editing and final output quality.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "7:22",
      "procedural_step": "Disabling the Skylight when 'Reference Atmosphere' is enabled.",
      "why": "When 'Reference Atmosphere' is enabled, the path tracer directly calculates atmospheric scattering, providing more accurate results. The Skylight's baked contribution is then redundant and disabled to avoid double-lighting and incorrect color contributions.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "8:39",
      "procedural_step": "Disabling the emissive pass.",
      "why": "In scenes with strong emissive materials, disabling the emissive pass can prevent double lighting calculations, which can lead to overly bright or incorrect lighting. This ensures that emissive materials contribute the correct amount of light to the scene.",

  "self_explanation_prompts": [
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:48",
      "prompt": "Why does moving the camera cause the path tracer to recalculate the scene?",
      "expected_insight": "Path tracing is a view-dependent rendering technique. It calculates the light paths from the camera's perspective. Changing the camera position alters these paths, requiring a recalculation to maintain accuracy."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:31",
      "prompt": "Why is it beneficial to decouple editor settings from render settings?",
      "expected_insight": "Decoupling allows for a responsive editor experience with lower-quality settings while still achieving high-quality final renders by overriding those settings during the rendering process. This balances performance and visual fidelity."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:39",
      "prompt": "Why are console variables used in Movie Render Queue instead of directly modifying the post-processing volume?",
      "expected_insight": "Console variables provide a non-destructive way to override settings specifically for rendering, leaving the editor's post-processing volume untouched for optimal performance during editing. This ensures that changes only affect the final output."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:59",
      "prompt": "Why would disabling indirect specular reflections improve performance?",
      "expected_insight": "Indirect specular reflections require tracing additional rays to calculate reflections from other surfaces. Disabling them reduces the number of rays traced, improving performance, especially in complex scenes with many reflective surfaces."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "9:08",
      "prompt": "Why did older versions of Unreal Engine have issues with translucency and depth of field in the path tracer?",
      "expected_insight": "Path tracing requires accurate depth information for effects like depth of field and correct handling of transparent surfaces. Older implementations may have lacked the necessary precision or algorithms to handle these effects correctly, leading to artifacts or incorrect rendering."
