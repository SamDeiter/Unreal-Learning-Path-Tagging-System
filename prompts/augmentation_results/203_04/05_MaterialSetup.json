      "concept": "Path Tracer relies on physically-based shading models (like Default Lit or Subsurface) to accurately simulate light transport. Non-PBR shading models will produce unpredictable results. The choice of shading model dictates how the material interacts with light in the path tracing algorithm, influencing realism and energy conservation.",

      "concept": "Blending modes determine how a material is composited with the background. Opaque materials are ideal for Path Tracer, while translucent materials require careful consideration due to increased computational cost and potential noise. Understanding the implications of blending modes on light transport is crucial for achieving desired visual effects.",

      "concept": "Path Tracer simulates light interaction within the volume of objects. Therefore, the thickness of the geometry significantly affects how light is absorbed, scattered, and transmitted. Thin, single-sided geometry can lead to inaccurate or unexpected results, especially for translucent or refractive materials. Proper modeling practices are essential for achieving realistic effects.",

      "why": "Path Tracer simulates light transport based on these parameters. Incorrect settings can lead to unrealistic or physically implausible results, breaking immersion and visual fidelity. Shading models define how light interacts with the surface; blending modes determine how the material is composited; lighting modes control how the material receives and emits light.",

      "why": "Path Tracer calculates light interaction within the volume of objects. Incorrectly sized or paper-thin meshes will cause light to behave unnaturally, violating energy conservation and creating visual artifacts. This is because the path tracer simulates light transport through the volume of the object, and single-sided geometry doesn't provide a valid volume.",
