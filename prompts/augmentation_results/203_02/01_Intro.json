      "title": "Lumen Global Illumination",
      "concept": "Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system. It reacts to scene and lighting changes in real-time, eliminating the need for precomputed lighting in many scenarios. It uses Software Ray Tracing and Surface Cache to achieve high-quality results.",

      "title": "Exposure Control in UE5",
      "concept": "Exposure in UE5 simulates the behavior of a camera's aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. It determines the overall brightness of the scene. Auto Exposure dynamically adjusts these settings based on the scene's luminance, while Manual Exposure allows for precise artistic control.",

      "concept": "Baked lighting precomputes lighting information and stores it in lightmaps. This is efficient but static. Dynamic lighting calculates lighting in real-time, offering flexibility but at a higher performance cost. Lumen is a form of dynamic lighting.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A comparison chart highlighting the pros and cons of baked lighting (static lighting) and dynamic lighting (Lumen)."

      "title": "Lightmass and Lightmaps",
      "concept": "Lightmass is UE5's static lighting baking system. It generates lightmaps, which are textures storing precomputed lighting information. These are applied to static meshes to simulate indirect lighting and shadows efficiently. GPU Lightmass accelerates this process using the GPU.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual breakdown of the Lightmass process: scene analysis, ray tracing, lightmap generation, and application to meshes."

      "concept": "UE5 offers various reflection techniques, including Screen Space Reflections (SSR), Lumen Reflections, and Ray Traced Reflections. SSR is a fast but limited technique, while Lumen Reflections provide dynamic reflections based on the Lumen scene representation. Ray Traced Reflections offer the highest quality but are the most performance-intensive.",
