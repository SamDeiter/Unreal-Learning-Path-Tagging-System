      "title": "Project Templates and Initial Assumptions",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine project templates pre-configure various project settings and assets to streamline development for specific game genres or application types. These templates make assumptions about the project's intended use, influencing default configurations for rendering, input, and gameplay mechanics.",

      "concept": "While project templates provide a starting point, nearly all settings can be modified after project creation. Understanding the mutability of these settings is crucial for adapting the engine to specific project needs beyond the initial template's scope. This includes Render settings, project scalability, and default assets.",

      "concept": "Unreal Engine's default configurations, especially within templates, allow for rapid prototyping and immediate interaction. This is achieved through pre-configured Blueprints, Character Movement Components, and input mappings. Understanding these defaults is key to leveraging the engine's power for quick iteration.",
