Detail how actors are spawned into the world and the performance implications of different spawning methods (e.g., direct spawning vs. using a spawner actor).",

Explain how level streaming allows for modular loading and unloading of level content, improving performance and enabling large, seamless worlds. Discuss the different streaming methods (e.g., Blueprint-based, distance-based).",

      "procedural_step": "An Unreal Engine project is not made up of a single file, but rather a collection of source code, content assets, plugins, configuration files, and other support files.",
      "why": "Because Unreal Engine uses an asset management system. All assets are individually tracked and managed by the engine. This modularity allows for efficient packaging, version control, and reuse of content across different projects.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:30",
      "procedural_step": "We need a way to link all of these various things together and that's where levels come in.",
      "why": "Levels act as containers for actors and other assets, defining the spatial arrangement and relationships between them. Without levels, the engine wouldn't know where to place actors in the world or how to render them.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:43",
      "procedural_step": "Levels allow us to add or spawn actors.",
      "why": "The level defines the 'World' context. Actors cannot exist outside of a World. The Level also controls the physics simulation, rendering settings, and other global parameters that affect all actors within it.",

      "timestamp": "1:15",
      "procedural_step": "No matter what you are trying to display, you are always going to need some type of level in order to display that information.",
      "why": "Because the rendering pipeline and game logic are intrinsically tied to the level. The level provides the necessary context for the engine to render actors, process input, and execute game logic.",
