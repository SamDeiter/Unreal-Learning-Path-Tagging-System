      "title": "World Partition Fundamentals",
      "concept": "World Partition spatially divides a large world into manageable cells, enabling selective loading and unloading of actors based on player proximity. This contrasts with monolithic level design, where the entire world is loaded into memory regardless of the player's location.",

      "concept": "Hierarchical Level of Detail (HLOD) is a crucial component of World Partition. It automatically generates simplified versions of distant actors, reducing rendering cost. Understanding HLOD settings (e.g., transition screen size, mesh simplification) is key to optimizing performance without sacrificing visual fidelity.",
