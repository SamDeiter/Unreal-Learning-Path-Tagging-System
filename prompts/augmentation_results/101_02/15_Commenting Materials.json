      "concept": "Material Instances allow you to modify material properties without recompiling the base material. This is achieved by exposing parameters that can be overridden. The Material Editor compiles into HLSL shaders, which are executed on the GPU. Understanding the shader compilation process is crucial for performance optimization.",

While they don't affect performance, they enhance maintainability, especially in complex materials with many interconnected nodes. This reduces cognitive load when debugging or modifying the material.",
