      "title": "Material Shading Models",
      "concept": "The video immediately jumps into material creation without explaining the underlying shading models (e.g., Default Lit, Unlit, Subsurface) that dictate how the material interacts with light. Understanding these models is crucial for achieving desired visual effects.",

      "concept": "The video uses textures without explaining texture sampling, filtering, and mipmaps. These concepts are essential for understanding how textures are rendered at different distances and resolutions, impacting performance and visual quality.",

Material Instances inherit from a parent material and allow modification of specific parameters without recompiling the entire shader, saving significant time and resources.",

      "timestamp": "3:15",
      "procedural_step": "Converting to parameters.",
      "why": "Converting texture samples to parameters allows for dynamic modification of the material's appearance through Material Instances. This avoids recompiling the base material shader for each variation, saving significant time and resources, especially in large projects.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:37",
      "prompt": "Why is it more efficient to use parameters in a master material instead of directly assigning textures to every object?",
      "expected_insight": "Parameters allow for creating material instances, which share the same shader code but have different texture assignments. This reduces shader complexity and improves performance compared to creating unique materials for each object."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:04",
      "prompt": "Why does the normal map input show an error when a regular texture is connected?",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:54",
      "prompt": "What are the performance implications of using high-resolution textures in a material?",
      "expected_insight": "High-resolution textures consume more memory and bandwidth, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks, especially on lower-end hardware. Mipmaps mitigate this by providing lower-resolution versions of the texture for distant objects."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:00",
      "prompt": "How do material instances contribute to a non-destructive workflow?",
      "expected_insight": "Material instances allow for modifying material properties without altering the original parent material. This ensures that the base material remains consistent and reusable, preventing unintended changes from propagating throughout the project."
