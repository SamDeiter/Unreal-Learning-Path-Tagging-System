      "procedural_step": "Allow All Edits",
      "why": "Enabling 'Allow All Edits' grants unrestricted modification rights, which can be useful for rapid prototyping but poses a risk of unintended changes to core level assets, potentially leading to instability or data corruption if not carefully managed. This can impact collaborative workflows.",

Without it, animations can exhibit jarring pops or discontinuities, breaking the illusion of realistic movement. This directly impacts the perceived quality of the animation.",

      "why": "Using 'Absolute' transform tracks completely overrides existing transformations. While useful for resetting an actor's state, overuse can break animation chains and make it difficult to create layered or additive effects. This can lead to inflexible and difficult-to-maintain animation setups.",

This is crucial for creating corrective poses, secondary motion, and other subtle animation effects without completely redoing the base animation. This promotes modularity and reusability in animation workflows.",

      "timestamp": "4:01",
      "procedural_step": "Inverse Solve for Control Rig",
      "why": "Applying inverse kinematics (IK) solvers within Control Rig allows animators to manipulate end effectors (e.g., hands, feet) and have the rig automatically calculate the joint angles needed to achieve the desired pose. This simplifies complex animation tasks and allows for more intuitive control over character movement.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:55",
      "prompt": "Under what circumstances would the 'Relative' transform option be preferable to 'Absolute' or 'Additive'?",
      "expected_insight": "When you need to create animations that are dependent on the initial state and existing animations, but also require some degree of independent control. This allows for nuanced adjustments without completely overriding or simply adding to the existing animation."
