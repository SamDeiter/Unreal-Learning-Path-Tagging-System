      "title": "Landscape Material Blending via Alpha Masks",
      "concept": "The Landscape system leverages Material Instances and Texture Sample nodes within the Material Editor to blend different landscape layers based on alpha masks. These masks control the weight of each layer's contribution to the final rendered output.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing the flow of data from a Texture Sample node (representing the alpha mask) to a Lerp node that blends two Landscape Layer Sample nodes."

      "title": "Pattern Projection and UV Mapping",
      "concept": "Projecting patterns onto the landscape involves manipulating UV coordinates within the landscape material. The engine calculates the world-space position of each landscape component and uses this to sample the pattern texture. Understanding UV scaling and tiling is crucial for seamless pattern application.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of UV coordinate mapping on a landscape component, illustrating how a 2D texture is 'wrapped' onto the 3D surface."

      "title": "Brush Falloff and Interpolation",
      "concept": "Brush falloff determines how the sculpting effect attenuates from the center of the brush. Different falloff curves (linear, smooth, spherical) use different interpolation functions to control this attenuation. This directly impacts the smoothness and naturalness of the sculpted terrain.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A graph comparing different falloff curves (linear, smooth, spherical) showing how the sculpting strength changes with distance from the brush center."

      "why": "Using alpha brushes allows for non-destructive blending of landscape layers. The alpha channel controls the opacity of each layer, enabling the creation of complex and detailed terrain features without permanently altering the underlying heightmap data.",

      "procedural_step": "Selecting a pattern to project onto the landscape",
      "why": "Projecting patterns allows for the efficient creation of repetitive details like rock formations or ground textures. By adjusting the UV scaling and offset, you can seamlessly tile these patterns across the landscape, reducing the need for manual sculpting of each individual detail.",

    {
      "timestamp": "0:43",
      "procedural_step": "Storing masks in RGB and alpha channels",
      "why": "Packing multiple masks into a single texture optimizes memory usage and improves rendering performance. The engine can sample a single texture to retrieve multiple blending weights, reducing the number of texture lookups required per pixel.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:11",
      "procedural_step": "Adjusting brush falloff",
      "why": "Modifying the brush falloff influences the smoothness and naturalness of terrain transitions. A softer falloff creates gradual blends between different height levels, while a sharper falloff results in more abrupt changes. This directly impacts the perceived realism of the landscape.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:20",
      "prompt": "Why is it beneficial to use textures as masks instead of directly sculpting the landscape?",
      "expected_insight": "Textures as masks allow for non-destructive editing, easier iteration, and the ability to reuse patterns across different areas of the landscape. They also enable more complex blending effects than manual sculpting alone."
    },

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:48",
      "prompt": "How does the choice of brush type (clay vs. alpha) affect the final appearance of the sculpted terrain?",
      "expected_insight": "Clay brushes tend to create flatter surfaces, while alpha brushes can introduce more varied and detailed surface textures. The choice depends on the desired aesthetic and the type of terrain being created."

      "prompt": "Imagine you want to create a very smooth transition between two landscape heights. Which brush falloff setting would be most appropriate, and why?",
      "expected_insight": "A smooth or spherical falloff would be most appropriate, as it provides a gradual attenuation of the sculpting effect, resulting in a seamless blend between the two heights."
