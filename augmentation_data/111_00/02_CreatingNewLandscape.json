      "concept": "Landscape components are subdivided into quads, and the 'Section Size' determines the number of quads per component. Larger landscapes require careful management of Level of Detail (LOD) to maintain performance. The engine dynamically adjusts the complexity of distant landscape components, reducing the rendering cost. Understanding LOD bias settings is crucial for optimizing visual fidelity and performance.",

      "concept": "Landscapes often use complex materials with numerous textures and calculations. Unreal Engine utilizes material instancing to efficiently render these materials across the landscape. Understanding how material instances share data and reduce draw calls is essential for optimizing landscape rendering performance. Consider using Landscape Grass Type to instance foliage efficiently.",

      "why": "The section size directly impacts the resolution and detail of the landscape. Smaller sections create a denser mesh, allowing for finer details but increasing rendering cost. Larger sections reduce the mesh density, improving performance but sacrificing detail. This is a core trade-off managed by the Landscape system.",
