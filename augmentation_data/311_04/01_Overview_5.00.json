      "title": "World Composition vs. World Partition",
      "concept": "Explain the fundamental shift from World Composition in previous Unreal Engine versions to World Partition in UE5. World Composition relied on manual level streaming and had limitations in scalability for large open worlds. World Partition introduces an automated system for dividing the world into a grid of cells, enabling efficient loading and unloading of level instances based on player proximity and relevance. This system leverages the concepts of HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail) and data layers to optimize rendering and memory usage.",
