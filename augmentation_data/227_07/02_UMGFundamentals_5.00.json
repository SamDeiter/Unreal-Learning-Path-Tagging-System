      "title": "Understanding Scene Components",
      "concept": "Scene Components in Unreal Engine 5 act as the base class for all components that define the transform (location, rotation, scale) of an object in the world. They don't have any inherent visual representation but serve as attachment points and coordinate system providers for other components.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing the SceneComponent as the root of a component hierarchy, with examples of child components like StaticMeshComponent, PointLightComponent, and AudioComponent attached to it. Illustrate how the SceneComponent's transform affects the transforms of its children."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:50",
      "title": "Component Attachment and Hierarchy",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine uses a hierarchical component system. When a component is attached to another (parented), its transform becomes relative to the parent's transform. This allows for complex object arrangements and coordinated movement. Understanding the implications of this hierarchy is crucial for managing object behavior and performance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of a component hierarchy, demonstrating how changes to the root component's transform propagate down to child components. Show examples of how different attachment settings (e.g., Keep World Position, Keep Relative Position) affect the final transform of the child components."

      "timestamp": "1:05",
      "procedural_step": "Placing Spotlights on the Vehicle",
      "why": "Using movable spotlights requires Lumen to dynamically calculate global illumination. This impacts performance, especially with multiple lights. Consider using static or stationary lights with baked lighting for better performance if dynamic lighting isn't essential.",

      "timestamp": "2:37",
      "procedural_step": "Childing lights to the Light Holder",

    {
      "timestamp": "4:34",
      "procedural_step": "Adjusting Light Intensity",
      "why": "Increasing light intensity directly affects the energy emitted by the light source, influencing the overall brightness and contrast of the scene. Higher intensity values can significantly impact rendering performance, particularly with Lumen's global illumination calculations.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:48",
      "procedural_step": "Copying and Pasting Light Intensity Values",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:23",
      "prompt": "How does the choice between static, stationary, and movable lights impact the performance and visual fidelity of the scene, especially when using Lumen?",
      "expected_insight": "Static lights are the most performant but offer no dynamic lighting. Stationary lights allow for some dynamic shadows but require precomputed lighting. Movable lights offer full dynamic lighting but are the most expensive, especially with Lumen's global illumination."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:11",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to visually verify the lights toggling on and off before moving to the next section?",
