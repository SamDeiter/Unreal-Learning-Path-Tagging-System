      "title": "Editor-Only Modules",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine distinguishes between editor modules and runtime modules. Editor modules contain classes and functions that are only available within the Unreal Editor environment. This separation prevents shipping editor-specific code in the final game build, reducing package size and potential security vulnerabilities.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing the Unreal Engine architecture with clear separation between Editor Modules (e.g., EditorUtilityWidget) and Runtime Modules (e.g., GameplayAbility). Arrows indicate dependencies and data flow."

      "title": "Asset Import Pipeline",
      "concept": "The Unreal Engine's asset import pipeline allows developers to customize how assets are brought into the engine. This includes defining custom importers that can enforce naming conventions, validate data, and automatically configure assets based on project-specific rules. Using Python scripting, you can extend the import process to automate tasks such as LOD generation, material assignment, and collision setup.",

      "title": "Construction Script Execution Context",
      "concept": "The Construction Script executes within the Unreal Editor and during level initialization. It's crucial to understand that the Construction Script runs in a different context than the Event Graph. Heavy computations or blocking operations within the Construction Script can significantly impact editor performance and level loading times.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A comparison table highlighting the differences between Construction Script and Event Graph: Execution Time, Context, Use Cases, Performance Implications."

      "title": "Editor Tick vs. Game Tick",
      "concept": "The 'Tick' event in editor tools operates differently from the game's Tick event. While both execute periodically, the editor Tick can have a more direct and immediate impact on the editor's responsiveness. Overloading the editor Tick with complex calculations can lead to editor freezes and data loss. Consider using timers or asynchronous tasks for less critical operations.",

      "title": "Startup Actors",
      "concept": "Startup Actors are actors that are automatically spawned when the editor starts. They are useful for initializing editor-specific systems or performing setup tasks. However, excessive use of Startup Actors can increase editor startup time. It's important to carefully manage the number and complexity of Startup Actors to maintain a responsive editor experience.",

      "timestamp": "2:30",
      "procedural_step": "Tools automatically monitor things or identify issues.",

      "timestamp": "3:13",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:11",
      "prompt": "Why is automating repetitive tasks more important in large Unreal Engine projects compared to smaller ones?",
      "expected_insight": "In larger projects, the cumulative time saved by automating repetitive tasks becomes significant. It also reduces the likelihood of human error, which can have cascading effects across the project."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:16",
      "prompt": "How can a tool ensure accuracy in asset placement that a human might struggle with?",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:52",
      "prompt": "Why expose functions instead of directly modifying the actor's properties in the editor?",
      "expected_insight": "Exposing functions allows for more complex operations to be performed with a single click, encapsulating logic and preventing accidental modification of individual properties. It also provides a clear and controlled interface for interacting with the actor."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:12",
      "prompt": "Why is it more difficult to recover from a frozen editor than a frozen game?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:15",
      "prompt": "Why are actors a common asset for making tools?",
