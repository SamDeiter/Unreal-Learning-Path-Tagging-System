      "concept": "The Derived Data Cache (DDC) is a critical component of the Unreal Engine 5 asset pipeline. It stores pre-computed versions of assets optimized for different platforms and hardware configurations. Without a properly configured and understood DDC, iteration times can dramatically increase, and project scalability suffers due to redundant processing.",

      "concept": "The Stage Monitor and Level Snapshots are essential tools for collaborative virtual production workflows. The Stage Monitor provides a centralized view of the state of different levels and actors, while Level Snapshots allow for capturing and restoring specific level configurations. Understanding their capabilities is crucial for maintaining consistency and managing complexity in large virtual production projects.",
