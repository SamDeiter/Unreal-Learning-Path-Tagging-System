    {
      "timestamp": "1:19",
      "procedural_step": "Landscapes are divided into multiple components.",
      "why": "Because Unreal Engine uses components as the base unit for rendering, visibility, and collision calculations. Smaller components increase draw call count, impacting GPU performance. Larger components reduce draw calls but can decrease rendering fidelity at close range.",

    {
      "timestamp": "1:54",
      "procedural_step": "Components can be divided into subsections.",

      "timestamp": "2:27",

      "why": "The Z-scale directly affects the perceived height of the landscape. Incorrect scaling can lead to clipping issues, inaccurate physics interactions, and visual inconsistencies with other assets in the scene. The engine uses this value to map heightmap values to world-space coordinates.",

    {
      "timestamp": "3:17",
      "procedural_step": "Export heightmaps with 16-bit position.",
      "why": "Because Unreal Engine interprets heightmap data as 16-bit values. Using a different bit depth will result in incorrect height values, leading to distorted or flattened landscapes. This ensures compatibility with the engine's landscape rendering system.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:50",
      "procedural_step": "Use sizes from the recommended chart.",

      "prompt": "How would changing the Z scale of the landscape affect the way you design the rest of your level?",

      "expected_insight": "Failing to account for the underwater portion of the mountain will result in a compressed landscape, where the height differences are not accurately represented. This will impact the visual realism and potentially affect gameplay if the landscape is used for navigation or collision."
