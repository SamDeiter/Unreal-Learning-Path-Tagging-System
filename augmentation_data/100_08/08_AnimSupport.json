    {
      "timestamp": "1:09",
      "procedural_step": "Use Unreal ViewCam.",
      "why": "Unreal ViewCam allows for intuitive camera control within Unreal Engine by using the motion sensors of mobile devices. This provides a more natural and interactive way to frame shots and capture camera movements, as the camera's position and rotation are directly linked to the device's physical movements.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:31",
      "prompt": "How does streaming data directly from iOS devices into Unreal Engine using LiveLink Face improve the animation workflow? What are the limitations of this approach?",
      "expected_insight": "Direct streaming allows for real-time performance capture and animation, enabling animators to see the results of their actions immediately within the engine. However, it relies on the accuracy and stability of the tracking data from the iOS device, which can be affected by lighting conditions and device performance."

      "prompt": "Why is it important to understand how ViewCam transmits position and rotational data via LiveLink to drive the camera in real time? What are the potential performance implications?",
      "expected_insight": "Understanding the data transmission process allows users to troubleshoot issues and optimize the performance of ViewCam. Potential performance implications include network latency and processing overhead, which can affect the smoothness and responsiveness of the camera movement."
