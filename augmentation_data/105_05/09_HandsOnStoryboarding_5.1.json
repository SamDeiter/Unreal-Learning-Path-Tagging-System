      "timestamp": "1:54",
      "procedural_step": "Create a Camera Actor",
      "why": "Camera Actors define the viewpoint and perspective through which the scene is rendered. They encapsulate properties like focal length, aperture, and film back, which directly influence the final image. Incorrect camera settings can lead to performance bottlenecks if post processing effects are overused to compensate.",

      "procedural_step": "Adjust Background Alpha",
      "why": "Adjusting the background alpha allows for focusing attention on the drawings by reducing the visual complexity of the underlying scene. This can improve clarity and reduce cognitive load during the storyboarding process, especially in scenes with high visual density.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:43",
      "prompt": "Why is using Level Sequences better than directly manipulating actor transforms in the level viewport for cinematic creation?",
      "expected_insight": "Level Sequences offer a non-destructive, timeline-based approach, enabling iterative refinement and complex animation without permanently altering the base level. They also facilitate collaboration and version control."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:23",
      "prompt": "How does the Camera Actor's film back setting influence the final rendered image, and what are the performance implications of choosing different film back sizes?",
      "expected_insight": "The film back size affects the field of view and depth of field. Larger film backs create shallower depth of field, requiring more intensive post-processing, which can impact performance. Smaller film backs require less processing but may not achieve the desired cinematic look."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:46",
      "prompt": "Why is understanding temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) important when using onion skinning for rapid drawing changes?",
      "expected_insight": "TAA blends frames together to reduce aliasing, but this can cause ghosting or blurring artifacts when drawings change rapidly between frames. Understanding TAA's behavior allows for adjusting drawing speed and detail to minimize these artifacts."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:50",
      "prompt": "How does the Iliad plugin leverage Unreal Engine's rendering pipeline to display drawings directly on the camera plane?",
      "expected_insight": "The Iliad plugin likely uses a custom material and render target to project the drawings onto the camera plane. This allows the drawings to be integrated seamlessly into the scene without affecting the underlying geometry or lighting."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:00",
      "prompt": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of storyboarding directly within Unreal Engine compared to using traditional 2D storyboarding tools?",
      "expected_insight": "Storyboarding in UE5 allows for immediate visualization of shots within the actual environment, providing a more accurate representation of the final cinematic. However, it may require more technical expertise and resources compared to traditional methods."
