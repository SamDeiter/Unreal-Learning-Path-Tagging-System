      "why": "The Camera Cuts track dictates which camera's view is active at a given time. This is fundamental for creating a sequence of shots, as the engine switches rendering focus based on the active camera in this track. Without it, you cannot switch between different camera angles during playback.",

      "timestamp": "3:00",
      "procedural_step": "Creating Transform Keyframe",
      "why": "This records the camera's location, rotation, and scale at a specific time. The engine interpolates between these keyframes to create the camera's movement. Inefficient keyframing can lead to jerky or unnatural motion.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:05",
      "procedural_step": "Setting interpolation to Linear",
      "why": "Linear interpolation creates constant-speed motion between keyframes. While simple, it can appear unnatural for organic movements. Consider using Bezier or other interpolation types for smoother results.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:31",
      "prompt": "How does the placement of keyframes affect the perceived speed and smoothness of the camera animation?",
      "expected_insight": "Keyframe proximity dictates animation speed; closer keyframes result in faster motion. The interpolation between keyframes determines smoothness; linear interpolation creates constant speed, while Bezier interpolation allows for acceleration and deceleration."

      "prompt": "What are the trade-offs between using default ease-in/ease-out and linear interpolation for camera movements?",
      "expected_insight": "Ease-in/ease-out provides a more natural feel but requires fine-tuning. Linear interpolation is simpler but can appear robotic. The choice depends on the desired aesthetic and the complexity of the shot."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:13",
      "prompt": "How does the Curve Editor provide more control over animation than the basic interpolation settings in Sequencer?",
