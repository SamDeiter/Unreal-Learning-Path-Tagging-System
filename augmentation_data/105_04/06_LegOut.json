      "title": "Render Pipeline Overview",
      "concept": "The legacy output method bypasses much of the Unreal Engine's rendering pipeline, resulting in lower quality. MRQ leverages the full capabilities of the deferred rendering system, including post-processing effects, temporal anti-aliasing, and more accurate lighting calculations.",

      "title": "Anti-Aliasing Techniques",
      "concept": "The High Resolution Screenshot tool uses basic spatial anti-aliasing, which is less effective than the temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) available in the Movie Render Queue. TAA accumulates samples over multiple frames to produce a smoother image, especially important for animated content.",

      "title": "Codec Selection & Compression",
      "concept": "The legacy Movie Screen Capture tool offers limited codec options, impacting the final video quality and file size. Modern codecs in MRQ offer superior compression algorithms, allowing for smaller file sizes with minimal quality loss. Understanding codec differences is crucial for efficient cinematic workflows.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A table comparing different video codecs (e.g., H.264, H.265, ProRes) in terms of compression efficiency, quality, and compatibility."

    {
      "timestamp": "0:30",
      "procedural_step": "Use a legacy output.",

      "timestamp": "0:50",
      "procedural_step": "Use the Viewport menu to access the High Resolution Screenshot option.",
      "why": "This method directly captures the viewport buffer, scaling it up. It's a simple way to get a higher resolution image, but it's limited by the viewport's rendering settings and lacks advanced rendering features.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:00",
      "procedural_step": "Non-renderable icons are saved as part of the image.",
      "why": "Because the High Resolution Screenshot tool captures the viewport directly, any UI elements or editor icons present in the viewport will be included in the final image. This is because they are part of the final buffer being rendered to the screen.",
