      "concept": "The Metahuman Identity pipeline leverages a combination of photogrammetry, 3D scanning, and machine learning to create realistic digital humans. Understanding the underlying algorithms and data structures involved in facial reconstruction and rigging is crucial for advanced customization and troubleshooting.",

      "title": "DNA Calibration in Metahumans",
      "concept": "The 'embedded DNA' refers to a set of parameters that control the shape and behavior of the Metahuman. This DNA is a high-dimensional vector that drives blend shapes and skeletal deformations. Understanding how to manipulate this DNA directly allows for precise control over character appearance and animation.",

      "title": "Region Influence Blending",
      "concept": "The region influence slider in Metahuman Creator adjusts the weighting between the input mesh and a template Metahuman. This blending process uses a Laplacian surface editing technique to smoothly deform the template mesh towards the shape of the input. Understanding the mathematical basis of this technique allows for more effective refinement of problematic areas.",
