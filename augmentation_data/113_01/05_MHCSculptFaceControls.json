      "title": "Understanding Inverse Kinematics (IK) in Facial Animation",
      "concept": "The Sculpt tool leverages IK principles. IK solves for joint angles to achieve a desired end-effector position. In this case, the 'end effector' is the sculpt marker, and the 'joints' are the underlying facial rig controls. Understanding how IK solvers work (e.g., FABRIK) is crucial for predicting the behavior of the Sculpt tool.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing a simplified facial rig with joints and an IK solver targeting a sculpt marker. Highlight how moving the marker influences the joint angles."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:21",
      "title": "Dynamic Maps and Facial Expressions",
      "concept": "The 'texture' slider affects dynamic maps. Dynamic maps, such as normal maps and displacement maps, are textures that change based on animation or other runtime factors. In the context of MetaHumans, these maps are likely driven by the facial rig and animation system to create realistic wrinkles and skin deformation during expressions. Understanding Material Instances and Parameter Collections is key to controlling these dynamic effects.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating how a facial animation (e.g., a smile) drives changes in a dynamic normal map, which in turn affects the surface appearance of the skin."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:02",
      "title": "Statistical Morphable Models (SMPL) and Facial Feature Approximation",
      "concept": "The Sculpt and Move tools rely on a statistical morphable model (SMPL). SMPL is a 3D model of human body shape learned from a large dataset of 3D scans. The engine approximates sculpting changes by finding the closest combination of facial features within the SMPL space. This is a form of data-driven animation. Understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear blend skinning (LBS) is helpful for understanding the limitations of this approach.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating the concept of a morphable model, showing how different facial features (e.g., nose shape, eye position) can be blended together to create new variations."

      "why": "Render quality settings directly impact performance. High settings (e.g., ray tracing) increase visual fidelity but can significantly reduce frame rates, especially on lower-end hardware. Understanding scalability settings and level-of-detail (LOD) management is crucial for optimizing performance.",

      "timestamp": "3:07",
      "procedural_step": "Blend per region",
      "why": "Region-based blending allows for localized control over facial features. This is important because different regions of the face contribute differently to overall expression and identity. Overlapping influences can create unexpected results if not carefully managed.",

      "procedural_step": "Control texture slider",

      "timestamp": "8:42",
      "procedural_step": "Adjust Iris size",

      "prompt": "Why might blending between more than three MetaHuman presets become computationally expensive?",

      "prompt": "Why is it important to understand the underlying color space (e.g., sRGB, Linear) when adjusting skin tones?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "9:49",
      "prompt": "How might subtle variations in tooth color and plaque amount contribute to a character's personality or backstory?",
