      "title": "Understanding IK Rig Constraint Evaluation Order",
      "concept": "IK Rigs in Unreal Engine 5 solve constraints iteratively. The order in which constraints are evaluated impacts the final pose. Cyclic dependencies can lead to unpredictable results. The Retarget Post From Mesh node relies on a correctly configured IK Rig to produce plausible poses.",

      "concept": "MetaHuman facial animation leverages a blendshape-based system driven by control curves. Live Link Face, MetaHuman Animator, and Audio-Driven Animation all feed into this system, manipulating blendshape weights to achieve realistic expressions. Understanding the underlying blendshape topology is crucial for advanced customization.",

      "why": "Retargeting remaps the animation data from a source skeleton to a target skeleton. This process involves solving for joint rotations and translations on the target skeleton that best approximate the motion of the source skeleton. Incorrect bone mapping will lead to animation artifacts.",

      "why": "The shared skeleton allows for seamless animation transfer and asset reuse across different MetaHuman characters. This reduces development time and promotes consistency in animation quality. However, it also means that any skeletal changes must be carefully considered to avoid breaking existing animations.",

      "prompt": "Why does the engine prompt for skeleton assignment when importing animation assets?",
