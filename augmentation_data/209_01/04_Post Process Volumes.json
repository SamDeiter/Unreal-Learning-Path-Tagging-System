      "title": "Understanding Exposure Value (EV100)",
      "concept": "EV100 represents a combination of shutter speed and aperture that results in a specific luminance. Clamping EV100 in the post-process volume limits the automatic exposure range, preventing extreme brightness or darkness in the final render. This directly impacts the perceived dynamic range and artistic intent of the scene.",

      "concept": "The procedural diaphragm simulation in UE5's cinematic depth of field calculates the bokeh shape based on the number of diaphragm blades. This affects the aesthetic quality of out-of-focus areas. Understanding how the number of blades influences the bokeh allows for artistic control over the image.",

      "concept": "The Path Tracer's handling of translucency depth is crucial for accurate depth of field rendering. Enabling 'Reference Depth of Field' corrects legacy issues where translucent materials wouldn't contribute to the depth buffer, leading to incorrect blurring. This ensures physically accurate rendering of translucent objects within the scene's depth of field.",

      "procedural_step": "Controlling diaphragm blades",
      "why": "The number of diaphragm blades directly influences the shape of the bokeh in out-of-focus areas. More blades create a more circular bokeh, while fewer blades create polygonal shapes. This artistic choice impacts the overall aesthetic and perceived realism of the depth of field effect.",

    {
      "timestamp": "1:38",
      "procedural_step": "Aperture doesn't control light intensity",
      "why": "Decoupling aperture from light intensity allows for independent control over depth of field and exposure. If aperture directly controlled light, adjusting depth of field would require constant exposure compensation, making it difficult to achieve the desired artistic effect.",
