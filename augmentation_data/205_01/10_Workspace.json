      "title": "Viewport Rendering Pipelines",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine 5 uses different rendering pipelines for the main viewport and cinematic previews. The default viewport uses a real-time rendering pipeline optimized for interactivity, while the cinematic viewport leverages higher quality settings and post-processing effects for final output. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate previewing.",
