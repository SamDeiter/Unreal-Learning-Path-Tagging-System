      "why": "Activating camera tracking ensures that the virtual camera's position and orientation are continuously updated based on the tracking system's data. Failing to do so results in a static virtual camera, which will not match the physical camera's movements, leading to visual discrepancies and a broken sense of immersion.",

An incorrect origin point will cause misalignment between the real and virtual worlds, leading to parallax errors and a compromised final image.",
