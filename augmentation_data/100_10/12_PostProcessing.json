Incorrect priority can lead to unintended visual results or the complete masking of certain effects.",

Understanding how it interacts with auto-exposure is crucial for achieving consistent and visually appealing lighting across different environments. Incorrect exposure settings can lead to blown-out highlights or crushed shadows.",
