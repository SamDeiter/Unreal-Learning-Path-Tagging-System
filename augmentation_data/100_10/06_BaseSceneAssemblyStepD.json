      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:36",
      "title": "Cube Map Source Types",
      "concept": "The Skylight's 'Source Type' property determines how it generates ambient light. 'SLS Captured Scene' dynamically captures the scene, while 'SLS Specified Cube Map' uses a pre-existing environment map for controlled lighting.",

      "procedural_step": "Increasing Cube Map Resolution",
      "why": "Increasing the cube map resolution improves the fidelity of reflections and indirect lighting, resulting in more realistic visuals. However, higher resolutions consume more memory and increase rendering time, impacting performance. A balance must be struck between visual quality and performance.",

    {
      "timestamp": "5:22",
      "procedural_step": "Disabling 'Lower Hemisphere is Solid Color'",
      "why": "Disabling 'Lower Hemisphere is Solid Color' allows the entire cube map to contribute to the ambient lighting, resulting in more accurate and immersive visuals. Enabling it discards the lower hemisphere data, leading to a less realistic lighting environment.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:48",
      "prompt": "How does the choice of cube map affect the overall mood and feel of the scene?",
      "expected_insight": "The cube map defines the environment reflected in the scene, influencing the color palette, brightness, and overall atmosphere. A warm-toned cube map will create a more inviting scene, while a cool-toned one will create a more sterile or technical environment."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:27",
      "prompt": "Why is a desaturated HDRI preferred for creating a neutralized baseline?",
      "expected_insight": "A desaturated HDRI minimizes color bias in the ambient lighting, allowing for more accurate color grading and material representation. It provides a neutral foundation upon which to build the desired lighting effects."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:41",
      "prompt": "How does the intensity of the Skylight interact with other light sources in the scene?",
      "expected_insight": "The Skylight provides the base level of ambient lighting, while other light sources add direct illumination and highlights. The intensity of the Skylight must be balanced with the other lights to achieve a realistic and visually appealing result. Overpowering the Skylight can wash out the scene, while underpowering it can lead to overly dark shadows."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:34",
      "prompt": "What are the potential drawbacks of disabling 'Lower Hemisphere is Solid Color'?",
      "expected_insight": "Disabling 'Lower Hemisphere is Solid Color' can introduce unwanted artifacts or inconsistencies in the lighting if the lower hemisphere of the cube map contains irrelevant or undesirable information. It's important to carefully select a cube map that is appropriate for the scene and lighting goals."
