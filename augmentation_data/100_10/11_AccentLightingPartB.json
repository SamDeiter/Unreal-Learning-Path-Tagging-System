      "title": "Inverse Square Law & AttenuationRadius",
      "concept": "The AttenuationRadius property of a Point Light directly influences the light's falloff based on the inverse square law. Understanding this relationship is crucial for controlling light intensity and preventing unrealistic lighting scenarios. The engine calculates light contribution based on distance and this radius.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating the inverse square law, showing how light intensity decreases with distance from the light source, with AttenuationRadius visualized as a sphere of influence."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:33",
      "title": "Specular Lighting Model",
      "concept": "The Specular Scale property modifies the contribution of the specular component in the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) lighting model. Lowering this value reduces the intensity of specular highlights, creating a more diffuse appearance. This directly affects how surfaces reflect light based on material properties and light direction.",

    {
      "timestamp": "0:21",
      "procedural_step": "Don't use too many lights",
      "why": "Each light adds to the rendering cost. Overlapping lights increase shader complexity, impacting performance, especially with Lumen's global illumination calculations. Too many high intensity lights can also cause overexposure and visual artifacts.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:49",
      "procedural_step": "Setting attenuation radius low",
      "why": "A smaller AttenuationRadius limits the light's influence, reducing the number of pixels the engine needs to shade for that light. This improves performance, especially on complex scenes with many lights. It also allows for localized highlights without washing out the entire scene.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:00",
      "procedural_step": "Switching light to Movable",
      "why": "Movable lights are dynamically lit every frame, allowing for real-time changes. However, they are more expensive than static or stationary lights. Choosing Movable is necessary for dynamic lighting effects, but it increases the rendering cost per frame.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:34",
      "procedural_step": "Dropping specular scale",
      "why": "Reducing the specular scale decreases the intensity of specular highlights. This affects the material's BRDF, making it appear more diffuse. This can improve visual clarity by reducing distracting highlights and focusing attention on the object's form.",

    {

      "prompt": "Why is the attenuation radius crucial for both visual aesthetics AND performance?",
      "expected_insight": "A smaller radius limits the light's reach, reducing the number of pixels the engine needs to calculate, thus improving performance. It also allows for more controlled and localized highlights."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:22",
      "prompt": "How does the intensity of a light source interact with the attenuation radius to affect the overall scene lighting?",
      "expected_insight": "Intensity determines the raw power of the light, while the attenuation radius defines how far that power extends. A high intensity with a small radius creates a focused, bright spot, while a lower intensity with a larger radius creates a softer, more diffused light."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:03",
      "prompt": "Why does reducing the specular scale create a more 'diffuse' look, and what are the trade-offs?",
      "expected_insight": "Specular highlights are reflections of the light source. Reducing the specular scale diminishes these reflections, making the surface appear less shiny and more matte. The tradeoff is a less realistic material appearance, but potentially better focus on the object's shape."
