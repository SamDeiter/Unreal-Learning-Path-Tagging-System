      "title": "Path Tracer Convergence and Sampling",
      "concept": "Path Tracer relies on Monte Carlo integration. Understanding convergence (how quickly the noise disappears) is crucial. Adjusting CVars affects sample counts and thus, convergence rate. Inadequate samples lead to noisy renders, while excessive samples increase render time exponentially.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A graph showing noise level decreasing as sample count increases, with diminishing returns after a certain point."

      "title": "Post-Process Material Buffers and Compositing",
      "concept": "Post-process materials operate on the rendered image *after* the Path Tracer has finished its calculations. They allow for non-physical effects and artistic adjustments without re-rendering the entire scene. Understanding the available buffers (e.g., BaseColor, Normal, Depth) is essential for targeted adjustments.",

      "concept": "Path Tracer uses importance sampling to focus computational effort on light paths that contribute most to the final image. Understanding different sampling techniques (e.g., direct lighting, next event estimation) and their impact on artifact reduction is key to optimizing render quality.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual comparison of uniform sampling vs. importance sampling, showing how importance sampling reduces noise in brightly lit areas."

      "timestamp": "0:23",
      "procedural_step": "Reduce visual artifacts",

      "timestamp": "0:27",
      "procedural_step": "Tweaking rendering and lighting settings",
      "why": "Lighting settings, such as light source intensity and radius, directly impact the Path Tracer's convergence rate. Overly bright or small light sources can create challenging sampling scenarios, leading to increased noise and render times. Optimizing lighting setups is crucial for efficient path tracing.",

      "expected_insight": "Increasing samples reduces noise but increases render time linearly. There's a point of diminishing returns where the improvement in image quality is negligible compared to the added render time. Understanding this trade-off is crucial for optimization."
