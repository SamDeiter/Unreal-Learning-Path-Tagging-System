      "title": "Lumen Global Illumination",
      "concept": "Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system. It reacts to scene and light changes in real-time, eliminating the need for baked lighting in many scenarios. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is crucial for efficient lighting design.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating the Lumen pipeline: tracing rays, surface cache, software ray tracing, and final gather."

      "title": "Exposure Control in UE5",
      "concept": "Exposure in UE5 simulates the behavior of a camera's aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. It determines the overall brightness of the scene. Auto Exposure dynamically adjusts these settings based on the scene's luminance, while manual control offers precise artistic control.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of the exposure triangle (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) and their impact on image brightness and depth of field."

      "title": "Reflection System",
      "concept": "UE5 offers multiple reflection techniques, including Screen Space Reflections (SSR), Lumen Reflections, and Reflection Probes. SSR is cost-effective but limited to visible surfaces. Lumen Reflections provide more accurate reflections but can be computationally expensive. Reflection Probes capture static reflections for specific areas.",

      "procedural_step": "Discussing Direct and Indirect Lighting",
      "why": "Understanding the distinction between direct and indirect lighting is crucial because Lumen handles them differently. Direct lighting contributes to the initial illumination, while indirect lighting (bounces) is calculated by Lumen's global illumination system, impacting performance and visual fidelity.",

      "timestamp": "0:21",
      "procedural_step": "Controlling Exposure",
      "why": "Controlling exposure is essential because it directly affects the perceived brightness and contrast of the scene. Incorrect exposure can lead to blown-out highlights or crushed shadows, obscuring details and impacting the overall mood. Auto Exposure can be unpredictable; manual control offers artistic precision.",

      "procedural_step": "Optimizing Reflections",
      "why": "Optimizing reflections is important because they can significantly impact rendering performance. Using high-resolution reflection captures or excessive Lumen reflection samples can lead to frame rate drops. Balancing visual quality with performance is key, especially in large architectural scenes.",
