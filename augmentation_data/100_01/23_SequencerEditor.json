      "concept": "Sequencer's keyframing system is built on the concept of 'tracks' that store animation data for specific properties of actors. The engine interpolates between keyframes using various easing functions, allowing for precise control over animation curves. This system is deeply integrated with the engine's object property system (UProperty).",
