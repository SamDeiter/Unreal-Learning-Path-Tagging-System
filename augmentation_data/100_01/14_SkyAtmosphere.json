      "title": "Atmospheric Scattering Theory",
      "concept": "The Sky Atmosphere actor simulates atmospheric scattering, a phenomenon where light interacts with particles in the atmosphere, causing it to change direction and color. This is governed by Mie and Rayleigh scattering principles, affecting the color of the sky and the appearance of distant objects.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating Rayleigh and Mie scattering, showing how different wavelengths of light are scattered by particles of different sizes in the atmosphere."

      "title": "Directional Light and Sky Lighting",
      "concept": "The Sky Atmosphere actor integrates with the Directional Light (simulating the sun) and the Sky Light to create realistic lighting. The Directional Light's position and intensity directly influence the atmospheric scattering, while the Sky Light provides ambient lighting based on the sky's appearance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing the interaction between the Directional Light, Sky Light, Sky Atmosphere, and Exponential Height Fog, illustrating how they contribute to the overall scene lighting."

      "procedural_step": "Configuring the Sky Atmosphere actor",
      "why": "Adjusting parameters like atmosphere height and scattering coefficients directly affects the volumetric rendering calculations performed by the engine. These calculations determine how light is scattered and absorbed, impacting the final color and appearance of the sky and distant objects. Incorrect settings can lead to unrealistic or visually unappealing results.",

    {
      "timestamp": "1:25",
      "procedural_step": "Sky Atmosphere works with Directional Light and Skylight",
      "why": "The Sky Atmosphere component dynamically updates based on the Directional Light's position. This is because the engine uses the light's direction to calculate the angle of incidence on atmospheric particles, influencing the intensity and color of scattered light. The Skylight captures the ambient light from the sky, contributing to the overall scene illumination. Discrepancies between these light sources can cause visual artifacts.",

    {
      "timestamp": "1:54",
      "procedural_step": "Adjusting the directional light affects the sky atmosphere",
      "why": "The Sky Atmosphere's appearance is directly tied to the Directional Light's position because the engine simulates the sun's rays passing through the atmosphere. The angle at which the light hits the atmosphere affects the amount of scattering, which in turn changes the sky's color and intensity. This is crucial for creating realistic day/night cycles and atmospheric effects.",

      "prompt": "How does the Sky Atmosphere actor contribute to the overall sense of scale and distance in a scene?",
