      "concept": "Power-of-two textures are essential for efficient mipmap generation and texture streaming. Mipmaps are pre-calculated, lower-resolution versions of a texture used at different distances from the camera. Non-power-of-two textures can lead to wasted memory and increased GPU processing due to less efficient mipmap creation.",

Understanding the trade-offs between different formats is crucial for optimizing the rendering pipeline. For example, using uncompressed formats like BMP or TGA will consume significantly more memory and bandwidth.",

It's crucial to check the asset's quality, complexity, and licensing terms before integrating it into your project."
