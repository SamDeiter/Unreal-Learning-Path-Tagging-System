      "title": "Understanding the Fab Marketplace Architecture",
      "concept": "Fab is Epic's content distribution platform, integrated directly into the UE5 editor. It leverages the Epic Online Services (EOS) backend for authentication, licensing, and content delivery. Understanding its connection to EOS is crucial for managing dependencies and project portability.",

      "title": "Content Browser Asset Management",
      "concept": "The Content Browser in UE5 is not just a file explorer; it's a database-driven asset management system. When you add content from Fab, it's imported into the project's Content folder and registered in the Asset Registry. This registry is critical for efficient asset loading, referencing, and cooking during packaging.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:10",
      "procedural_step": "Using the asset in the project.",
      "why": "Once an asset is in the Content Browser, it can be dragged into the level viewport or referenced in Blueprints/Python scripts. The engine handles asset streaming and memory management automatically, but inefficient asset usage can still lead to performance bottlenecks.",

      "expected_insight": "The Asset Registry tracks all assets used in the project, including those from Fab. During packaging, the engine uses this registry to determine which assets to include in the final build. Incorrectly managed assets can lead to missing dependencies or bloated package sizes."
