      "concept": "Explain the underlying data structure of a Level Sequence. It's not just a timeline; it's a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent actors, properties, and events, and edges represent dependencies and time relationships. Understanding this DAG is crucial for optimization and advanced manipulation.",

      "concept": "Elaborate on how the Shot Track leverages the MovieScene underneath. Explain how it's not merely a container for camera cuts, but a powerful mechanism for orchestrating complex sub-sequences, triggering events, and managing actor states across multiple shots. Connect this to the larger concept of cinematic orchestration within UE5.",
