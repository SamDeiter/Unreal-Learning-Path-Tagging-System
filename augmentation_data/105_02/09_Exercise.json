    {
      "timestamp": "0:12",
      "procedural_step": "Binding cameras to the Level Sequence",
      "why": "Without a Camera Cuts track, the Sequencer does not know which UCameraComponent to use for rendering, resulting in either a black screen or the default perspective view. This binding is essential for directing the final output.",

      "timestamp": "0:20",

      "timestamp": "4:05",
      "procedural_step": "Removing the Control Rig",
      "why": "Animation Sequences and Control Rigs both drive skeletal mesh transforms. If both are active, the Control Rig will override the Animation Sequence, preventing the desired animation from playing. Muting or removing the Control Rig ensures the Animation Sequence takes precedence.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:07",
      "procedural_step": "Zeroing out actor transformations",
      "why": "Animation sequences often contain baked-in root motion. If the sequence was authored with an offset, the character will appear displaced when added to the level. Zeroing out the actor's transform resets its position to the origin, allowing the animation's relative motion to take effect from the desired starting point.",

      "timestamp": "6:38",
      "procedural_step": "Duplicating shots",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:34",
      "prompt": "Why is Sequencer referred to as a 'non-linear editor' in this context?",
      "expected_insight": "Unlike traditional linear video editing, Sequencer allows you to rearrange shots in any order without affecting the underlying animation data. This provides flexibility and enables rapid iteration on the final sequence."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:58",
      "prompt": "What is the relationship between a CineCameraActor and the Camera Cuts track?",
      "expected_insight": "The Camera Cuts track acts as a binding between a specific CineCameraActor in the level and the rendered output of the sequence. It tells Sequencer which camera's view to use at any given time."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:20",
      "prompt": "Why is it necessary to convert the SK_Mannequin to a 'spawnable'?",
      "expected_insight": "Converting to spawnable ensures that the actor is instanced specifically for the sequence, preventing unintended modifications to the original actor in the level and ensuring clean, predictable behavior within the sequence."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:26",
      "prompt": "What happens if the Camera Cuts track does NOT run the length of the entire shot?",
      "expected_insight": "If the Camera Cuts track is shorter than the shot, the render will revert to the default perspective after the Camera Cuts track ends, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect shot."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "9:10",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to review the sequence by clicking the camera icon on the shot track?",
      "expected_insight": "Clicking the camera icon ensures that you are viewing the sequence through the designated cameras for each shot, allowing you to accurately assess the pacing, composition, and overall flow of the sequence."

    {
      "timestamp": "3:19",
