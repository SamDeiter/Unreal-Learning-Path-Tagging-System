      "expected_insight": "Each channel controls a specific aspect of light interaction. Albedo defines the base color, Normal affects surface detail, Roughness controls specular highlights, and Metallic determines if the surface is metallic or non-metallic. Combining these correctly creates realistic surfaces."

Optimizations such as using simpler material graphs, reducing the number of animated parameters, and using material parameter collections can help mitigate these issues."
