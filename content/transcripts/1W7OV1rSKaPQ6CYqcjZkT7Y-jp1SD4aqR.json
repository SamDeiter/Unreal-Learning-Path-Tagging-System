Let's go ahead and do this by popping over to the editor. Then we're going to come to our particle update and hit the plus sign. Then we're going to look for sub-UV animation. We just click that and that's literally all that we need to do. Once we have put that on there, and there is one other thing we should probably do, is we have this object warning here. This is a really easy fix if you get this. It's a sprite renderer set to none. We just need to set this to the sprite renderer. That will fix itself. Let's just compile and save real quick. Now what's going to happen, and this is a very subtle effect, so it might be a little difficult to make out, but the smoke is actually going to be moving a little bit. It's going to be playing that frame by frame animation. The effect itself is relatively subtle. Again, we don't want anything that's too abrupt. We want something that's very subtle because this is going to build on with the lighting and everything like that. It's all going to come together to give us this really cool looking lit smoke.",
