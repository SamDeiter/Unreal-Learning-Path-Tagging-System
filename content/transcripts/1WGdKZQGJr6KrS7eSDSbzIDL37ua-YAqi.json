  "text": " All right, before we hop into the engine, we're going to cover the animation pipelines from traditional to more of the modern with Unreal Engine. So normally you would start in your separate DCC program, and you'd model, rig, and animate. And then once you were finished, you'd import that finished animation directly into Unreal Engine. Now you could take it further into Sequencer, edit things, add some more tracks to it, from whatever you would want for other reason. Now, you could also now edit in Sequencer, the option. You would edit with the FK control rig, or even bake it to an existing control rig, and work on that even further. Now here's a typical animation studio pipeline. As you can see, this is very traditional. You've got everything set up in the different departments that work alongside, kind of in parallel, and the very typical setup. Now the newer in-editor animation pipeline encourages you to do more within the engine, and as we add more and more tools, you're going to realize you're going to be able to do just about everything within Unreal Engine. Now currently you have the control rig and procedural rigging, which is a newer toolset, where you can build and animate controls either manually or using procedural rigging, as it says as a template. That means you can actually use that for multiple types of characters, different sizes, different bones, or the number of bones. It's a really great tool, but this is a new set of tool sets that have been added. Control rig's been around for a little while, but it's improving constantly. Now we also have the Sequencer key frame, where everything in the control rig is animated within the level sequence. You build an empty level, has the states, and you would work that area and animate it directly within that scene, all in live, in real time, so you'd be able to see what's going on as you're animating. You don't have to render it out first. There are some newer tools I did want to mention that currently they are within experimental stage. One of them is the Skeleton Mesh Editing Tool. This is available via a plugin, as it states. It is experimental, so it's not production ready. You'd suggest not using it. However, here is a link that is included for that U.S. Skeleton Editing. Now here is the newer pipeline. As you can see, there's some different coloring, which means it's traditionally done outside of Unreal and moving more as you see the colors are becoming darker. That means it's even more done so within the engine. So this is a pretty typical new studio pipeline utilizing everything within Unreal Engine.",
