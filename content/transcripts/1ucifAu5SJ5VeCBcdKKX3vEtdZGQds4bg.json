  "text": " Ray tracing can sometimes be tricky, so here are some additional tips. Make sure all lights that are static and stationary are set under the light mass settings of each light to Aver shadows. This helps if we are using both raytrace and backlight combos. Each light should be set to cast raytrace shadows by default, but as we said before, the skylight does not currently have this on by default. Console commands can be used with blueprints to help optimize visuals. Higher pulses can help with noise, but be careful as it can help some areas but can cause pixelation in others. Keep in mind that raytracing is always evolving. You can also try setting our raytracing reflection, reflection captures, to 1. This is very useful to fake a second bounce and keep the raytracing reflection bounce to 1. If you are considering raytrace global illumination, you should know that geometry with small holes or loads of little details can impact performance, such as fallout and fences. Indoor environments have worse performance than outdoors as areas that are directly lit is faster than indirect lighting. Also, more raytracing features are probably being used in interior environments such as reflections and translucency. We will see an example in the editor afterwards. Remember that if raytracing global illumination is very expensive for your scene, you can switch to screen space global illumination with raytracing reflections. This will greatly increase your performance. If we go to the level that ends with C-bars, we will be able to see some notes here talking about interior and exteriors. So basically it says that interiors are more expensive than exteriors as we just said. This is because more raytracing features are getting activated or being computed while we are in interiors than exteriors. So here we can see that we have the post-process volume that is covering all the area that we are watching. But if I just focus the sky, of course, we have very little things to render. If I just go into the exterior, we can see that the frame rate goes into between 25 and 30. But if I just get inside the interior, we can even have values lower than 10. So we have some recommendations here. When making interiors, be aware of items such as small geometry, as we have already explained. Bouncing geometry when needed can help. Then keeping materials not too complex with roughness can also help. So we have some other tips that we will see and later on we will enter the C-bars. But that will be in the next slide. So foliage can be tricky and there are many photons that are calculated. So be careful with that. And when using displacement shadows, they may be inaccurate. So bounds will need to be increased in geometry and there may be some occurrences in some shadows. So let's go back to the slides. Regarding optimization and performance, in order to get the best quality but still decent frame rate, you can do some of the following. You can reduce the screen percentage to 25 and if it's still too blurry, increase it to 50. Enabling material sorting may improve the cost of shading the reflected surfaces. Basically, material sorting shorts reflection shading and works by material coherence. This comes with some cost overhead. So material shading, it's only a win when shading coherence is limited. Gains around 50% are not uncommon. Only values of 1 and 0 are allowed as you can activate it or deactivate it respectively. You can activate screen space reflections after a particular distance with a hybrid approach when this command over here is enabled. Remember that a value of 1 will enable any commands. As we know, reflections are expensive and you can use the last bounds with reflection captures using this other command. If we go back to our scene, we're going to read the point number five. It says use leveled blueprint to help manage C bars. So if you want to immediately see the result, instead of going to the leveled blueprint, we're going to open the output block that is under the Windows tab and under the Windows drop list here. We can go into developer tools and then output block. We will be able to enter here the commands. So right now if I just click up a sign and already entered its value, I'm going to change raytraced global illumination screen percentage into 50. And now I get a better quality than having 25, but I can see that it still has a low frame rate. So if I just go here and instead of 50, I put 25, I can see that I have improved a lot my performance. So with all these commands, if I just close the editor and then I run the project again and I start the project again, they will be lost. But as we want everything to be in play mode, and even if we are going to render, when we render everything is in real time and it's like if the play was executed, we're going to go into the leveled blueprint. With that, we will go under in the top ribbon, we'll go under Blueprints, Open Level Blueprint. In this case, if we write execute command, also command, we will be able to just copy the command. So right now I'm going to just come here, get all of this and then copy it here. So I will just need to say when the game starts or even begin play, just execute this. So right now we will be able to see that if I have a value of 50, I get around 10, 12 per second in this part of the interior. But if I just hit play and I go back to this section, I will have a 25 screen percentage value. And this is because I executed that command in the leveled blueprint. So we can play with the screen percentage, also with source materials as we mentioned before, with hybrid reflection modes, and also with max ray distance. Remember that after configuring all your settings, if noise persists, you can always use brute force and global illumination. Just keep in mind the cost per frame as you increase samples. A general tip of our best practice is to reduce the number of bounces whenever possible, as you may not have proportional improvement in your visuals related to the cost. We can see an example here. If your card is timing out, please go to this link and follow the steps. This will avoid crashing. As for lighting, editing and sample recommendations, set your skylight resolution to 1024. Remember that you can modify the samples per picture per light, so try with low values first and then dial up based on your scene. Try always to balance between performance and visual fidelity, trying to avoid some noise. The higher your ray tree sample, less noise and slower performance. One is a good starting point, but higher values might have limited results. You can always start with final gathered settings, and then go to brute force if needed, or finally to render. Remember that more samples per pixel, less noise, but it will cost some performance. When you use final gather, it is based on a world distance measured from the original shading point. This rejection criteria defaults to 10 units. Any additional max bounces between one are silently discarded, and if you want to increase the value, do it by powers of 2. To avoid surprising temporal ghosting artifacts, you can use the following command to modify the workspace rejection criteria. For any additional information, please refer to this link.",
