  "text": " And then it's on to post-processing, which essentially means just making it look pretty. So we're going to use layered post-process volumes. We can layer post-process volumes using priority weighting, and we can always override low priority post-process volumes. So we're going to add a new post-process volume to the scene. We're going to set the priority to one. We're going to make sure, I always type unbound and set it infinite extent, but you want to make sure unbound is checked, which essentially populates it through the entire scene. So yeah, let's jump into the editor and create one of those now. So we will go to the post-process, post-process, load that there. So we're going to type unbound, check that, and then just make sure that priority is set to one. So this one will be almost like the master post-process that we'll be using. And so I just want to jump into a few settings that might be useful when editing your scenes. You could set the bloom intensity and threshold, maybe some chromatic aberrations, some lens flare in if you want, maybe some color grading. And these are all properties that you can find in the post-process and you can just type the relevant settings and just have a play around. These are some properties that we think look pretty good. But again, this is based on your personal preference. And again, it's the customization of the scene and how you think it should look. So just to give you a quick run through, I'm going to go to bloom. I'm going to set intensity. I'll set intensity to 0.01. Threshold is going to be one. And chromatic aberration is going to be 1.5. And then I've just pressed, you can press tab on the keyboard to cycle through options. I'm just going to go to 0.8 on the start offset. Going to go to lens flare. Lens flares. Intensity 0.5. So that gives some nice looking lens flare. And we want image effects. And the vignette is going to be 0. We've got to color grading. Oh, color is spelled the US way. Color grading. We'll go to temperature type and we'll go to color temperature. And then the temperature is going to be 9,800. Gives us a nice color there. And then film. This will probably give us a lot of properties to play with. But film on the slope is going to be 1. There we go. So we've got some nice post-processing just straight out the gate here. Making sure that you re-enable any of the visibilities that you've unset. Again, you're going around one by one and just figuring out what looks best in the scene. So some of them might be disabled. Some of them might be enabled. So just having to play around and getting a feel for how the scene is looking. And just playing with the post-processing effects. Again, if you want to just go through and modify any of the things that we've edited here. Show only modified properties. You can show all those in one line and you can just dial them in. Hopefully it gives you plenty to play with there on the post-process.",
