  "text": " So the last thing we'll go ahead and jump into is applying some foliage to the landscape. So what we want to do is we actually want to go into the foliage mode this time and you can just get any kind of static meshes you want. If you have some static meshes which are small bushes and flowers and plants, you could directly paint these in and you can select multiple different meshes. In this example we're just going to use some assets that are already in the Content Browser for the purpose of the demo, but this is how you would also paint in bushes and plants and things like this. So let's jump back into our editor. From the landscape mode we'll go into our foliage mode this time and you see this drop foliage here. And so we'll just go to our Content Browser and go into Filter, so click this little filter for Static Mesh and you'll see that we have a bunch of static meshes. We even have a little bush if we want to use the bush. So maybe in this example I'll use this bush just to give you an idea. So I'll go back, I can close this material out now. I'll go into the bush and drag and drop the bush into there. If I just create this drop down here you can see that the bush is there. And then I might just for the purpose of demonstration also drag and drop the rock in just to show you how the different properties can look here. So let's give ourselves a bit more real estate here. Give ourselves options here so you can see that we have the density of what this property is. We also have the radius of how we want to place them down. We also have the rock, so maybe I want to change the density down to 20 just to show there's some variation in that. And also the scale, maybe I just want to create a scale of maybe 0.1 to 0.3 for example and I'll just get a nice variation between the scale of 0.1 and 0.3 for these. So many, many different properties that you can play around with. You've got the angles, you've got randomizing yours, different things going on. But essentially we could just jump in and start painting and instantly see that we've got some nice rocks being placed. And again the rocks aren't as frequent as the plants because there's only a density of 20 whereas the plants have a density of 100 there. So we'll get fewer rocks placed around and so you'll see that maybe then I want to bring up the density of the rocks and I'll put that to 100. Maybe I'll bring down the bushes now to 20 and instead of the bushes being a scale of 0.1 maybe I'll bring them between 0.4 and 0.6. And again you can see now we're just in the creativity mode and maybe we're going between 1 and 3 rocks. And now it's just about creating the type of interest that you want here. So we're just painting and painting and maybe I'll bring these rocks down. 3 is a little bit big for me here so then I'll go to maybe 0.8 to 1 and again that density is probably a little bit too high still for me. So maybe I'll bring down the density to 40. And yeah essentially we're just painting in the types of things. Again we've got a few plants, a few rocks. We want the density down to like 5 now with some bigger rocks but then bring up this density of the plants to say 60. And again you can see we're just kind of manipulating the content however we want it to look. And you can see we can quickly fill out a scene with some foliage. Very intuitive tools. Again I'd recommend playing around with all the settings that you see to get the type of outcome you want. But essentially that's all the tools that we were covering today. And so just to give you a quick overview of what we created. We created a new landscape. We learned how to sculpt the landscape and then we painted it in material. We applied some foliage to that landscape to create the desired effect. So hopefully that was a really worthwhile tutorial for you. Again very straightforward intuitive tools that you can get a lot out of and it's just more about refining that process and figuring out the tools that work best for you and the desired outcome that you want. So yeah hope you found that useful and thanks for watching the video.",
