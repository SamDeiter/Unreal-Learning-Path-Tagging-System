This final component is going to be used as an overlap volume. So we are going to look for a box collision. There are a number of different collision shapes that we can work with. All of them have the same functionality, they just have different shapes. Since this is a square door, a box will do fine. Once this is added, I am going to move it to the centre of the door and then I will use the Scale tool to make it larger. We are going to use this collision to detect when the player is close enough to interact with the door. So the user could come from either direction. Make sure it is large enough to cover both sides of the door. Now I'm going to hit Compile and Save to keep all of my changes.",
