  "text": " Blueprint interfaces are a way to efficiently communicate with various blueprints throughout your project without having to load the entire blueprint into memory. Now with our particular project it's relatively small so this introduction to blueprint interfaces is to do just that and to introduce you to blueprint interfaces because as your project grows in complexity these are going to be very very important to your project's success. So to create them what we do is we come over to the content browser and we right click we look for the blueprint category and then we select our interface. Inside the interface it's going to look very familiar to a blueprint graph but the big difference is that it's going to say read only across the top here and we're only going to be able to actually add inputs and outputs but for our case what we're going to be doing is we're going to create a new blueprint interface and we are going to add two inputs to it a score and a time and that way we can more easily pass these values around to our interface and our car and things like that. So let's pop over to the editor and do this right now. So I'm actually going to close this I'm going to hit control space and I'm going to navigate up to our content folder right click we're going to go to blueprint and add a blueprint interface. Now I like to call mine BPI for blueprint interface we're to call this I think vehicle. Alright and then let's double click on it to open it up. Now once you have it open we have a new function so we're going to right click on this and rename it to picked up objects and then what we're going to do is under our inputs we're going to add one and two and we're going to call this one score and we're to call the other one time. We also need to change these from booleans to integer values so there we go both sets integers and once we're done we do need to compile and save. What we need to do after that is we need to assign this blueprint interface to the blueprint we wish to work with. In our case that's going to be the BPP sports car so what we're going to do is we're going to come back over here to the editor we're going to hit control space we're going to go look for our blueprints and then we're going to go sports car and there's our BPP sports car so that's the one that we want right there. Double click on it to open it up and to add a interface we come over to our class settings and then under our interfaces you can see we have this implemented interfaces right now we have no interfaces so what we're going to do is we're going to go to add and then from the search we're going to type in BPI and that's going to bring everything a little bit easier for us to navigate and there's our BPI vehicle so we're going to click on that and compile and save. Now once we've done that we're going to now create the following bit of code so what we're going to do is event picked up objects we're going to get the current score we're going to set the current score and then we're going to cast to our game mode to get the time remaining and then set the time remaining and this is going to set up the logic for us to work with our pickups so to do this what we're going to do here is we're going to come over to our BP sports car we do need to add some variables so we're going to add one and two and this first one we're going to right click and we're going to rename this one to current score and actually we don't need the second one right now we're actually just going to delete that so also need to change our current score to a integer and compile and save so that we can use it so let's go ahead and just move somewhere off to the side here and what we're going to do now is we're going to look for our event picked up and there we go event picked up objects and what are we going to do with this well for our we need to get our current score so we're going to grab this and we're going to go get because we want to get the current value of that so let's set up our score and then our time so we're going to take our score we're going to hit the plus sign here I'm going to go utilities operators add we're going to add these two together right so we want to take ouur score from the pick up here and then we want to add that to our current score and then what we want to do is we want to take our current score we're going to bring this out again and we're going to go set current score and what we're basically going to be doing is incrementing our score so as our score updates we're going to take our current score we're going to add that to our score value that comes in here and then update our current score again. So basically we're going to iterate on our current score. And we're going to do something similar with the time remaining. So we're going to get game mode because remember our time is set up inside of our game mode. We could have set the time up in here but it's better to set the time up inside of the game mode. And again remember our game is very small. This is just good practice for how things should be built inside of Blueprints as your projects grow longer. So what we're going to do here is from this return value we are going to cast, not gassed, but cast to BPGMVehicleBasic. There we go. And we're also going to right click on this and convert this to a purecast. Now the difference is that basically a purecast is assuming that we know exactly what we're doing and the values that we are getting. It's not going to involve any error checking. So we're going to right click on this convert to a purecast and then what we're going to do here is we are going to go time and we are going to get the time remaining. So there we go. And then from our time here what we're going to do is we're going to hit the plus sign so we have an add operation. And basically again we're going to do something very similar here. I'm going to actually double click on this line to add what's known as a redirector to make this a little bit easier for us to see. But we're going to take our, from our game mode we are going to get our time remaining and then we're going to take what the time remaining is and we are going to add that to the time that comes in from our pickup. And then what we're going to do here is we are going to pull off of this set and we might be able to get this set time. No, what we're going to have to do is a pull off of here. So we're going to pull off of this and we're going to go set time and there we go set time remaining is the value that we are looking for. And what we want to do here is we want to grab from this set and plug in like so. And then we want to take the output of this addition and plug this in. And I'm also going to double click on these lines to clear this up. So for some reason we have this extra node here so let's just move that out of the way. So there we go. That is what we're looking at. Now if you need a second or two to get caught up we're going to pause right here now before we go into the next part which is a score and time pickup. So this is all we have for this part and when you are done you should have something that looks like this.",
