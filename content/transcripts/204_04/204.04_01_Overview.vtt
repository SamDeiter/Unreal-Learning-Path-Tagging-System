Hello, and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on the introduction to HMI optimization.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.840
So today we'll be talking about how to set your projects up. We'll go through mesh and

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.320
texture optimizations, and then go into material optimizations. We'll talk about the optimization

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.280
view modes, and then we'll talk about optimization tools. So lots of great content to optimize

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.160
your projects. So let's get stuck in.
