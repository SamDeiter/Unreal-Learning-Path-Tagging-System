00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Let's first jump into how to set our projects up.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.520
So the main feature we want to talk about here is the mobile HDR.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.520
Mobile HDR has a huge impact on your project's performance.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.800
So as you see on the left hand image here, with it turned off, your project will still

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.680
run fast, but you won't have the additional render features.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820
Whereas on the right hand side here, you can see it enabled.

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.360
And although the project may run a little bit more slower, you'll still have lots of

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.080
the rendering features enabled.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.520
So to keep the details from the HDR lighting, the mobile HDR rendering pipeline will draw

10
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.380
the HDR scene color buffer first.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.800
It then converts it to the LDR post-process pass and sends it to the back buffer.

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.880
So these render target operations cost different performances based on the different hardwares,

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.280
but from a visual perspective, the LDR rendering pipeline dims and flats the highlight in the

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.280
scene.

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.840
So you need to tweak and hack your lighting settings and then the cube map also to compensate

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.920
for the final visual result.

17
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.680
Meanwhile, you may lose some of the post-process effects such as bloom and rendering effects

18
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
like that.

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.720
So it's good to keep in mind how you want to approach HDR on mobile.

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
Of course, there's always a payoff between performance, but if you're looking for the

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.240
extra rendering features, it's worth highlighting this and turning it on in your project settings.
