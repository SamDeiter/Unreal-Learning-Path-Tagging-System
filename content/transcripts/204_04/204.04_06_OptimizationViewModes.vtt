00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
As promised, let's touch upon a few optimization view modes that we can look at here. So our

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.400
first one is going to be lighting complexity. And what is lighting complexity and how do

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.800
we use it? So we can actually get to the view modes as well I should say, by from the editor,

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.060
you can go to show on the top of the editor window, and you'll be able to see these different

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.600
view modes. So one of the properties will be optimization view modes. And then you can

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.080
go and find lighting complexity. Now in more recent versions of Unreal Engine, so I think

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.960
it's Unreal Engine 5.1 onwards, you can actually just click show and you can actually type in the

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.040
box. If you typed in lighting complexity, it would find the lighting complexity option. So

9
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.760
that's useful to keep in mind. But lighting complexity shows how many non static lights

10
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.800
are affecting your geometry. So the more non static lights you have affecting a surface,

11
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.520
the more expensive it'll be. So red means the area will have performance issues when it's run,

12
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.520
so you can see it gets a little bit expensive on the right hand side here. And ideally,

13
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.480
on this left hand side, you want these darker blues to brighter greens for the lighting

14
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.120
complexity. As you move lights around increase or decrease the radius, you can see the cost

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.080
that the lights have and that will change the complexity. So on the shading complexity,

16
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.920
if lighting complexity showed how many non static lights are affecting the geometry,

17
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.120
the more this on the shader complexity side, the shader complexity is showing how many

18
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.320
shader instructions it has to run to render each pixel. So green means that it only took a few,

19
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.560
whilst white can mean 1000 plus render passes. So ideally, you want to see all of this green

20
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.400
information, green or dark green is more ideal. And you can see that when we're looking at

21
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.440
transparency, whether it be on the headlights or the car windshield, it'll get worse, the more

22
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.980
translucent objects we have to look at. So we want to reduce the material complexity and make sure

23
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.520
we're not wasting too much transparent space. And we can also take on practices that we learned in

24
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.080
the previous mesh optimization series that can reduce some transparency as well. Lastly,

25
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.160
we'll talk about quad overdraw. And quad overdraw, if we think about GPUs work on a two by two quad

26
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.960
granularity, which means thin and small triangles, small and two by two, these can result in lots

27
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.480
more work to calculate than bigger pixels on the screen or bigger triangles on the screen. So you

28
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.560
can lessen the impact on this by making use of LRDs that get rid of smaller triangles that can't

29
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.200
be seen from a distance. But also we want to make sure we have as much blue sharp as possible. So

30
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.520
the more green into the pinks and purples, it gets super expensive. So this is a relatively

31
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.160
okay image. But if you could pull your camera back from this car, you'd want to make sure you

32
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
had LRDs in place to reduce some of the complexity of this mesh here.
