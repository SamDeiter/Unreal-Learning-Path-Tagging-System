  "text": " Okay, so for this video, we're going to take a look at an alternate setup for the fingers. Essentially we created a system that allows us to use a function and kind of look at the functionality that we can take advantage of there. However, if you see the actual setup of it, you can tell that, if I take a look at it right now, this is the most beautiful setup with this massive set of arrays here. So just for the sake of keeping things clean and showing you another method, we're going to take a look at another way of doing it. And essentially what we're going to do is we're going to get all of the bones that we want to create a constraint to and essentially make a parent constraint between the control and the bone. We're going to try and go about it as cleverly as we can. So in order to do this, let me just put this out of the way. In order to do this, the first thing I'm going to do is use a getChildren node. So I'm going to get the children of the hand. So I go hand. And this will essentially get the children of the hand. Now we're not going to include the parents, so we're not going to include this guy. We don't want to do anything with the hand itself. And we're going to go ahead and make it recursive. Now the type that we're going to search for is bones. So we're going to find the bones with these names or the children of that particular bone. And we're going to do the same for the right side. So let's go ahead and turn this into hand. Now because I have two arrays now, what we'll want to do is essentially loop through an entire array. And instead of doing two loops, it's better to just append these into one array. So I'm just going to grab this right here. So append. And basically I'm turning these two arrays, I'm getting this array, and then append this other array on top of it to make one longer array essentially. Now with this, I want to do a forEach. So for each item in this array, it's just the same as in Blueprint. For each item in this array, I'm going to do a particular action or something. So the element that I'm going to use is going to be the bone. And what we want to do is create a parent constraint between the control and the bone. Now currently we only have access to the bone, but I'm going to show you a nifty trick to get the controls out of it. So let's go ahead and use a parent constraint. And the parent constraint is really simple. It's going to ask us, do you want to know what the child is and what the parent is? And really that's all there is. So within the parents, you can see we have items and we can choose what the parent is. And we've got the child with what the child is as well. So how do we set this up? So the child is always going to be the bone. We're going to be driving the bone rotation and transform location based on those of the control. And I want the parent of this constraint to be the control. Now we could go and make another set of arrays and then find each index for each control here. But if you notice, the names of our controls are just the name of the bones with underscore control add it on top. So what I can do is grab the name of whatever bone we're looking at currently for each loop. I'm going to concatenate, which is essentially grabs a string and adds another string to it to make one string. So I'm going to get the name of the bone and I'm going to add underscore control. And this will already handle the left and right side for us because it's using both as the one array. So this is now the parent. And the type of this is a control. So we'll make sure that it's looking for the right thing. This essentially is all the setup that we need. We've got a parent constraint now between all the bones as the child and the controls as the parent. Now I am new to maintain offset here because I did change the scale of the controls and I don't want to maintain that offset. I don't want the bones to now scale to 0.3 like we did earlier. So what we're going to do is unhook all of that stuff there and we're just going to bypass it and hook this in. So what are we doing? Just to recap again. The bones, the children of the hand bones, we're converting all of those into one array. And then we're going for each item inside that array, we're creating a parent constraint between the bone and the control, the control being the parent and the bone being the child. So if I compile this, you'll see that now I have the same functionality with the parent constraint. And you can see, I think it's pretty obvious that this method is a little bit cleaner than all of this stuff that was going on here. But again, this is still a valid way of doing it and understanding functions to automate some of these processes is really, really handy. So there's nothing lost in this. It's just that this is a slightly different way of doing it. Another thing that we can take a look at. And yeah, it certainly looks cleaner as well. So here's our new rig setup. As you can see.
