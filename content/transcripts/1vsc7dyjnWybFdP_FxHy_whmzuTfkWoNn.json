  "text": " Hi, everyone. In this video, we're going to go and take a look at the course outlined for this series of videos. And we're going to also take a look at lighting terminology and types. So let's get started. So lighting terminology and types is one of the first topics we'll cover today. We'll look at lighting definitions and types, static versus dynamic and light types in general. From there, we'll go ahead and take a look at lighting property settings, and we'll dive into lights a lot deeper. Look at lighting properties and light mobility when it comes to workflows. From there, we're going to take a look at an introduction to lumen. We'll look at what is lumen, how to set it up, quality control, tips and tricks, and lumen visualization mode. From there, we're going to take a look at nanite and virtual shadow maps. Why use nanite? And then we'll go ahead and take a look at lighten tools, environment light mixer, light mixer and the day sequence tool. Now, this is going to be a brief overview on some of these because we dive into such things such as the day sequence a lot deeper in other courses. And finally, we'll look at interactive lighting exercise. We're going to go into the day sequence and we'll go ahead and look at the day sequence lighting exercise. We're going to go and light a hero object and we're going to do it interactively. And I'll walk you through some of the things to keep in mind when doing so. So let's go ahead and jump right in. So lighting terminology and types. So lighting definition types when it comes to working in our real time environment fall under these three main categories that will be adjusting and tweaking to get the visuals the way that we want. We'll look at direct lighting, indirect lighting, bounce lighting and shadows. In any DCC, you should be able to get your direct lighting where you want it and ones that are a bit more realistic and not a light on the workflows. You're going to be able to do GI and that is the bounce lighting. Unreal is one of the key and one of the forefront tools in creating realism and it does a spectacular job of creating GI, global illumination in your scenes and bounce light. Now shadows in Unreal previously were big shadows in which you would work with shadow maps but now you can actually work with virtual shadow maps. Now the difference between them is shadow maps were for the baking scenario and virtual shadow maps allow us to update our shadows on the fly. The shadows were baked previously where you would use our renderer which we'll talk about in just a second called Lightmass but now we can use Lumen and Lumen and virtual shadow maps work fantastic together. So speaking of, Lumen is Unreal 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system that is designed for next generation consoles but can also be used for linear production such as film and ICVFX. It is the default global illumination reflection system. Before that it was default baked but now Lumen is the one that starts and is up and ready to go in which you just have to change a few things to get even more visual fidelity. Lumen renders diffuse inter-flection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections in large detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. Now the baked scenario is used quite often for architecture and you can think of it as a renderer such as with V-Ray and Corona but you're typically just rendering your lights and we use our Lightmass radiosity for that. Now that's an older tool but it still can be used in Unreal and is used quite often for architectural demonstrations and so forth because they just need a static environment but Lumen is a good option outside of that because it works so great and allows you to update your lighting on the fly without having to do a re-bake. Now you can use ray tracing too with Lumen which helps support its quality control and allows you to get some really great results. You can't you don't have to if your system doesn't support it but that option is there which is really great in our project settings. It just gives you better visual fidelity, better performance and allows you to update things overall and allows your GPU to really go in there and make it so that you can build light quickly and get realism as quick as possible. You'll see there's a note on the bottom. Some aspects of ray tracing is taken into account with Lumen such as reflections and some light and object relationships to help performance but higher quality settings in the GPU can be GPU expensive. You'll hear me mention this a couple times just things to consider when we dive into the Lumen settings. As cool as it is and as we bump things up just like anything as you bump up the quality your GPU may take a little bit of a hit so please consider what you have and what you're working with hardware wise. Here are some of the light tools that we have are light types. We have a directional light. This is primarily used for sunlight. We have the point light in cases of on 3D city max you can think of it as omni light. We have the spotlight. We have the rec light and the rec light is one of my favorite lights to use. It's great for fill lights and even rim lighting setting up. It is one of the more expensive ones and I'll reiterate some of these later because it's like a series of point lights in a rectangular space. We have skylight that allows us to use an HDRI image based ambient light. It'll either pluck it from your scene or you can load an HDR image in there and again I'll walk you through how those work. A lot of times are our product. People are using unreal to advertise a product such as a car or phone. We'll choose that and not much else because it's simple and get straight to the point. We have HDR backdrop. It is a predefined HDR lighting blueprint setup. This can be used in games like in behind a window. Obviously interactively you wouldn't necessarily have that in there because it looks really fake but it's great for a nice filler. If you need something for say a backdrop for a car or some sort of product or architectural thing you're working with and in a game you can put it behind a window so you can use a little smoke and mirrors to hide that from your audience. Sun and sky lighting blueprint setup. So this also is available. This allows you to punch in the time of day and longitude and latitude. Now the only things you need to keep in mind working with this. Some people may choose the new day sequence which we'll mention later which works similar to it but not quite. It allows you to have the time of day change the change of the time of day any way that you want and even automatically have it so that it has the sunset and sunrise. So that's actually pretty cool and we'll dive into that briefly. We get into that a little bit heavier with our atmospheric lighting. So we will be mentioning some of these tools for the most part. These primary ones in pink are the ones we'll be focusing on. That's it with this lesson. You'll see here a link where you can dive in a bit deeper to know more about lights. In the next lesson we're going to go and take a look at lighting properties. Thanks again.",
