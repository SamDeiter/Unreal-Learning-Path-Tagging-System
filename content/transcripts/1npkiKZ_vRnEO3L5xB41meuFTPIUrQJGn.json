  "text": " All right, now that we have our material in a position where we can start testing, what we're going to do now is we're going to create just a basic level. And inside the basic level, we're going to make a very, very simple landscape that we can apply a material instance of our material to, to start testing. And one of the things that we're going to be testing for is this. We want to make sure that when we get to this point, everything is working because it's a lot easier to fix errors now than wait to the very end and then try to go through and fix everything. So let's pop over to the editor. I'm just going to come up to File, New Level, and we're going to select the basic new level and we're going to hit Create. All right. And then I'm just going to do select this little plane right here, just hit Delete and then come up here. Actually, first hit Control Space and we need to make an instance of our material. So we're going to right click on this, Create Material Instance. I am going to remove this MAT from the front of this, just a personal preference. Make sure that's selected. And now I'm going to come up here to my landscape. And with our material, I'm going to go ahead and press this Use Selected Asset from Content Browser. That's going to give us this instance. And then I'm going to set this to, leave it at 15 by 15 and hit Create. So this is going to create my landscape. And then the next thing I need to do here is just add a few little height variations so that we can actually see some of this stuff working. So there is a little bit of height variation. And if we notice, I'm not actually getting anything in here. I just have basically grass. So let's go ahead and kick out of our landscape tool. And then what we're going to do is we're going to select our landscape. And then in our Details panel, we're going to look for our landscape material and just double click on it to open it up. I'm going to bring this over here on screen so we can see this. And first things first, let's go ahead and head to our Slope Contrast and our Slope Falloff Power. Now I'm going to slip my Slope Contrast to 2 and then my Slope Falloff Power to 3. And let's go ahead and see if we're getting any types of details in here with this. So we're getting a little bit. A couple of things are happening here. We're actually seeing the blending being done. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up to this Distance Blend and I'm going to set this to a value of like 5. So we have that at a value of like 5,000. The other thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to pop back into my landscape mode, bring my brush down a little bit, maybe use a clay brush here and try and get some more. There we go. Get a little bit more vertical face going. Once I do that, we're going to be able to see the difference between the two a lot easier. So there we go. Got a little bit more vertical going. So we can see here the adjustment between the two. If I come in here to our Slope Contrast and I kind of adjust this a little bit. Let's set it to like 3. There we go. And then let's. Seems to be making it a little bit sharper, but there we go. We can see there. It was probably just the light was making it a little bit harder to see. So we'll leave that at a value of 1. The other thing that we're going to do is we are going to adjust our dirt tile and our far tile. So we're going to set this dirt tile to 0.1. So that's going to give us these kind of really nice looking edges there. We are going to set our far dirt tile to 0.01 and our far grass tile to 0.01. I'm also going to set our grass tile as well to 0.1 just to make things a little bit larger because we hit play here. Whoops and definitely went in the wrong location there. Let's find our player start here and we're going to just move this over and move this up a little bit. There we go. So let's hit play now. So yeah, there we go. That's looking pretty good. We've got a little stretching here, but if we notice the displacement isn't working, that's OK. We need to actually do something to our landscape first to get our displacement. So if we select our landscape here, we're going to come to enable Nanite and then we'll just build this data. And once we do that, we can get our displacement, give us a chance to cook. And look at that. There is our landscape displacement looking all cool. Little bit rocky up here or I should say a little bit too bumpy. So we might want to set this down to like 0.5. And then smoothing this will make this just work out a lot better. Maybe set this to 0.8. There we go. That's looking a little bit better. So really cool stuff right here. And then if I was to just right click and play, the displacement will really help out just give this really great looking kind of like shadow and lighting and everything like that. So it's working really well. We can also see it there kind of off in the distance as well working. So this is good. This is what we want. Now, if you have a problem with your material, let's say that you have the exact opposite of this where you have rock on the ground, but grass kind of on the slopes. One thing to check here inside of your material for this, we're just going to open up our landscape material again. Make sure that up here you have the dirt and then the grass. If you have the grass and then the dirt, it will do the opposite effect of what you want. And then we can adjust our settings and move on.",
