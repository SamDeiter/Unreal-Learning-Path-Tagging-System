  "text": " When working in Unreal Engine, it's important to have the right hardware for the job. If it's your intent to animate within the engine and leverage tools like MetaHumans, Live Link, Control Rig, or other processor and GPU intensive tasks, Epic recommends an Intel i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 5950X or better processor. Get 64 gigs of RAM and a solid-state hard drive as well. It's also important to choose a proper GPU. By examining your role in production, you can make a solid choice of which car to buy. Modelers, shading artists, and animators can be served very well by an RTX 4080, 4090, 5070 Ti, 5080, or 5090 GPUs. Whereas lighting artists, rendering specialists, and virtual production teams are required to use powerful GPUs with higher-end GPUs like the RTX Pro 5000 and 6000 Blackwell, RTX 6000 and 5000 ETA, or the RTX A6000 or A5000 Ampere-based cards. When it comes to level management and organization, the best practices dictate placing all of your commonly shared global actors into the persistent level, while dividing up your action into beats. These beats can have their own dedicated level. Once that's accomplished, sublevels can help manage your scene assembly organization. Be careful not to have too many sublevels because that can be difficult to manage. Level visibility can turn on and off sublevels as the shot requires, and when rendering, it's wise to change the streaming method for your sublevels to always loaded. This will place the sublevel into active memory for faster access. When planning your shots, consider optimizing your foreground, mid-ground, and background elements to ease your rendering burden. Single level sequences with a single camera cuts track can be great for setting up master shots with multiple coverage cameras. Plus, it's great for simple editing. For distinct shot-based workflows, it's recommended that you nest your level sequences together with a shot track. This will provide greater organization and accessibility for nonlinear workflows and makes your team work easier. Try not to exceed more than three levels of nesting, and if you need alternates to your shots, use the take system to swap between level sequences. Many people wonder what are the best practices for using actor persistence. Choose spawnables for temporary background actors, custom shot-specific lighting, or one-off effects. Make sure you're not parenting to the spawnable actor because those actors will disappear after the level sequence ends. This will kill any parenting setup for those spawnable actors in the level. Attached tracks or constraints might be a better idea. Spawnables also have the advantage of reducing memory overhead for those actors who are not in use. As for possessables, use these actors for fixed assets, scene environments, or characters planned to be used throughout all shots. Unlike spawnables, possessables are not destroyed after the shot completes, so they're always accessible. We also have some resource links available for you. These white papers, communities, and online documentation will help guide you through potential questions you might have. Okay, this concludes our lecture on transitioning from legacy production to Unreal Engine. Thank you. Thanks for watching!",
