  "text": " So, widget animations. It's worth just kind of like breaking this down a little bit. We've already seen the widget animation window, but it's just worth highlighting that the widget animation system is essentially a re-implementation of the Sequencer. So for anyone who's not familiar with Sequencer, Sequencer is Unreal's kind of cinematic authoring tool. It replaced the previous cinematic authoring tool, which was called Matinee, back in like 416, I'm going to say. Don't quote me on that. It started off, as with many things, as an experimental tool and has gained more functionality and has become kind of more performant and more kind of stable over time. And at some point they introduced that as a... you didn't used to be able to author widget animations using Sequencer, but that's been introduced. So when we're talking about widget animations, typically we're talking about the implementation, the kind of Sequencer-esque implementation. It is not the only way to author animations within a widget. You can essentially code your animations, which is actually slightly more performant. But this is kind of the easiest, most graphical, most probably user-friendly way to control things, and it gives us a lot of animation-like control. So for any animators who want their kind of like nice curves and to kind of really control all the kind of blends and stuff like that, it's quite likely that using the kind of Sequencer implementation of the animation is really what we're going to be talking about. So in similar fashion to Sequencer, each animation is really a collection of kind of named properties or bindings. So animation essentially has bindings to kind of various entities that it animates, and each of those entities has various properties which are kind of defined by individual tracks, and those tracks can then be keyed. So keying is a term that will be familiar to anyone who's used to a little bit of animation before, and each of these things can be keyframes. You specify particular values at particular points, and then some kind of logic will be used to blend between those two points over several frames. Yeah, it's worth mentioning that like particular keyframes can't be changed at runtime. They say this is more of a kind of like you're basically authoring animations at editor time here. There are various techniques that you can utilise to make these a little bit more dynamic or possibly reusable and more kind of contextual, but for the most part, unless you're being a little bit clever with your blend modes and stuff like that, you are kind of authoring relatively static information here. So creating a widget animation, we've got just a little demonstration of what a widget animation might look like in an incredibly high resolution and a high frame rate GIF. But yeah, we're going to do a simple adjustment of a transform property with an animation, but obviously the kind of same principles can be layered up and applied to several animations over time. So first off, we've got our animation window, which we've already talked about, and this is how you would create a new animation. You just click the new animation button and then you can just name the animation. And then if we were to go into our animation, you can see here that when you click on an animation, the first thing I want to highlight is that we get this little parameter on the edge. This is basically a warning that lets you know that you're currently in an animation mode, which is quite important to bring up because any changes you're making whilst this is selected could be things you're inadvertently keying into your animation and it might not be information that you're permanently changing about the widget. So it's just really worth remembering that when you're in an animation, you might not be making permanent changes to your widget. This might be animation that is specifically applying to that animation. I'm just going to quickly jump here because the GIF is incredibly distracting. If we actually dock that in the layout, so we make a new animation, some add it. And you can see as soon as I click that I get this border to say, hey, you're in animation mode. So just try and pay some attention to this. Off it is meant to be a little bit obnoxious to kind of really make sure that you know that. If you want to be sure that you're not accidentally keying information into your animation and as importantly, if not more importantly, not making the permanent changes that you might want to be making to your widget, just click off the animation and you're no longer trying to write information into your actual animation. So then if we were to go into my animation, I can just basically pick some content to kind of add here. If I actually give my images a bit of a name because this can be a little bit confusing, this is a general tip that I would say is no different from naming your variables properly. It's that for the purposes of animation but also for code, it's kind of good to name your widgets properly so they can be easily distinguished. So if I just say like, I would normally call things like canvas panel underscore root, this is a personal naming convention, this isn't necessarily something that would be used all over Epic, but then I'm just going to call this image top left and I'm going to call this one image centre. And just makes them a little bit easier to distinguish from each other. So then if I go to right click, you can see I can add, this is depending on whatever I've got currently selected, you can see I can add a kind of entity that I want to animate here. So this is going to, because I currently have image centre selected, I can bind that. So if I then do that, you can see if I click on this plus icon here, so here's our binding, here's the thing that we're actually trying to animate, but then we need to say what kind of like property about this thing do I want to change, do I want to animate its colour and opacity, do I want to animate its root slot. So for the purpose of moving this thing, as we've already said, the slot is what kind of defines this thing's layout and in the context of a canvas panel, the slot has a lot of control over its pixel coordinates and stuff like that, so we'll go and animate the slot. And then you see we get this kind of sub track and this is basically to say this is data that belongs to this particular entity, so if I were to similarly key frame our image top left and do the same thing at a canvas slot, you can see the kind of way that hierarchy is going to be laid out, that when I'm talking about this one, this is the slot for this image and this is the slot for this image. And similarly, if I were to do the same thing and similarly, if I were to add something that's going to define the colour and opacity, that is the colour and opacity for this widget and if I were to add something like, I don't know, the visibility track here, this is going to be the visibility for this image. So these things are kind of like hierarchical, we have the entity itself and then we have the various bits of information about the entity that we're key framing. So then we just select whatever kind of property that we want to key frame and then we just key frame it essentially. We can, the easiest way to probably do this is you'll notice here in our details panel, we have the various variables available to us and you'll notice we've got this little icon that appears on the right. This essentially represents any bit of information that is animatable. So this isn't just an animation frame thing, the same thing appears here. You see they're currently kind of grayed out and locked and that's because we're not in animation so key framing this thing means nothing. But it's a good way of just taking a quick look to be like, what information would even be key framed? This can help when you're kind of designing solutions to problems to be like, oh, is it possible that I might be able to use an animation to adjust this property? If it doesn't have a little key frame icon next to it then know that animation is, that variable is not key frameable. Worth bearing in mind as well because it can also answer certain questions for you. For example, we have colour and opacity of this image that is key frameable but if we go to our brush, our brush's tint isn't key frameable. So that can actually lead you to certain conclusions like if you don't want your code, if you want to be able to tweak the colour of something but you want an animation that fades that thing in and out and you're worried that your code is going to clash with your animation, bearing in mind that the tint isn't key frameable and therefore could never be animated, maybe the tint is what you can be adjusting the colour of and you can rely on the fact that colour and opacity is probably going to be the thing that you're adjusting for your opacity. Although on that particular there is also a key frameable value which is your render opacity which you could also specifically key frame uniquely for rendering opacity. So maybe you can avoid that problem entirely there as well. So if we were to go to, there are several different ways to do this but if, sorry my computer is suddenly running a bit slowly there. So if we were to add, obviously our canvas panel slot itself has several bits of data within it so we wouldn't just want to key frame the slot entirely, we have lots of different bits of data. It can be a little bit confusing in the context of our canvas panel slot because we have these things called anchors, minimum and maximum, then we have alignment and offsets but we're kind of used to seeing position X and Y. That's because our position X and Y is actually an offset from whatever our anchor is. So when we're talking about our position X and Y that's actually this offsets value here. So if I did offsets and I had a key frame you can see our initial key frame or our initial values are just whatever our standard values are. They're not yet key framed so this isn't going to be like saved as the beginning of our animation so I can just quickly like bind a key frame here and you can see I have, I don't know why that hasn't, why those aren't actually, oh they are being written in there just for some reason not really appearing properly in my animation. You can control and mouse wheel by the way to kind of zoom in and out on your timeline, that's a kind of standard sequence of thing, and right click and then to kind of pan and if I were to kind of just drop in another set of key frames here you can now see I get kind of like a timeline being constructed and I can go to these key frames and either I can edit my values here so I could change this to like 2000 and you would see the widget would move to the right well actually off the edge of my screen here or I could change that in here. Now it's worth mentioning that when you're making tweaks inside the editor itself this is not currently key framed even though I'm over a key frame I would actually have to choose to bake this change into my key data by clicking the key frame button again and you see that gets updated there. And now when I scroll back and forth you can see that value is actually going to change like this and I can also demo it by playing it and see what it would actually do. And just if I want to add a little bit more functionality to it I could also do some colour and opacity stuff so I'm just going to over that same timeline I'm going to do key frame a couple of different things and I'm going to key frame my colour twice and I'm going to key frame it. I'm going to go to my editor here and I'm going to go to my colour and opacity and I'm going to change it to like red and key frame that and then I'm going to change it to blue here or I'm going to key frame that. And the other thing you can do is you have like free control over these key frames themselves so I can move these back a bit you can shrink your overall time so you can say this entire I'm going to pull back the entire duration of this thing and you can see that this is I can essentially adjust the overall size of my this thing is going to take so that my key frames don't necessarily have to take quite so long. You can actually scale the key frames so that you're kind of shrinking these things in a percentage way but if you just see as I'm scrubbing it shifts from red to blue and if I were to preview this animation red to blue so I'm key framing multiple elements together and I can preview it in a very visual way. The last thing to mention is that if I now that I've got this animation you can see clearly I've made some changes outside of animation time and that's kind of some of that stuff has kind of been either like locked in so just worth it's worth kind of jumping between the two clearly at some point I accidentally made some change to data that wasn't actually being baked into my animation and that's why I'm saying it's very important to bear these things in mind so I'm just going to set that back to those initial values that I expect them to be at. This isn't going to be affecting the animation which we can tell because we've not got that border on and now I'm just going to compile and save that so this is our standard starting point and when I go to my animation you can see we this is the effect it has when it plays and when I click off it resets back to its defaults. So that's that's kind of all through an animation the other thing just to kind of mention is that whenever you're making an animation each animation you create becomes almost like an asset in your your user widget is unique to this widget so this isn't this isn't going to your content browser this is built into the UMG itself and so for every animation that you make you would get that get another entry in your variable section under animations so this can then be used in code you can play this animation so I'm very quickly going to demonstrate this I'll actually you couple together some of the stuff we've already seen so I'm going to just put a delay we don't need to worry about what construct actually is yet but I'm just going to delay for a second and then play this animation and in my level blueprint I'm going to I'm going to make a new level and I'm just going to go to my level blueprint we're going to create our whatever we just called that my new widget my view my new widget and we're going to add that to our viewport again making it isn't enough we actually have to put it on our screen so when we begin play we can see it will appear in the center of our screen and then it animates off you just have to trust that it's blue and on the right side of our screen but obviously because it went off the edge of the canvas it's we can't see it anymore so we can see that's all working really nicely",
