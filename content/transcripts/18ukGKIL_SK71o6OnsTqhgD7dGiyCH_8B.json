  "text": " So this video should be a blast. We've added physics and all kinds of things now. And if we hop into Unreal, here we go. And if your screen looks a little different than mine, just hit the little back arrow in your take recorder and you'll be good. And I want us to go back to the third person character blueprint. And if you don't remember, it's just in the content browser, third person BP blueprint section right there. Okay cool. So we have floppy arms. That's where we left off last time. And you know, what if this time we don't want the arms to be 100% floppy? We want to actually retain some of the integrity of our animations. So how about we focus on that on the left arm. And just to make room for the new nodes, I'm going to move these over to the right. And let's drag off of this execution wire and type in set all bodies below physics. And we want the blend weight with the mesh already plugged in. There we go. And let me move these over a little bit more, make some more room. Okay, I'll move the mesh down. Great. Okay, next thing. This node, it also needs to know which bone it's talking to. And so I will drag off of this make literal, plug it into in bone name, and then double click on that wire to get a reroute node so you can make it much easier to read. And how about we change the blend weight to 0.2. So what that is saying is, okay, we're going to have 20% physics and 80% animation. So compile, save, go to third person example map, hit play. And if I'm running around, one side looks ridiculous. And the other side is pretty decent. Pretty close to the run, but it's also got a bit more flop to it, right? And if you wanted, you could also use timeline nodes to create a smooth transition of the physics blend weight. And this is useful if say your character loses health over time, and you want to specify keys on a curve to control how quickly that change takes place. And let's get on to the fun part, explosions. I will go back to the third person character blueprint tab. And I'm going to just find an empty space and go over to the add component button on the left. And I'm going to add a radial force. Click on that. And if we go to the viewport tab, we will see we have this sphere thing. And it's exactly what it sounds like. It gives off a force in a radial direction. And I'm going to move it down and maybe a little bit to the right so that when my character reacts, he flies off in this direction. And just to make things more pronounced, I'm going to go over to the impulse section and type in a couple more zeros for the impulse strength. And we'll go back to the event graph because we need to actually talk to the radial force so that we can have an explosion type thing going on. So drag the radial force into the event graph. And then from there, drag and I just want you to type in fire impulse. And you'll see it's a function that the radial force has built in. Click on the fire impulse. And so we're just making the force go off, right? And how about we make this happen anytime we press the number one. So if I right click, type in key one, or if you wanted the num pad, you could type in num one, but I'll do key one and grab that one right there. So the event is fired when the one key is pressed or released. And I'll move that up. And so how about when we press it, we will fire the impulse. So I will drag that execution wire across and connect it. Let's hit compile and save. Go back to third person example map and hit play. And how about I move closer to some of these objects? And then I hit one and we had a lot of things moving one of the spheres, the ragdoll guy, and our character. So I would say that's pretty cool. And we could record this as well. And how about this time we not record the floppy guy? We'll just do the spheres and our third person character. So all I did was just click on this toggle right here. And again, just a reminder, we're going to hit play, hit F8 to get control of our mouse again, record and then hit F8 and then we'll do whatever we want to do and fire off the explosion and then hit escape. So let's do play F8 record. F8, I'll move my guy over a bit and then I'll hit one. And then we have all of that and hit escape. So we could review the last recording. And there he goes. And wait for it. Off he flies. So if you like this course and want to learn more, there's an excellent live training by Wes Bunn called Animation Pose Snapshot. And he shows you how to create more natural ragdoll to standing animations. Or if you go to the Learn tab of your Epic launcher, right here, there's actually a project called Content Examples. It's a pretty large project, but it's got so much material and you can check out the animation physics level. And then one more thing, Lewis Kataldi has a really great class called Unreal Editor Fundamentals Animation on the online learning portal. And that is really great. So that's about it for this course. Hopefully your eyes are opened to all of the possibilities. And in the next video, we'll recap Take Recorder and all of the topics that we covered.",
