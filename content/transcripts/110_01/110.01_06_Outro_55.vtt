00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
So, that is it.

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.179
That is going to wrap up this video tutorial.

3
00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.839
And in this tutorial, we covered what Niagara is.

4
00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:17.320
We talked about Niagara being Unreal's solution for any visual effects, no matter if you are

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.839
a film person or an architect or a game developer, you can find some use for Niagara.

6
00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.960
We then looked over the various Niagara content examples and then took a look at the Niagara

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.120
interface.

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.480
And finally, we put all this information together and created our first Niagara effect, which

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.920
was some lit smoke that used a sub-UV to help simulate the smoke actually moving even more.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.519
So I hope you learned something and I appreciate having you here and I will see you next time.
