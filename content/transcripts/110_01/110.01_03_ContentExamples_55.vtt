00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
Now Niagara offers a number of content examples that shows you how to do pretty much anything

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.599
you could ever want to do.

3
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.280
And the reason I'm bringing them up is these can act as some really great learning content.

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.039
And the examples that I'm talking about are Niagara particles, Niagara advanced and Niagara

5
00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.039
fluids.

6
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.080
Now in Niagara particles, you're going to learn the very basics of Niagara.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.480
It's going to show you how to do simple sprite and static mesh emitters.

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.719
There's GPU beams as well as emitters with multiple renderers.

9
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.679
And then showing you how to do things like simple collision or texture sampling, playing

10
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.320
audio and alignment and a few other things.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.560
Niagara advanced, you're going to find a variety of ways that you can interact with

12
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
Niagara.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.400
There are simulation stages, reading and writing to rendered targets or sampling from a skeletal

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.280
mesh or a GPU buffer.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.640
There's also using attributes and distance field traversal.

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.400
You can also see some examples on bird flocking, 3D grid support, as well as component rendering,

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.879
exporting particles to blueprints and even sampling from dynamic distance fields.

18
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.439
Now Niagara fluids, this is where you're going to find a variety of emitters that can be

19
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.180
used to simulate smoke and liquids in real time.

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.799
Examples here included are gas and liquid, quality versus performance, light interaction,

21
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.599
particles infection, there's going to be camera facing smoke and fire, as well as 3D

22
00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:31.599
smoke and fire.

23
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.239
So let's just pop over to the end of really quick and take a look at some of these.

24
00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.239
So first off, hit control space and we're going to go to our maps folder here and the

25
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:44.959
content examples, NI and NIA and there is our Niagara particles.

26
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.879
So let's just double click on this to open it up and have a look at it.

27
00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:53.000
So it's going to start over here and then as we go to the right, the particles are going

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.719
to get more and more complex.

29
00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.719
So the examples again start off here, we're going to go with our sprite and then there

30
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.760
is a mesh and then as we go on, we're doing GPU and sprite facing.

31
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.000
So all of these really, really fantastic examples that you can see here that goes all the way

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.800
down here to a mesh orientation versus rotational force.

33
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.199
Next we're going to have our advanced one.

34
00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.319
I'm not going to save that.

35
00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.000
And in our advanced, we start again over here at looking at our render targets and then

36
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.879
going all the way over till we get to sampling from our dynamic sampling from our distance

37
00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.479
field right here.

38
00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.759
And there's tons of just different examples that we can use here for anything that we

39
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.120
would really want.

40
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
This is really cool.

41
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.439
This is the start of a structural support.

42
00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:49.000
So some of this stuff as it starts to come undone, everything is going to start to fall

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.159
down in different stages.

44
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.359
So there's just really great examples that we can use here.

45
00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.840
Last but not least Niagara fluids.

46
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.599
So open this one up and have a look at it.

47
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.479
Now Niagara fluids is quite expensive.

48
00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:10.159
So if you're running with lots of programs open, you might need to close some to get

49
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.199
this to run.

50
00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.560
But again, as we start here, we're going to go for something very simple like this is

51
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.879
a 2D gas and liquid simulation.

52
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.439
And then we have a 3D one right next to it.

53
00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.640
You can see here there's quality versus performance.

54
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.960
There's fire.

55
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.280
Some of these do require that you come up here and press play.

56
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.280
I just am recording.

57
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.960
So I want to make sure that let's just try and simulate and see if that can help us.

58
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.159
I might actually have to press play.

59
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.000
And there we go.

60
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Get up close to some of this.

61
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.240
I think some of this I have to get really close to it in order for it to work.

62
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.240
There we go.

63
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.639
So there's some fire rendering.

64
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.639
It's working with the lighting.

65
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.639
There's a little bit of lighting offset there.

66
00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.280
You can see the particles are changing colors.

67
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.639
A lot of really, really great and cool stuff here.

68
00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.479
So definitely worth checking out.

69
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:09.879
Now one of the last things that I want to talk about before we go on is every part of

70
00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.319
the content examples also contains information about what is going on.

71
00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.519
So if I do go to one of these and I open it up, I'm going to see comments about what is

72
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.399
going on and why this is set up in the way.

73
00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:28.319
And again, this is why this works for such a good learning resource is I can not only

74
00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.319
have a look at stuff.

75
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:36.439
You know, if I come in here, maybe look at something like maybe we grab this one.

76
00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:43.399
So let's hit control E and then I come in here and it looks like I grabbed a bad one

77
00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:50.399
for a let's go into our particles here because I know that these ones are.

78
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.959
Let's look at that one right there.

79
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.839
Maybe hit a control E and there we go.

80
00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:03.040
So this one has a little bit more information inside of it as the fluids are documented

81
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.240
on the website.

82
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.800
Again, we can open up a lot of these and we're going to see inside of them a lot of information

83
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.280
about how we can use these or shouldn't say how we can use it, but why these.

84
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.639
Particles work in the way that they do and things that we need to be aware of when we

85
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.439
are using them.
