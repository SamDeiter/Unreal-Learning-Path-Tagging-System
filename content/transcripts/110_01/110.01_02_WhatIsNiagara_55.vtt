00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
Now, for anybody that's not aware, what Niagara is, is, well, it's very simple.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.480
Niagara is a tool for creating visual effects inside of Unreal Engine 5.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.160
With Niagara, you can create anything from a simple smoke to an interactive crowd simulation.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.199
Niagara is also built for everyone in need of visual effects, whether you work in architectural

5
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.920
visualization, you just need maybe a simple something for ambience, or you work in industrial

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.240
design such as automotive designs, and you need to use some visual effects to heighten

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.760
your user interface, or maybe possibly add some tire smoke, or maybe you work in virtual

8
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.160
TV and film production, and you need some magical spells, or maybe in video games where

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.840
there's all types of different effects.

10
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.480
Unreal's Niagara system is going to be where you can create all of this different type

11
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.120
of effects for whatever your needs happen to be.

12
00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.959
And here are some great examples of things that you can create with Niagara.

13
00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:04.679
Now, these are taken right from the content examples, which we'll cover here in the next

14
00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:12.319
slide, but what these are showing is just the absolute insanity that you can make with

15
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.319
this tool.

16
00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.039
It is extremely powerful.

17
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.079
And what we have here is we actually have particles that are spawning on the surface

18
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.759
of a skeletal mesh.

19
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.680
We have the beginning of a fluid simulation.

20
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720
We also have on the right hand side particles that react to the light.

21
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720
That's right.

22
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.640
As that light shines across that face right there, those bugs are going to move around

23
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.560
and scurry to get out of the way of the light.

24
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.080
And this is all done through Niagara.

25
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.960
And you can see just from this images that this is a very powerful tool.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.719
So we'll show you some stuff you can do in the content examples.

27
00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.079
You're going to see why Niagara is such a great tool for you to learn how to use.
