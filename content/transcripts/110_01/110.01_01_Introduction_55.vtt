Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with Epic Games.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the following video tutorial, we're going to be taking an introductionary look at Niagara

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and how we can use Niagara to power all sorts of visual effects inside of Unreal.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, we're first going to start off by exploring what Niagara is.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then we're going to take a look at the Niagara content examples as these provide a really great reference

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for all of your questions that you might have about Niagara when it comes to what it can do

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and even help give you ideas of things that you might not have considered before.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we're going to take a look at the Niagara Editor overview

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we're going to punish that up with creating our first Niagara effect.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's right, we're going to be actually getting hands on with this and creating a smoke using Niagara.

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So, let's go ahead and jump right in with what is Niagara.
