00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Before we jump into using Niagara, we're going to take a quick look at Niagara as a whole

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and get more information about what we are using so we better understand how things are set up and they work.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now the first thing that we want to talk about with Niagara is inheritance.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And that's because inheritance plays a massive role inside of Niagara.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So each Niagara system that you create is actually going to be a collection of Niagara admitters.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Those admitters are actually a collection of dynamic input scripts, functions, and modules.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And those are further made up of Niagara asset tags, data channels, effects types, parameter collections,

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
parameter collection instances, definitions, simulation caches, and rules.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So you can see here that all of the things that you might work on inside of Niagara are actually created of bits of smaller VFX.

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So you can kind of think of Niagara as creating material instances but for VFX.

11
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now because Niagara is such a complex editor, when you go to create a new admitter,

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
you're going to be greeted with this wizard.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The wizard allows you to select template to get started from and it's also a great resource when you're learning

14
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because it's going to show you a bunch of different examples of things that you can create.

15
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now the Niagara editor is going to look similar to many of the other editors you used with the file menu across the top.

16
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And then one, much like with Blueprints and with the material editor, we have our save and our browse to asset and our compile.

17
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The thumbnail controls our thumbnail or this is what it's going to look like when viewed inside of the content browser.

18
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Our bounds shows us the rendering bounds, debug will show us debug information, simulation is for playing the simulation.

19
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Baker allows us to bake out this to a texture and scalability controls what is going to be turned on and turned off for our scalability.

20
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So again the menu bar here is very, very similar to what you've used in the past with other editors.

21
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Over here, two, this is going to be our preview window. This will show us the effect as we are building upon it.

22
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now three over here, this is going to be our parameters, user parameters and local modules.

23
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now out of this one, the one that we're going to use the most here is going to be user parameters and we'll cover those in just a little bit.

24
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Over here four, this is going to be our timeline, curves, Niagara log and script stats.

25
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now the timeline doesn't necessarily work in the way that you might be thinking.

26
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It doesn't actually control the parameters inside of here. Since this Niagara system can have multiple admitters in here,

27
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we can actually have different admitters and then control them through the timeline down here.

28
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Curves allow us to control the curves that we are working with.

29
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So if we have something that's going maybe from like an alpha from zero to one back to zero, we can look at that curves in the Curve Editor with more detail.

30
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Niagara log is going to show us the Niagara logs and the script stats are going to show us the stats of the whole system.

31
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Five is going to be our details panel. Now like with many of the other details panel in the editor, this is context sensitive.

32
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So what we have selected is going to change that.

33
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And then finally, six is our system overview and this is where we're going to be doing a majority of our work here.

34
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We can select each of these individual modules inside of this Niagara system right here.

35
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The details panels will populate with them and that is where we're going to do the work.

36
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So speaking of populating with it, the item that we're looking at here is called the stack.

37
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And the stack is basically where we interact with our particle.

38
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So you can see here we have an Admitter Summary, then we have our Admitter Spawn, our Admitter Update, and then our Particle Spawn, our Particle Update, and the Renderer.

39
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So the Admitter Spawn and the Admitter Update can be thought of as the things that get started.

40
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So this is what is going to start to admit all of our particles.

41
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then the Particle Spawn and the Particle Update can be thought of as well, this is what we're actually going to be seeing.

42
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And if you press, you can either collapse these by pressing this little triangle, or you can add different modules by pressing the plus sign next to each one of these stages.

43
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Once you do that, you're going to see this new module list come up and there are an awful lot of modules here.

44
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So keep that in mind that if you're looking for something to do with these, it's probably going to be there.

45
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You're probably going to need to search for it.

46
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In addition, each of the inputs you have here have the ability to be set up to either a parameter, or we can further implement something like an expression, or we can multiply them by a little formula or something like that.

47
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So we have a huge amount of control around our particles inside of Niagara.

48
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Now there is one other thing that I want to talk about that you might run into, and that is a lightweight admitter or a stateless admitter.

49
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You can have this type of admitter working with another Niagara admitter in the same Niagara.

50
00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And what the difference between this one and a standard Niagara admitter is that a lightweight admitter reduces the concurrent cost per tick, and in essence what it is is a reduced version of a particle system that is just the bare basics that is needed for it to run.

51
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So these are really good for things, maybe like a fire or an ambient smoke that doesn't need all of the various options that Niagara comes with.

52
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We just need something very simple.

53
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So we can add a lightweight admitter and then you'll see there'll be some parameters that we can add to it, but not as many as we normally would.

54
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So with that said, the next thing we're going to do is we are going to get into creating our first Niagara effect.
