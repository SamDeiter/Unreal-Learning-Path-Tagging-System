  "text": " Before we begin our class, we are going to take a look at our Blueprint. So let's go ahead and do that now. Now, first things first, Blueprint has a flow direction or a flow control. And this goes from left to right, just like you read in English. So if we start right here, our flow will always or execution will always go from here this way. And we will continue like that throughout our graph. Now, there are a few ways that we can control this flow. The most simplistic ways is going to be our branch or our if statement, which is right up here. This works with a condition. We have something that comes in here. And then based off this condition, we're going to have a true or a false. So if something comes in here, if it's true, it's going to fire off the execution off the true. If it's not true, it can fire the execution off of the false. We can also have this condition set to a variable, which will allow us to base the execution of this action off of other input in other areas of the project. Next, we have a flip flop. Flip flops are really cool because of how they work. They will always do one input and then the other. So when we get an input into a flip flop, we can always be assured that it will fire A and then B and keep repeating this pattern. These are really good if you would like to maybe do something on button click. And then when you click it again, it reverses that behavior or some other type of behavior that you know is going to have one output and then another output. Now, sequence nodes are useful and that they allow you to fire off execution to a bunch of different parts of your code all at one time. Now, you can add additional then pins in your sequence by pressing the add pin button right here. And again, this will fire off a bunch of different executions. It will do them in order that they come inside of the sequence. So it will go then zeros, then one, but there is no delay in the execution. They will always fire from the top and then go down to the bottom and fire off instantaneously. Next, we have the switch on int. So switch on int allows us to provide an integer or an input and then make a change based off of that. Switching on integer is a lot more useful than having to constantly remember the variable name or some other complicated name and simply having a number like one, two, three or four be able to change the output is super, super useful. Last but not least, we have a gate and a gate is used for executional based conditional checking. So if we are trying to check for some type of condition while we are executing a piece of code, we could use a gate to set up the structure for that. Now, we're not done just yet because blueprints also have a way to control time. Now you might be thinking, well, I could just make a timer. If I have full execution control, I could probably get the game time. And yes, you could do that. But there are some built in things that work way better. So first off, I want to talk about delays and retriggerable delays. Now, delays are a great little piece of code. If you want to wait for a specific amount of time. In fact, if you put a delay of zero, zero, that will act as a single frame delay inside of blueprints. And this is actually utilized in Fortnite as well as Robo Recall. Inside the Robo Recall mall, they actually will pause stuff on a single frame to do calculations. And again, if you take a delay node and you put that duration to zero, zero, it's that one frame delay that's often needed to help things spawn in without twitching. Now, there's also a retriggerable delay, which will re-trigger after a duration. The problem with these delays are these are kind of fire and forget nodes. Once we fire these off, we have no control over them. We just kind of have to wait for them. So we set it and we kind of wait for it to do its thing. And while that's good for many, many things, oftentimes that's not really good. We want precision. If we want precision, this is where the set timer by event and set timer by function name nodes come in real handy. With these two nodes, we can set them to listen for a specific event or a specific function and use this to help define how we keep track of time. One of the things to note on both of these nodes is both the time and the looping option. This allows us to basically create a timer of any duration, whether it's point one seconds or five hundred seconds. And we can even have that repeat some behavior on looping. So every time it counts maybe down for one second, we could have it loop and come back. So this is really going to work in our advantage as it's going to take a lot of the hard work of getting our game time, converting that game time into a real time that we could actually utilize to do things like keep track of our time. Super, super simple and makes everything much more approachable. Now, the last node that we're going to talk about here is a timeline. Now, a timeline is how you can animate objects inside of blueprints. Timelines will be added to the blueprint graph and they allow us to animate objects or properties of objects going from point A to point B in a linear fashion. While we aren't using timelines necessarily in this particular project, they are super useful to know about. All right, this will finish up our blueprints quick review. We'll now move on to Unreal motion graphics in our next video.",
