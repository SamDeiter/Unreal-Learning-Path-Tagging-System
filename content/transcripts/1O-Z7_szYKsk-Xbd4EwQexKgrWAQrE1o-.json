  "text": " Now that we've talked a little bit about inheritance and other object oriented concepts, I want to now move on about controllers and pawn classes. As these do slightly different things, but can be somewhat confusing at first. So the first thing that we're going to talk about is a controller class. Now the controller class is a digital representation of whatever physical input device is currently being used. So whether the player is using a mouse and a keyboard, a controller, a plastic guitar, an Arduino board, whatever they are using to send out input, that is going to be taken by our controller classes. Now there are two controller classes that you will see. There is the player controller and the AI controller. Now the AI controller is simply when you are trying to mimic input that a player would use. And it is kind of outside the scope of our talk. So that's about all we're going to talk about the AI controller. The player controller, on the other hand, is something that we are going to use and controllers do something called possession. And what they possess is something called the pawn. And when something is possessed, its inputs pass through the player controller down into the pawn, controlling it and displaying movement. So we can think of the player kind of like a spirit that controls an avatar. The reason that we want to do this is let's say that we have a game that supports multiple inputs. We have mouse and keyboard. We have a controller and this game also has multiple vehicle types. There is a human, there's a horse, there's a car, there's a helicopter. However, what we want to have happen is that whenever a player is playing on the mouse and keyboard, whenever they go to press forward, no matter if they're a horse or a car or a tractor or a rocket ship, we always want W to make them go forward, A to make them go left, D to make them go right and S to go backwards. And by establishing our movements and things inside of our player controller, what we do is we allow our players to use the same movement components and the same movement inputs, no matter what type of pawn they're having to be possessing. Now you might be wondering, well, you keep talking about this thing called pawn. What is a pawn? Well, a pawn is just simply a class that takes the input passed from the user or the AI and takes that movement and processes it into the actual movement and interaction that you're seeing on the screen. Now, when you're dealing with pawn, you're going to see two kind of subclasses. There's a pawn and there is a character class. The difference between the two is that pawn is a simple, basically kind of like a ghost that will float in the world and collide with objects. The character class, though, that gives us a more advanced movement. It gives us a capsule component and a skeletal mesh component that represents the visual representation of that. Generally speaking, all character monsters and vehicles will derive from either pawn or the character class, depending on what it's used for. And again, it's best to keep things split up in this manner where we have our controller controlling our various pawns, as this will ensure that we don't have to have code in multiple locations and that the end user isn't surprised whenever a new mechanic is introduced or they utilize a new type of vehicle.",
