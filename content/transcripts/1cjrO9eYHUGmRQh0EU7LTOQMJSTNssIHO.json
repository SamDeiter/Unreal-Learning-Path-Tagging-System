  "text": " Let's start by looking at Datasmith Interruptibility. So when we're looking at data preparation, clean up is the key here. So when we're thinking about real time rendering, it has constraints such as the data format, model and scene optimization, and then the conversion of properties such as geometry, material lighting, animation, those kind of assets. So we also need to think about the different purposes when we were approaching data preparation. So if you're looking for the end result to be game data, the final production is game related. On the AEC data front, your final aim there is construction. And then when using CAD, final aim is manufacturing. So thinking about these different purposes will be key when thinking about preparing your data. And then also the fully constructed scenes in CAD and DCC apps need the preservation of scene hierarchies and pivot points. When looking at the Datasmith import export options, then we have the difference between DCC and CAD. So we have dedicated exporters and native files for each. So DCC applications require special Datasmith exporters. So Datasmith is saved as a scene and that file extension is a U Datasmith file. And then the DCC models are saved as UD mesh files. Textures are then saved with the original type. So JPEG, PNG, whatever you're saving as there. And then the DCC importer converts all of these assets into a U asset file, which is the Unreal asset file. Whereas in the CAD application, you don't need a exporter there. The CAD files are natively read by Datasmith and CAD imports converts CAD surfaces into polymeshes. And then the CAD importer converts CAD surfaces and models into U assets. To get your exporter for the required application, they can be downloaded from the Unreal Engine site. So if you just follow that URL there, the download page can also be found on the marketplace. But whichever approach you take, we have all the dedicated exporters in a section here. So you can find the one that's related to your list in this respect. And then the FBX special cases when exporting your data, you just want to look out for the special case applications such as VRED and DeltaGen. So VRED requires a manual installation of the plugin and the FBX plugin needs to be manually activated in Unreal Engine 5. So you'll see that we've got this Datasmith FBX importer here. And you just go to the editor window, go to edit, go down to plugins and find the Datasmith FBX importer from the list and just enable that. You'll probably have to restart your editor if it wasn't previously enabled. And then another point to note is that the DeltaGen plugin offers to simplify the hierarchy at import time. So you may want to opt out of this default here, this tick box, as it can mess up the hierarchy that you presumably worked very hard to create there. Mea currently isn't supported by Datasmith straight out of the box, but we still have a workaround for the Mea Datasmith workflow. And you can get a third party plugin from the following link there. And then you can install the plugin that fits your installed Mea version. You can save your exported file and then you're ready to import the file into Unreal using Datasmith. So then go over the workaround for Mea users. So we want to first make sure the Datasmith is set to accept the files. So based on the template you start with, you may or not have these plugins enabled. But if you again just go to edit and then down to plugins, type in Datasmith in the search box and you'll see these three plugins that are the plugins that you need to have enabled. So once you've enabled those, you can restart the editor for them to take effect. And then the option becomes available for importing files directly into the engine or when using data prep. To provide a visual representation of how this Datasmith is processed, we've got the DCC applications, the Datasmith export plugin on the top left hand side here, which exports it as the U Datasmith file type, which we mentioned previously. So you've got your your mesh and JPEGs, PNGs, things like this. Whereas anything maybe more CAD related, you have your native file format saved as their individual file types. And then Datasmith will then handle the importer over into Unreal Engine. So the Datasmith, the software is above that will create its own file types. The software is below that will create native file formats. And then Datasmith will handle that. So then Datasmith is core is a set of assets in the content browser. And these are all U assets. So as soon as we get inside of Unreal Engine, Unreal Engine has converted these to U assets and then they become the actors in the level. So to give you a typical workflow here, we translate data and filter on the import, heal and stitch surfaces. So you generate static meshes and control the mesh density. Then you remove hidden objects. We flatten hierarchies and jacket them. Then you flip the faces, add material elements, remove holes and bumps. We then merge proxy and create level of details and then material UV generation and variance to get the visual representation back up to standard.",
