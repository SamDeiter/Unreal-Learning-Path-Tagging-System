  "text": " Modules are the individual elements that make up an Unreal codebase. They're the kind of building blocks that you can stitch everything together from the code side to make an Unreal project. There's a couple of reasons why you might want to introduce a module. One of them is if you have components of code that you only want introduced in particular targets such as only in a shipping version of the game, only in the editor, only on a client, only on a server, etc. And that's for whole sections of code. The other reason might be that your project is so large that you start to get really long link times. So modules are a way to break that up to say not all of this code needs to link to all of this other code. You can kind of break it up in that way. And the last point is that modules make your code more reusable. It's a kind of way to chop up a section of functionality that you could then port to another project very easily because you know it's relatively self-contained. So what actually is in an Unreal project? The project at the very least consists of a single module, which is known as the primary gameplay module and is essentially your entry point for your XE. And that primary gameplay module can then link to the other modules it needs depending on what kind of functionality it wants. It's important to highlight as well that when you're building for editor, each of the modules that your project has are built as individual DLLs. Whereas when you're doing a shipping version of the game, each of those modules will get combined into one gigantic XE. So if I were to just quickly demonstrate this, we can see here this is the example project that I've made. And if I went into our binaries, Win64, we can see here we've got a individual DLL for our example 55 project and our example 55 project editor. And the reason for that is I've gone ahead and just made an example little secondary module here for our editor project. I'll go into that in a little bit more detail later, but it's just to kind of highlight that those things are made as separate DLLs when you're doing the editor build. So if we kind of think about a way of structuring an example here, a slightly contrived example might be that we have an FPS game and we decide we want to break this up into modules to make it more reusable. So we could have a guns module and then a grenades module. And both of these could then rely on the projectiles module. The advantage of this is it means that we can take guns, we can take grenades, and we can take projectiles all independently of each other and use them in other projects. So our guns would then need to include our projectiles because both guns and grenades rely on this projectiles module. So they would both need to rely on it. But it just makes the whole thing more portable. We can take projectiles without the other two. If we wanted to bring guns alone, we would need to bring projectiles with it because it depends on it. But it just means everything can be kind of chopped and moved around. The one thing to highlight here is if we kind of look at the visual flow, we can see everything is coming out of our primary game module, FPS game being our primary game module. And we need to be a little bit careful about circularity of code here. So we don't want to avoid circular references here. So we should be very careful about modules linking back up this chain. Guns and grenades shouldn't be linking back to FPS game DLL if they really can't help it. And projectiles shouldn't be linking back to guns because it massively increases the chance that you're going to get circular references. Especially as a kind of general working practice, very few, if anything, should be linking back to our primary game module. We should really be thinking about our primary game module as the end of chain, as our kind of like, yeah, an end of that inclusion chain. And nothing really should be including that. The one exception I can think of is sometimes when you're using an editor module for your game, that's possibly a case where you might want to include that. But that's even there. If you can avoid it, that's a good thing. So when talking about a module, the kind of minimum thing that a module needs to be, how it's defined, is three things, really. We have the working directory. So typically in the engine, this would be the most common case for modules that you would already see inside Unreal or inside source runtime. I'll just quickly jump to that example. When you're in an Unreal C++ project, you can see we've got it split up between our engine here and our game. If we go to our source and runtime section, we have a few different sections, but the one with the most in it is our runtime. And you can see each of these is a module. So they have their own working directory. If we were just to open up application core, you can see this is clearly a module because it's got its own build.cs file, which is another component. And then it's got all the source files for that module inside there. So we have the actual working directory, so a folder to contain our module. Then we have the build.cs, which I just quickly showed before, which we'll go into a little bit more detail in a second. And then finally, we have just a class, a CPP file that actually represents the module itself, where we kind of implement that module. So looking a bit more at the build.cs file, this has two, it has a couple of different things we can introduce into it. But most importantly is these two arrays of public dependency module names and private dependency module names. We can look at our primary gameplay module here. And if we jump inside here, we can see public dependency module names. This is by default. Whenever you make a new Unreal Engine project, it will already have a primary gameplay module. It'll already have a build.cs. And this build.cs will come with these four modules being relied on. It will be very, very difficult to create an Unreal Engine game not using these. So they're just in there by default. And so we have the public dependency module names and private dependency module names. The distinction between these two is a little bit important. Essentially it means that a public dependency module name is where anything that your module openly relies on. So when other modules are including this one, these are modules that those modules will know you rely on. Public dependency module names are really what we should be trying to use as much as possible. It's not exposing our use of those modules in the same way. It's a little bit more something you'd be needing to rely on when you're doing more engine based modules. You'll see that typically within your gameplay module, you don't have a division. Unreal doesn't create an automated division of public and private here. It kind of just treats most of the primary gameplay module as private by default. But if you look towards any module inside Unreal Engine's code base itself, you'll see you'll get this public and private division here. And that's when your private dependency module names and your public dependency module names become a little bit more important. But just generally, I suppose the process should be try to use private as much as you can unless something needs to be public. So when it actually comes to creating a module, we can't just put the build CS in, put our module CPP in and expect the code to get detected and compiled and linked. Otherwise that would be the same as saying we're building and compiling all Unreal Engine's code all the time, which we obviously don't want to do. So there's a couple of steps beyond just making a module to actually connect it to our game. First and foremost, we need to actually link it to our primary gameplay module. This is the most common way of doing it. Or any module that our primary gameplay module is using. So as you can see here again in our primary gameplay module's build CS, we can just add that to a dependent module. So our core, core U object, engine and input core here are going to be getting compiled and then linked. Any modules that aren't included there, the compiler isn't even going to think about because we're essentially saying I'm not trying to use these for this project. The other thing that we can do is add our modules to a target CS. This is slightly less common, but it's really important and powerful and it's an important thing to understand. So whenever you make an Unreal Engine project for the first time, you'll come with a primary gameplay module and you'll come with two of these target CS files. These essentially correlate with the different build targets that we can have. So our example 55 project dot target CS is used whenever we do debug game, development or shipping. And our 55 project editor target CS is used whenever we're doing an editor target, right? It covers our editor targets. So debug game editor and development editor. So essentially these target CSs let us highlight modules that we want to use when we're building that particular target. So when we're creating our normal project target, we obviously need to include the primary gameplay module. But when we're building for editor, we can additionally include editor only targets. So this wouldn't come in by default. This is something I've actually made myself. These two target CSs are in there by default, but I have additionally just to kind of demonstrate this added an editor module that would, you know, in a normal gameplay scenario, you might add in some developer tools, some additional editor functionality. So I've added this 55 project editor. I've included that in our module names so that when we're building the editor target, we want to include this module. And then if we quickly glimpse into this module build CS, we can see I've added my 55 project as a public dependency. Again, something we should be trying to avoid when we can, but I'm just imagining that our editor, it's quite likely we would need access to particular actors we've defined inside our gameplay module or something like that. But for the most part, you should be trying to avoid this so that we don't end up with circular dependencies. But because our primary gameplay module doesn't depend on our editor module, that's not going to be likely. And then we've got our CPP. And this is where we actually implement the module ourselves. Now the other element that gets included and should be borne in mind is the fact that we have whenever we're creating an editor module, the way you do that is we have something, we need a class that inherits from a module interface. And that brings with it the functionality to highlight this startup and shutdown module. By default, most modules you see in Unreal Engine will have this. You still have a module header and it inherits from module interface. You don't actually need to do that. If you want a very, very minimal implementation of a module, you can actually only have the CPP. And you can use this minimal implementation here where you say implement module and you just use this F default module implementation, where if we jump to that, you can see that's just an empty class that inherits from I module interface in the module manager header. So if you really, really don't need much control over what happens on startup and shutdown of your module, you can use this. But the vast majority of the time you would have, you would define a module class, inherit from your module interface, and then that gives you access to a startup module and a shutdown module functionality. So once we've actually created the module, the next step that we need to do is talk about how is this module used by our project? When does it get loaded and what type of module is it? The place that you define these is inside your project's U project file. So I'll just quickly jump to that and show, but we'll come back to this in a second in a bit more detail. But if I just go to our example five five project, you can see I've got my U project file here. This is actually just a JSON under the hood. So if I open this up with either notepad plus plus or any text editing software, really, we can see this is what our U project file looks like. We've got an engine version here. We've got some description and category stuff. But the kind of key thing we're talking about here is this modules array. This is what we really need to worry about here. And you can see we've got our primary gameplay module. The names here are important. They need to match up with the actual name we use for that module. And then we define a type for that module. So this is a runtime one and we've got our editor module here, which is editor, and we define a load phase. So a couple of the options we have available to us when we're talking about what type of module it is and how when it loads, the default, the kind of most common ones would be an editor module, which again is loaded when we are doing an editor target, a runtime module. We also have developer tool, which is similar to an editor target, but it's defined. It's tied particularly to something inside our target CS, which is this B developer build developer tools ball. When that's set to true, that means that this module will get included. That can be useful when you're doing something that you don't want to bring the whole editor with it, but you do need some set of developer tools that you definitely don't want to go into the shipping game. That's a case where you might not have, it might not be an editor, but it might be a developer tool. And then we have server only and client only targets. And that would be pretty self explanatory. It's when you want sets of modules that would only go into the server or only into the client. An example might be you might have all your UI in a module and then obviously your server doesn't need UI, so you don't include any of that code. The second thing is this load phases. Again some typical examples would be just before the loading screen of the game, the default loading phase, which is kind of in the middle of the engine booting up, and then post engine in it. Post engine in it is very, very common for editor because you want your entire engine to be loaded in before you start injecting additional functionality on top. So again, coming back to, this is just another preview of a U project. We've got the name of the modules we were using, this type is some examples we just ran through, and our loading phase again some examples we just ran through. This isn't a full comprehensive list. If you actually wanted to see all of those, you can go to the, if I just quickly jump to the file, it's module descriptor dot H, and in here we have a full list of all the loading phases and all the host types, which is our module types. So if you want to see all the options available to you, you can just jump into the module descriptor header to take a look at those. The other thing to highlight is that modules aren't just to be completely independent of your code base, right? Sometimes it's not just injecting functionality, but once you've included that module as something that your module depends on, you want actual access to that module. And that can be, modules can be accessed relatively easily through this function, the F module manager and load module checked. So a typical example and one that I've personally used quite a lot is the asset registry module from the engine. So the way you might access that is through this function, F module manager, load module checked, then we use the module class type, so in this case F asset registry module, and then we provide this string here. This isn't just an internal name that we give to it, this tallies with what we use in our implement module macro, which is typically done inside your module CPP. So in the case of our editor, it's the second one here, it's implement module is this important macro to say, you know, this module exists, you say which class it's using and here's the name that you then refer to this module by. So example five five project editor. In the case of our game, it's the same thing, our primary gameplay module, if we go to our primary gameplay module CPP, we use this implement primary game module macro, and it's this term here that we, if we for some reason needed to access our primary gameplay module, it would be using this term here. So that is what you need to provide in this string here if you want to access that module. What this means is that you can essentially create a module that is just a library of functionality. If you just needed some extra functions to, for example, download some files or provide some HTTP functionality or something like that, your module doesn't need to bring in a whole lot of different things, a whole load of different classes, it could literally just be a single CPP file with some helper functions in it, and then you could access that through this load module checked. Moving on from modules, but still thinking about that kind of portability that they bring, we can kind of zoom out a little bit and look at plugins. Plugins are similar to modules in that they are separated from our initial project, but they bring a kind of a couple of extra features to them. So one of the key things that a plugin has to it is it can be made up of multiple modules. If we think about something like, imagine I've got some advanced 3D pathfinding functionality, so I've got something like a navmesh, but it's a 3D navmesh, then that's clearly going to have like a runtime and an editor component. It's going to have the actual runtime navmesh, but when I'm interacting with an editor, I want some editor functionality. So that would be a case where that plugin would have two modules. We would have the kind of core module that provides that 3D navmesh, and then we would have an editor module because we don't want all of this editor functionality getting exported into the shipping build of our game, so we need multiple modules. If that's the case, a plugin is definitely something that you should be considering, and it brings all that extra capability. The other thing about advantage of plugins is that it's got a very nice editor implementation. You can just very easily look up all the plugins available to you through your Unreal Engine, through the Edit Plugins tab. I'll just quickly demonstrate that actually. If I jump to our example project, just here, Edit, Plugins, and you can see all the plugins available to you, and you'll see a bunch of them come enabled by default. It's actually worth just taking a little look through this in your own time to see, because there's whole sets of features here that you might never know existed until you start browsing through this. But you can see these are the kind of built-in plugins that come with the engine. Again, not all of these, or a lot of these, in fact, won't be enabled by default, so it's worth looking through them. But you can also install plugins to your engine for additional functionality, so those would be listed here. The last thing about taking this kind of portability idea further is that when you make a plugin, it makes it very easy to not just bring it from project to project internally, but it also means you can put it on the marketplace, either for money or for free. So Fab is the kind of new marketplace for not just Unreal stuff, but also I think they have Unity and another software on there. And yes, basically turning something into a plugin makes it very easy to host up here. And it also is worth bearing in mind that when you're thinking about a new set of features, it's possible that someone already has provided that on Fab, and that might just save you a lot of development time. So just something worth bearing in mind when you're considering plugins, that the Fab marketplace is there, you might be able to put that plugin up there, or find something and save some time. So when actually talking about creating a plugin, it's very, very simple. If you want to make your new one from scratch, the easiest way is just to go to your plugins folder, plugins window, and you can see you've just got this add button in the top left here. If we open that up, we've got a couple of options here for what kind of plugin this is going to be. You can say where you want that to go, and then you can just define some basic information about it, about who's authoring this, what's the description of this plugin. And once you go to create plugin, it will go through a process, it will take a couple of minutes and it will create a new one. But then you'll get something, your plugin will be created for you, and you'll get something a little bit like this. So your plugins don't go into your source folder, they actually live alongside your project in their own folder. When you create a new Unreal project for the first time, this plugin folder won't exist until you try creating a plugin for that project. If you want to pull some plugins in, you can just make this folder yourself, but this will get automatically generated. So this is an example plugin that I made. It has no content really, but it's just to kind of show you the breakdown of it. You'll notice that it looks quite a lot like our actual project. It's got its own source folder, it's got its own content folder, it's got an intermediate folder, a binaries folder. The distinction is you know a plugin when you see it because it doesn't have a U project file, it has a U plugin file. The other thing to highlight as well is it's got this resources folder. By default, this will just have this one thing in it, which is the icon, and this is essentially what's displayed in engine. So if we actually go and look, you can see my example plugin, this is the icon. If I were to replace this, if I were to replace the icon here, that's what would come up on the editor. Yeah, so if we just quickly look at the plugin file, we can see very, very similar to our U project, some file versioning, what version this plugin actually is, if this is going to go up in the marketplace, it would have a URL, some support information, and then what modules this plugin uses. So very much like the U project, a plugin can have multiple modules to it, and this works in exactly the same way as the U project. Yeah, this is where we define the module's name, and then what type of module it is in its loading phase.",
