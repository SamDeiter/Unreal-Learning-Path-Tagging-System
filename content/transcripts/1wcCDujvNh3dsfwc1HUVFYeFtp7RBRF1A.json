  "text": " Hey there. So in the last video, we were talking about the apply additive node. This time we will be looking at the blend node and the blend node it's used to mix two full body animations to create an entirely new animation. So I would say we're not accessorizing animations anymore. I would say pretend you're an artist mixing colors on a paint palette. So if you combine red and blue, you get an entirely new color purple. Or if you're familiar with Photoshop or compositing, the blend node is also like the A over B operation with an alpha value to control which of the two animations is more dominant. So let's hop into Unreal. I'm just going to go back to the third person and MVP. And first thing I'm going to do is unhook this wires. I'm going to alt click and move down the output pose. So we can move and work down here. So I'm going to right click in an empty space. I'm going to type in blend and it's really easy. It's the one that says blend underneath the blends category. So click on that and let me connect these two nodes and hit compile. And let me rotate our character a bit. And as you can see, he is in an A pose because we are blending nothing with nothing. And so it's doing exactly what we are telling it to do. To make this more interesting, we can drag the green third person idle animation, not to be confused with the orange blend space. I would say the green third person idle animation and just drag that on the A. Wait for the green checkbox. There you go. And then release and then third person walk. I would put that on the B channel and I'll just spread the different animations a little bit apart so I can see them easier and I'll hit compile. And now our character is completely doing the idle animation because the alpha value is set to zero. If I change it to one and then compile, we only see the walk animation. But if I change the alpha to 0.5 and then compile one more time, we get this 50-50 blend, which looks kind of amusing. And it's this whole new animation asset because we blended these two animations. And there's also some visual cues going on. If I zoom in, I'm just going to control middle mouse a little bit. Control middle mouse to get in a little bit more. Watch the visual cues with these wires. So if I change alpha to zero and then compile this wire, it got thicker and it's 100% white. And if I change the alpha to one, we're going to see it change. So now the B wire is thicker, it's white. And if I change alpha to 0.5, they both have medium thickness and they're both a little bit gray. And so just with a glance, you can understand what's going on. Now another visual indicator is the little timeline bars. So under here, each of these animation clips have a timeline bar and they're moving at different rates. So that tells me that the walk animation has fewer frames than the idle animation because it's not taking as long for this walk animation to cycle through. And I could click on the third person walk node right here and I can look at the context sensitive details panel and change some of these attributes. I could make the play rate twice as fast. I could change it to two and compile. And then he's moving a bit faster. I find that kind of amusing. And then if I change the play rate to 0.5 so that it's half speed and I compile, we get this slow motion effect. So this would be for your epic walk scene. There's an explosion in the background kind of thing, right? I'm going to compile and save. There we go. Now you might be wondering, what if I want to mix together more than two animations? Can I do that? And the answer is yes. And that's what we will talk about in the next video.",
