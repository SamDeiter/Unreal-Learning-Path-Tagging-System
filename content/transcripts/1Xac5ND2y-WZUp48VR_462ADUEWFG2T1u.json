  "text": " If you're trying to execute code whilst the players are actually interacting with the world instead of before, then you need to go to the Event Graph. The Event Graph is executing while the game is actually loading, or while your project is actually running. The Event Graph starts with a few nodes already created. BeginPlay, then ActorBeginOverlap, and EventTick. All of these are very commonly used. You might not need them at all, and you could just delete them at the beginning, or you might find they're actually helpful to have around. The first node is EventBeginPlay. This event is fired the first time the actor is created within the world. This could either be when the level is first loaded, or when the actor is spawned into the level. The next node is the Event or ActorBeginOverlap. This is what is referred to as a collision to list. This event is going to be triggered whenever any of the components of this actor overlap with any other actor. You can see here, as well as the standard white one, this event also has a blue pin below it. This will allow us access to information about the actor that has been collided with. So this node is essentially triggered whenever something bumps into it. The last node is EventTick. Standardly, this will fire on every frame of the game. This is really useful if you need something to be constantly updated or checked. However, if you add too much code here, it can slow down your game. Tick does not necessarily have to fire on each frame. You can change this by going to class defaults, and then in the section for ActorTick, you can set the tick interval. It is set to zero as default. This will mean that it will fire on every frame, but you could slow it down by entering any interval in seconds.",
