  "text": " Okay, let's wrap up our discussion on sequencer features and tools by exploring Sequencer Tools Enhancements. These are just a few of the various tools that can be used to enhance your workflow that integrate or utilize Sequencer. The first is Take Recorder. Take Recorder is an integrated recording tool that allows for you to record gameplay animation, live performances, Niagara simulations, works with the VCam toolset to create and record camera work and other sources such as performance capture tools directly into Unreal Engine. Recordings can then be managed by Sequencer, cleaned up or adjusted and then that allows users to achieve a highly iterative workflow. Next is one of those tools, Live Link Face and MetaHuman Animator. MetaHuman Animator and Live Link Face work together to create facial performances for any actor that you are created that use the Apple AR Kit. What is required for this to work is a computer running Unreal Engine, the MetaHuman plugin installed and enabled which is available in the marketplace, a vertical stereo head mounted camera system or the Apple iPhone X and later. It is recommended though that you use the iPhone 12 because the iPhone 12 does have a superior true depth camera component. iPhone 13 and later have a less sophisticated true depth camera but it does still work quite well. You also need to have the Live Link Face app installed and an iOS device that has that functionality. Those are available on the Apple App Store for free. Additionally, we have the Live Link Virtual Camera. The Live Link Virtual Camera is a tool that allows for virtual cinematography work. There are two options for this to work. The Live Link VCam app and the Unreal Remote 2 app. Both apps are free in the Apple Store. You also need a computer that runs Unreal Engine and an Apple iPad Pro or iPhone X and later with the Live Link VCam or Unreal Mountain 2 app installed. Optionally, you can also use the Nintendo Joy-Con controllers that can be used for camera and that works with any of the Apple systems running iOS 16 and later. There is also an alternative right now called the Virtual Camera Virtual App that is an Android alternative for buy-owls. This is a stripped down version similar to the Epic Games Live Link VCam and it is available in the Epic Games Marketplace or in the Play Store. I want to note that this is not a free plugin. Again, this is not a free plugin. It's about $80 and if you wait just a little bit longer, you will find that there will be an alternative that has been announced on our public roadmap so that the Live Link VCam will be available for Android soon. There are also some additional tools with one of our partners from the Praxinos group and those are Epos and Iliad. Epos is a tool that uses Sequencer for visualization. With Epos, the Unreal Engine Sequencer is transformed into a powerful visualization tool that is used in several ways including storyboard creation, storyboard import and timing, animatic creation and editing, previs blending of 2D and CG elements for hybrid animation, final pixel hybrid animation or 2D visual effects. One thing to note here, Iliad and Epos are free to use plugins that are found in the Unreal Engine Marketplace. That other tool, Iliad, is a digital painting and animation tool. Iliad provides a dedicated interface to create and edit textures directly within the engine. It eliminates the need for a workflow involving additional DCC packages, but it is not as robust as current DCC packages. Still, I would recommend giving it a try. You might find that you enjoy working with this tool. Iliad can be used from many ways including traditional 2D animation flipbooks, sprite animation, traditional 2D animation effects, creating or editing 2D texture assets, texture painting on static mesh assets or skeletal mesh assets, storyboards in conjunction with Epos, sketch, design or illustration. Now I also want to note that Praxinos does offer a paid application called Odyssey. Odyssey will be available at a later time and it integrates both of these tools in order to create a true 2D animation toolset built on Unreal Engine. It utilizes a reskinning of the Unreal Engine to create a full 2D animation tool. Again, it is a paid application unlike Unreal Engine, which is a free application. So that's it for this section. Next we're going to move into our hands-on for shot creation and assembly.",
