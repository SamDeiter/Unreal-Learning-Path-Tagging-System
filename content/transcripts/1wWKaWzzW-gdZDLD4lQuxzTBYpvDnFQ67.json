  "text": " In addition to speed, we also want to add time, which is another type of input. So below it, by right clicking on the grid, we can add time. We can search for and add a time node. And we'll tie these two together with a multiply. Click on the grid, hold down the M key and left click to get multiply. And pipe the speed into the A channel, time into the B channel. And we'll take the results of this. I'm going to move all of these over a little bit by marquee selecting them and dragging them to the left and then taking the result of our time speed functions and piping them into the time pin of each of the pattern nodes. Cool, cool. OK, so now we've taken care of the speed and position of our maps. Now we need to add our maps. So we're going to be using really just one map for all of these, and we will add it by. Bringing it through another function input so that the function input is in control. And for that, we will on the grid with the grid selected, right click and. Type in function input. It helps to spell. Properly function input. And again, we're working with not three vectors, but two, and this is a little more specialized than just a two vector. Will specifically we're specifically going to be adding a texture and there's an input type specifically for that function input texture 2D. And if we label this as texture, it will appear in the resulting material function that we use later. So we'll call it type in its. In its details, input name texture. And. To do that's interesting. And we'll. Turn on use preview value as default. Also, this isn't necessary, but it can be helpful to set a sort priority on this node as one isn't strictly necessary, it can help. Function input texture 2D. OK, that should be right. And next we'll need a texture object, not a texture sample, but a texture object. We don't want all this other information. We only want the raw texture to be fed through this input function. So for that on the grid, right click and search for texture object. And that's giving us just just the map, nothing else. And we'll want to use a normal map. We could be sort of. Well, not every textual work, but normal maps actually work best because they they have the right type of information, the right. Number of channels of information. So we'll use a base normal map. Let's see if it comes up with base. Tile. Base tile normal. Yeah, this is it. This is good. And we'll take that texture feed it through the feed it into the preview. And then the. The output from the texture 2D into each of the texture sample nodes. So the next step is to take our animation. Panners. Take the coordinates and feed the coordinates into each of the texture sample UVs. I'm going to move the result node over so that we have some room to stack these effects together to boil them down, so to speak, into the output node. And to do that we'll need some ads will need actually are two ads. Call down the A key and left click. One ad for the top to one ad for the bottom to another ad to tie these two together. Take the RGB from the top sampler putting a second sampler into be for the bottom to the same thing. And then we'll take the results of each of these ads and pipe them into the one ad to rule them all. And then we'll take one more input function to control the overall effect the combined effect of this whole thing. So for that, we will click on the grid and right click and add another function input. And then will be a scalar input. So, a single value really. So from the input type menu in the details. We'll choose the top option. Input scalar. We'll name it divisor. We'll turn on preview value as default, and we'll set the first value to be not one but something a little smaller than that a divisor point to five. And to tie the ad, and this divisor together will use a multiply. Click on the grid. Hold down the M key left click to add a multiply. And we'll pipe the ad into the a divisor into the D. And then pipe the multiply into the output function. And we'll turn on preview. And now we have a completed material function, animating and giving us just the results that we're looking for certain amount of chaos that suggests like caustics will apply this and save it. Pretty cool. Now to use this material function to create these caustics will need to create a material. A material that will be using will be applying, we're going to apply a material to a light, as we have here. So in the content browser. Right click to create a new material. And we'll call this new material. M underscore caustics. Enter. So, with this selected double click to open it. And we have our blank material editor. Not totally blank actually. And the first thing we'll do is we'll take our material function wave and F wave and drag it into our material editor. And we have this material function this this massive tool that we just built, and we have access to what it will do in our new material. So with this, we'll need to use a texture and coordinate system for controlling it. And then feed it through our material function. So texture coordinates are controlled with the texture coordinate node, which you may recall, if you click on the grid and hold down the T key is brought up by holding down the, I'm sorry not the T key but the UK, and left clicking, and we have our texture coordinates. To that will add a scalar parameter. And we can do that by holding down the S key and left clicking. And we can just call that parameter. You can adjust it if you want to or. It's not something we're going to adjust here. We'll set a default value to this of one. Works out of the box will tie those together with a multiply hold down the M key and left click and pipe the coordinates into the a channel, and the one parameter into the B channel. And we'll pipe the results of these two nodes into coordinates, where's coordinates there's coordinates. Depending upon how you build your material function, these can show up in a slightly different order. Yours may not look exactly the same as mine. We'll need another texture object, not a texture sampler, but a texture object, because this is going to be controlling it we don't need the other. The other information that comes with, with a texture sampler. So we'll right click and search texture object. And we'll look for an appropriate texture to throw will be called. What's the caustics. T caustic software. There we go. And we'll pipe that into our texture. The last thing to do is to change our output node so that it will be something that can be used by a light, rather than a rather than by a surface. And so to do that we're basically going to end up turning off all of these options. The only one that we're really interested in is a missive missive color. So to do that, we will change the material domain in its details will go from surface to light function. And the shading model default lit is just fine. So we'll take the results of our material function and everything it contains and pipe that into a missive color. And we have caustics. Pretty cool. We'll apply this and save it. Now to see it actually work. All right. So let's, let's move out a bit. And why have a lighter. It's interesting. I may have a light already in place. So we're going to pull in another light so in our place actor. Choose lights. Find a spotlight. And I'm going to move this out of the way. So spotlight mind. So spotlight is that partial that softly lit light. Anyway, we'll use spotlight nine, and we'll play with eight if we need to. In it's spotlight. We see that there's a slot for light function material. So we'll take our caustics material and drag it into light function and release it. It's connected, and we can see that the light is throwing caustics. Pretty amazing. So if you have a light in your room or a pool of water nearby you would say that the caustics are coming from the water. And we can change the direction of this we can do all sorts of things. So there you have it. So that's our first material function.",
