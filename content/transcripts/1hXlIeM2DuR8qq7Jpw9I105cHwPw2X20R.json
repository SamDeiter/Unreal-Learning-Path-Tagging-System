  "text": " Okay, now that we've discussed legacy production and real-time tool sets, what does the production pipeline look like if we add real-time tools into the legacy production pipeline? So the first thing that can change in the real-time animation studio pipeline is the way story development works. Instead of being cut off from production, the story can be blocked out in Unreal Engine by using the free storyboard plugins Epos and Iliad from the Praxnos Co-op group. This can be used to generate storyboards and create a real-time story reel or animatic. This first change can drive faster scene assembly, concurrent modeling, rigging, and surfacing, and lead production through a more collaborative and dynamic production process. In this graph, there are two colors. Teal represents the traditional DCC application supplying a solution for product for each of the needs or stages in production, while purple represents supplementing Unreal Engine in place of that DCC. And when this chart looks more complicated, it's actually pretty similar to the traditional pipeline, except that now there's real-time interaction where that is critical for faster production. Now everything works together to create the sequence assemblies in Sequencer. Ideas can be tried out, iterated, and either kept or discarded depending on what best serves the narrative direction. Performance can be captured in the Engine, adjusted and polished by animators, and cinematographers working together with the director in real-time don't even need to be in the same room as projects can be accessed remotely by staff. Performances don't necessarily need to be finished before some of the shot enhancements are implemented as well. The departments can pass shots around or work in parallel to achieve near-final renders or a complete and more simplified final edit that doesn't have to wait for everything to be perfect and now allows for a faster revision process. This leads us to the strengths and weaknesses of integrating a real-time production pipeline. As we discussed, the story development process is better integrated into production and as a result, shot construction can feel more like a live-action shot creation as the director can be more involved in the entire process thanks to Sequencer acting as the production hub. Since Unreal Engine's editorial tool Sequencer now serves as the production hub, the revision process led by the director becomes more interactive. End results from Unreal Engine can be exported or rendered at final pixel levels and overall the entire pipeline becomes unified and more collaborative thanks to real-time integration. There's also extensive features that are available to allow Unreal Engine to be integrated more easily into your existing pipeline so you don't have to scrap everything and start from new. The hope is that by having several paths to integration like using Datasmith, Python scripting, support for FBX, USD, Alembic, and GLTF, these options will allow for better incorporation of Unreal Engine in a way that can be non-disruptive to existing workflows. The idea is that you can either build a new pipeline from the ground up with Unreal Engine at the core of your workflows or have Unreal Engine take over in the areas that benefit your pipeline for enhanced efficiencies. All while serving as a single source for aggregation of your project and asset data from multiple sources. For example, taking landscape data from Rhino, buildings from Revit, assets from Max, Maya, or even SketchUp Pro all coming together inside Unreal Engine. And that's it for this section. In our next section, let's look at how Unreal Engine can help manage your data.",
