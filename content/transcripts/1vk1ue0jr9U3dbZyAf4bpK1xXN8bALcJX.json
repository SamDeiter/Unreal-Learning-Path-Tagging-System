  "text": " In this section, we're going to talk about using Datasmith as our importer. Now, if you're familiar at all with the typical workflow for importing assets into Unreal Engine, you'll know that the majority of the time, you use things like FBX, which is a file format. Now, FBX is great. It works awesome. It's cool. But we've also got this great tool called Datasmith. Datasmith is designed to bring entire pre-constructed scenes and complex assemblies into your project. So this is extremely helpful, especially when we're talking about automotive data. Now, the Audi vehicle that we're using in here was exported via Datasmith. So let's talk about how we do that process and what you need to have set up with your project, as well as your DCC apps, to make that work. So the way that Datasmith will work is that you will still use your external DCC programs, like 3ds Max, Rhino, SolidWorks, CADs, etc., to author and create your assets. Once you install the Datasmith plugin onto your machine, it will enable a export setting preset inside of those applications, to which then you would just select your assets and you would export and export as a U Datasmith file. From that, we were going to use the Datasmith plugin inside of our engine to be able to ingest that information. So again, the two pieces that we're gonna need here are the actual Datasmith integration, so the EXE that's going to embed itself into our DCC programs, as well as enabling the Datasmith plugin inside of our project. Now, the Datasmith plugin has already been enabled for you for this class, but I'll still step through in case you need to know how that works. So the first thing that you need to do is download the appropriate exporter, the .exe file, and that's just as simple as searching for Unreal Engine Datasmith. It should take you to the web page, and from there, you can see all the different supported file formats and software that we can use. So simply download that EXE onto your development machine, install it, and you're good to go. Again, once you open up the actual asset or you authored that asset in that program, you should now have a new export preset file format, which is called Unreal Datasmith. We'll export out as a .U Datasmith. From that, it's a very simple exporter. In fact, it has very few options, which makes things easy for you. So all you need to do is select your hierarchy, select your assets, select file export, and export as your .U Datasmith. So the second thing that we need to have is our plugin set up inside of our project. So to do that, I'm actually gonna just go back to our project, go up to edit, plugins, and then from the plugins, all I'm gonna do is go up to my search bar and type in Datasmith. And you should get a number of different import kind of export settings. So with this, there's actually just a couple that we're concerned about as needing to be our baseline minimums. And that is going to be our Datasmith content as well as our Datasmith importer. Now you can see there are other file formats that are supported. So we could do our C4D for Cinema 4D, our CAD importer, our FBX importer, GLTF, ICF, and our Datasmith runtime. Now again, for this project, all we're concerned about is Datasmith importer as well as our Datasmith content. All right, so if you're doing this for your first project, you'll enable those and then you should get a little popup in the bottom right that says, the editor needs to be restarted. Go ahead and restart it, and then we should be back up and running. So the first indicator that you'll have that the plugin has been enabled is you should get a new bar, a new button on your toolbar called Datasmith. And if I highlight over that, you'll see that it says, import Unreal Datasmith file. Very important there. That's how you're going to actually import the assets into your project. All right, so let's go ahead and do that. So I'm gonna go ahead and click the import Unreal Datasmith file. And from here, I'm actually going to navigate to one of the folders that has the .u-datasmith asset. Now you may or may not have this included with your project. Not a big deal because again, we've already done this import process. However, I still want to show you how this works. All right, so I have exported the Audi A5 from Datasmith and you'll notice that I have this .u-datasmith file as well as a folder. All I need to be concerned about is this u-datasmith file. So I'll go ahead and click open. And you notice that it pops up a little dialogue saying, where do you want to save this? So I'm just gonna select my content. I'm just gonna create a new folder. I'm just gonna call this Datasmith. Click OK. And then I'll get the Datasmith pop-up window. Now again, this may change depending on your production workflow and what you need and what you've included in that Datasmith file. For the purposes of what we're working on today, if you recall, we downloaded our automotive materials from the marketplace. So we probably don't need to import our materials and textures, but we can still have it on, that's fine. We are not exporting any lights, cameras, or animations, so we can disable those. Now there are some settings here about your static mesh options, your minimum lightmap resolution and your maximum lightmap resolution. So I would go ahead and just leave this as default for now because we can always come back and change these later. So once we have this, again, we're gonna have geometry materials. I'm gonna click import. We'll let it run real quick and they'll actually see what it imports into our project. All right, and there we go. So you can see that it automatically opened up the folder where we imported our assets. So here's that Audi A5DS, which again was what we named our Datasmith file. I can double click this Datasmith scene, and if you notice, I have a lot of the same settings we just had with our import. And this is one of the very cool things about using this plugin, is that it's not a one-way street. And what I mean by that is even after you've imported your asset into your project, you can always go back and change your settings, which is great. Now we can see here with the Datasmith file, we exported 126 map elements. We also had 23 materials. So again, if we tried to import those all by hand, that would be a pain. Now just to kind of tease you a little bit about what you will be learning with Datasmith, one of the other big benefits to using Datasmith for your import is that it will also retain some of your pivot information. So if you're familiar at all with creating automotive assets, you'll know that pivot points don't always line up 100% perfectly. In fact, doors and hinges may not be exactly perpendicular to 90 degrees. And so Datasmith will also retain that information, which is great. All right, so let's take a look. So here's our vehicle, and you can see if we fly around. It doesn't look bad. Doesn't look great either, but we'll adjust that and change that here in just a minute. But you can see that it does have all of our components. So for example, I can go to my door. Now this pivot point is off. That's okay. That's how I set it up. But again, Datasmith will retain that information from your files when you import it. Let's go down to our content browser, and I'm gonna go ahead and just go into my materials, and you'll notice that I have very basic materials. Again, we can see that inside of our scene on the vehicle that's presently on screen, you can see that it does import those materials that were included from our DCC app. Now again, when this particular asset was authored, it used very basic placeholder materials. And that's very evident from the quality results. But again, not a problem. We're going to change that in just a minute. All right, so again, hopefully that kind of covers at least the two things. Again, we can have assets that we acquire from the marketplace. We can have assets we've used on other projects. And we can also have assets that we author that are very complex and for that we use Datasmith. And this will inject all the information and all the pieces that we need for our scene to begin setting it up. Again, don't worry about it. You don't have to import the Datasmith object. You don't have to download the automotive materials. They've already been included for you in this project. So let's go ahead and move on now to our next section, which we're gonna dive into a little bit about why spending the time and the effort to make high quality assets really makes a difference, especially visually and on your final product. So let's go ahead and do that.",
