  "text": " When it comes to modeling objects and optimizing them for real-time rendering, a good rule of thumb is to keep your triangle count in check to avoid superfluous geometry. Make sure that the topology is clean and try not to model small details that you can potentially simulate with proper texturing. Set yourself a budget for triangle count for each asset you need to build and work within those parameters. 3D programs often give you the tools to display those budgets in order to remain within them. This said, also keep in mind the fact that Unreal can display quite a large number of triangles if you need them, it just requires a bit of planning. The concept of LODs, or Level of Detail, is such that you can decimate the triangle count on a mesh if you're not standing close to it. Details cannot be perceived from a distance and the LOD system lets you automatically bring the triangle count down when you move away from an object in a level. You can create LODs directly in the engine or in your DCC app and carry them over through FBX. Create a new level, and a new folder in your Content Browser called LODs, and import the file named ForkliftPivotGood.fbx into it. Make sure you reset your FBX defaults before clicking the Import button. Six assets appear, including the one representing the Static Mesh. Typically, you can add LODs to any mesh asset by opening in the Static Mesh Editor. This can be done by double-clicking the thumbnail. Initially, a mesh would have a single LOD named LOD0. Here, you can choose to add any number of LODs manually, or elect to use a preset. For example, the Small Prop preset adds four LOD levels to the mesh. There are now four LOD levels in this menu that you can also switch between manually. LOD0 is the original, here showing the starting point of roughly 100,000 triangles for this model. You can see that as you switch from one LOD level to the next, the number of triangles and vertices are divided by a factor of 2 with each iteration. If you go close to the driver cage, you obviously can see the difference in quality between LOD0 and LOD3. Of course, although LOD3 looks bad up close, it is totally acceptable when the model is viewed from a distance. A better way of seeing this, or how the switch is happening, is to go back to LOD Auto, and then change the display to Level of Detail Coloration, Mesh LOD Coloration. As you move closer or further away from the object, the color code tells you when the switch from one LOD to the next is taking place. With every change, the mesh statistics also change, showing more or fewer triangles and vertices. The switch is in effect based on how big the object is displayed on screen, percentage-wise, and not the camera distance and world units. When you import an asset via FBX, you can certainly open the Static Mesh in the Editor and add LODs as shown. However, you can also skip this step by simply using the FBX Import dialog as a shortcut. Delete the assets from the Content Browser, and import the FBX file again to regain access to the FBX Import dialog. This time, expand the Advanced Mesh section and note that you have direct access to presets in the Static Mesh LOD group dropdown. This will do the same thing that you would usually do in the Static Mesh Editor, with the added benefit that it can be applied to multiple FBX files simultaneously. By checking the Static Mesh in the Editor, Note that it has indeed four LOD levels that were created at import time. Letting Unreal handle the generation of LODs is a good thing. Indeed, I would recommend this method as the LOD system in Unreal is very robust and does a very good job at decimating geometry and preserving texture UVs. However, should you prefer to do it differently, you can create custom LODs using your favorite DCC application. I will show you an example of this using 3ds Max, but keep in mind that different 3D programs sometimes have their unique tools and utilities. In 3ds Max, I have here the same forklift I had in Unreal a moment ago. However, you can see that I have set four LOD levels using the DCC's embedded functionality, in this case using 3ds Max's level of detail utility. This information is preserved and embedded in the FBX file at export time. When you import this file in Unreal Engine, and after resetting the Import Defaults, note the option to import Mesh LODs. Enable it and then import the file. Enable it and then import the file. The mesh viewed in the Static Mesh Editor indeed shows four LODs, but the decimation numbers differ slightly from the last model, as this one reads the information embedded in the FBX file. Both methods work well. Choose whichever you are more comfortable with. Save your project when done. Another method of keeping triangle count in check is Nanite. Nanite is newer technology when compared to LODs, and it decimates triangles on the fly rather than the abrupt switch you have with LODs. To experience it, load the map named Nanite. It shows a scene in an arid world, made of a collection of five different assets that you can see under FBX Nanite. As you hover over these assets, you'll see that they are reasonably heavy in tri-counts. In fact, if you were to type the console command stat rhi, you can see that UE5 is currently drawing an average of 6 million polygons for this scene. Let's enable Nanite on these assets. You can enable Nanite on geometry in various ways. One is to simply select the asset in the Content Browser and then enable Nanite with a right-click. You can also do so on multiple assets simultaneously. After a moment of calculation, the scene reappears, now showing an average triangle draw of just about 14,000. That's a significant drop from a few moments ago. You can visualize Nanite differently. First, disable stat rhi so that it's not in the way. Turn Nanite Visualization mode into Triangles. More clusters and then zoom in and out to see the effect of triangle decimation. Go back to Lit mode when done. When you import a model via FBX and you know this model is heavy in triangle count, you can of course add LODs to it at import time as you have learned earlier, but similarly, you can also enable Nanite at import time. Try that with the rocks FBX file, and make sure you enable Build Nanite in the FBX import dialog. These are the same rocks you already have in this level, but note that they have been imported with Nanite already active.",
