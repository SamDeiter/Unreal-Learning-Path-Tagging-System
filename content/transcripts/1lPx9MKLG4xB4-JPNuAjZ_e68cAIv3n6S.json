  "text": " We're going to start by talking about the importing and exporting pipeline. First, I'm going to show you this little image here from our documentation. The only important part for right now is this top section. These other keywords are going to be useful for you to look up in documentation for just knowing about our other animation assets. But up top, this is actually describing how we're going to import an asset from any given 3D modeling program through the FBX file format into Unreal. Unreal is going to understand things a little bit differently. It separates out every single aspect of our 3D animation, our model, our actual mesh, versus the skeleton itself. These things get separated. And Unreal is going to be able to use them in very modular and cool, genericized ways, which we'll see in our sub editors. Now, there's a couple of rules to building a skeleton. The first thing that you're going to have to see here in both of these images is that we have one root bone, which is the one at the center bottom of both of these. You can see it down here on the skeleton and then down here in the middle on the skeleton of the vehicle. Now, this actually is very important for our design when we go into blending our skeleton's bones using various methods from control rigs, IK solvers, or just our general animation blueprint blending methods. You're going to see that it uses this hierarchical understanding in order to actually blend and work with these hierarchies of skeletons. So keep in mind this hierarchy rule that everything has to be attached together and that it all has to go back to that base root bone. Any floating bones are going to give you additional skeletons in Unreal, and they're not going to give you exactly what you want. So if you have a floating bone for even some small assets that are floating around your body, you want to connect those back into some bone, even with just one additional helper bone that just exists to connect it back into the core of the skeleton. This leads us to talking about the Audi model we're going to be using as an example today. It is a full Audi skeleton that has the hierarchy built from the root. It follows a lot of good examples of how to use a skeleton and a mesh. You see that it is a simplified mesh. It is missing a lot of parts to it to keep it low poly, which is fine because Unreal understands skeletons and meshes as two separate things. So you can bring in a high quality, super high poly, nice mesh later, or even a series of static meshes from like a CAD file and stitch them onto where these bones are very easily in a blueprint. And that's just one example of how you can use your automotive files. We actually have several different pipelines for how you can create things that you're going to bring into Unreal. One thing to consider is a pre-made animation pipeline. This is the more traditional concept of you're going to make your full animation in Maya, Max, Blender, or whatever your DCC is. And you're going to build the entire thing out in that, bring the animation into Unreal, run it and render it inside of Unreal. Maybe you modify it inside of Unreal because you have our control rig backward solver as an option. The other option here is to do most of your work in editor with Unreal via control rig and by building everything in Sequencer. Once you've decided which pipeline you want to use and you feel like you have a comfortable understanding of the hierarchy you're going to build, you're ready to export from your DCC. When exporting animations to the FBX format for Unreal, you generally want to use the best practices guides of whatever software you're using. However, there are sometimes a couple of small caveats. For example, in Maya, by default, smooth mesh will be enabled. And you actually want to use smoothing groups instead. Unreal is going to understand those. Also, if you want to use anything with actual geometry cache for a baked animation, you want to use Alembic and not the baked animation option. We also want to make sure that the blend shapes checkbox is on so they will get attached to the skeletal mesh and Unreal will be able to work with them through that. 3ds Max's options are basically the same as Maya's. You only have the difference of blend spaces being called morph targets instead and it doesn't have Alembic built in by default like Maya does. Otherwise, it's all the same options. Blender, however, is going to be a little bit different. It has options for fixing its rotation. So you can give it the same rotational values as Unreal here, where when we import it, you can also fix it. If you couldn't do it in the exporter here, you can do it in the importer later. But here you can say, hey, we are doing x forward. We're doing z up just like Unreal says. We can also apply our smoothing, quote unquote smoothing, a little bit different than what we're doing here. Instead of smoothing groups, we're going to be applying modifiers and we're going to be using either our edge split or auto smooth options. If we use those, auto smooth is going to move the geometry as you see it in order to create smoothing surfaces. If you use edge split, it will create new geometry, additional geometry in order to create smoothing. So just know that those two are a little bit different. And then we just want to make sure that we don't leave the add leaf bones checked on and we want to make sure that we don't do any baked animations while we're doing this as well because we want to always maintain using a hierarchy of bones. But make sure you do double check on that add leaf bones checkbox because that will be on by default. Make sure it is not on. Otherwise, you'll get additional bones that you're not going to be working with. They can create problems if you want to make sure that they're not on. They can create problems if you weren't expecting them. So just uncheck that for our purposes. Also, you may have an option for export to Unreal depending on which DCC you're using. The export to Unreal option is really just where you pick what project you want to send it directly to. It cuts out a few of the steps by removing the exporting and importing process just a little. You have to set it up once and then that's it. Every time you choose export to Unreal, they'll send it to the same package until you reset it up for a different project you're working with. It can be useful, but also if you do want to switch back and forth between different things, you might not want to use it all the time. So it's up to you. And of course, we also have the inverse options. When we've created something new in Unreal or we've modified something we've brought into Unreal and we want to bring it back out and we want to bring it into something else to then further modify it or work with it, well, we have an export from Unreal option for FBXs. The way that this works is all that you have to do is find the asset you want to export, right click on it and choose asset actions, export. You'll then be asked where you want to put it and to name it, just hit save. And then it's going to ask you what things you want to export with it. If it was just a mesh, you can keep in things like the vertex color and LODs. You can also keep in any kind of collision data if it is a static mesh. In this case for a skeletal mesh, yes, we want to keep our export morph targets on that and also preview mesh. This might not be enabled by default if you're not using Unreal very frequently. Well, you definitely want to turn that one on. Otherwise, it's just going to export the pure animation and skeleton just via curves. You'll have no previewing mesh itself to go with it. So to include the actual mesh, the skin, check that on and then hit export. Now that we've covered exporting, let's talk about importing. When we bring skeletons, meshes and animations into Unreal, we want to make sure we get exactly what we want and nothing else. There's more than one way to import an asset into Unreal, but the easiest way might be to hit add import on the left here and then click on import to whatever the folder is you currently have open. Once you select that, you can just choose your asset and then hit open. Now we're going to open up this new menu for FBX import options. At this point, we have to decide what it is exactly we're bringing in. Since this is going to be a brand new FBX that's going to have a new skeleton, a new mesh and a new animation as our example, what we want to do is we want to check on skeletal mesh and import mesh. We also want to leave skeleton as none. We want to check on import animations to bring in animations. If we uncheck skeletal mesh, it'll bring in the mesh we have, but without the skeleton as a static mesh. So now we have a static mesh importer. We don't want to do that, so we're going to check that back on. If I uncheck the import mesh, we're going to bring in the skeleton as a static mesh. We're going to bring in just the animation because it just sees the skeleton and the curves that come with it. So we can just choose an already existing skeleton or start with just a skeleton and an animation with no visual mesh. Finally, we can also just bring this in without an animation, which is just going to bring it in as a skeleton with its mesh attached to it. If you're bringing in a skin and you want to swap out different skins onto a skeleton that already exists, all you have to do is change this from none to a skeleton that already happens to be inside of your assets. In this case, we might have this audio drivable skeleton. But I'm going to start this from scratch, so I want to leave that as none. You may also want to hit the Show Advanced dropdown. This is going to allow you to check on import morph targets, which is off by default. So if you do have blend shapes or morph targets, you're going to want to check that on. Also, where it says normal import method, if your skin for your mesh is inside out, you might want to change compute normals to import normals. It's not actually a very common issue, but it might happen. Create physics asset, you're going to want to leave that on. If you are going to use physics, you don't need it if you're not going to be using physics. Otherwise, I'm going to hide advanced because I am not going to change anything in this dropdown menu. Next up, we have animation options. So we have our import animations turned on, animation length is export time. And if I hit this little dropdown here, we'll also see animated time and set range. Animated time is going to refer to the actual frames in the animation we've exported. Exported time is going to give us extra dead frames if they do exist. Set range is going to allow us to cut up whatever animation we brought in. If it's very long and we only want a section of it, set range is going to allow us to do that. If I hit this little show advanced dropdown underneath animation, we'll see that if we have set range turned on, we'll get an option here for the import range, minimum and maximum. So we just put in what frames we want from that. I'm going to leave this one as exported time. And I'm just going to hit the dropdown menu's little hide advanced button again, so it goes back up. We're good to go on there. Now these transform changes are great if you do need to fix any rotational errors or if there's something offset a little bit. We also have under miscellaneous force front x-axis. So if you have something that's using negative y as its forward, so we can have it switch to x instead just by hitting this checkbox. So if you couldn't fix it in your DCC, you might be able to fix it here using either the transform changes or what changes happen here under miscellaneous. We also have any materials here if we need to bring any materials in, but mostly we're good at this point. I'm going to say, yeah, we're going to have materials come in. We're going to just keep the scene as normal. We're not going to make any force front x-axis changes, but this is going to be great for bringing in our first vehicle as long as we've already made everything to Unreal specifications. So at this point, whatever it is you're bringing in, you can just hit import. And I did a little skip ahead there, but it just loads for a second. And then you should get a series of assets in here. You should get your mesh asset, your animation asset, a physics asset, and a skeleton asset, as well as you may also receive material assets if those came in with what you have made. So we should have some stuff to work with now for the next section where we talk about the various sub-editors. So we're going to go ahead and do a little bit of a quick look at the materials that we're going to be using in the next section, where we talk about the various sub-editors.",
