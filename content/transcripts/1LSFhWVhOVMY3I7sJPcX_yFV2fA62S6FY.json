  "text": " When you start a new project in Unreal, you'll need to understand how it is structured. A project in Unreal is not made of a single file like most applications. It is made of a collection of files, folders, and subfolders. One of these folders is the Content folder and is represented in the Content Browser. This is where you will store all assets that you plan to use in the project you are working on. Based on the startup template you initially choose, you may have assets and folders already in place. You can of course add new folders and import custom data as you see fit, as you did a few moments ago. You can also add ready-made data effortlessly. For example, if you started your project without the Starter Content Pack option, you can add it at any time simply by going Add Import, Add Feature, and or Content Pack, and choose the Starter Content from the Content Pack tab. As you add that pack to the project, a new folder is created and additional assets are now at your fingertips. You can then easily drag them to add actors to your scene. Then you can transform the objects easily with using actions like Move, Rotate, and Scale. Which can be accessed in the Viewport menu or by using the Spacebar toggle. The Transform gizmo works very much like in any other 3D application. Snap modes are enabled by default and you can disable or enable them or adjust the snap increments in the Viewport menu. You can also duplicate any object by holding the Alt key whilst transforming it. A piece of rigid geometry in the Content Browser is referred to as a static mesh. It defines how that piece of geometry is shaped and built in terms of vertices and triangles. Once you drag and place it in the scene, it becomes an actor. An actor is any object you can place, select and manipulate in a scene. You can have any number of actors duplicated based on a single static mesh. In fact, it's one way to optimize real-time performance. It's also a quick way to update children actors if the original static mesh changes in its shape or form. An actor can be a piece of geometry but it can also be a light or a null object or a character and so on. Another method of ingesting ready-made data is to use Marketplace. Marketplace has a wealth of ready-made data that you can use to enrich your project. Some you pay for, some are free, such as the Scanned 3D People pack for example. Once you have downloaded a pack from the Marketplace, it is added to your vault in the game launcher. Depending on how it was packaged, you can add it to any project you have already saved to disk, or create a new project based on that pack. Either way, and much like with the Starter pack, a folder structure and associated assets get added to your project's content browser. This means that once you have access to all these various assets, you can place them in the scene with a simple click and drag. In this case, let's drag a couple of assets from the animation subfolder and place them on the main platform. You won't see the characters animate just yet. For that, you have to go into gameplay mode, which simulates the end results once you have compiled your project to a self-contained executable. Click the Play button on the main toolbar. This should automatically start and loop the animations. However, it will also move your character to inside the house. Press Escape to exit game mode. Go to the World Outliner and search for Player Start. Once you have found this actor, move it outside of the house and rotate it so that it is facing the animated characters. Now if you push the Play button, the game will start from this point, allowing you to see the animations. Now take a moment to hit the Save All button and save and update your project. Next, we will be creating an environment for your building. Click the Play button to start the game. Once you have completed the game, click the Save All button. Once you have completed the game, click the Save All button.",
