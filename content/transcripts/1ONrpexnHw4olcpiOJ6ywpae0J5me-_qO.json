  "text": " The next thing that I want to talk about in texture optimizations is the concept of mipmapping is understanding what mipmaps are and why they're needed is of vital importance because mipmaps can have a direct impact on how your project performs and understanding how you can manipulate mipmaps can allow you to perform some really amazing performance adjustments without having to sacrifice the quality of the final rendered pixels. Now mipmaps are automatically generated when you import any texture into Unreal Engine 5 guaranteed that that texture meets the power of two requirements in the X and the Y axis. When you import a texture behind the scenes, Unreal is going to generate what's known as a mipchain. Now a mipchain contains multiple levels of the same image with each level being half the resolution of the level before it. In the image on our screen in front of us, we can see a texture that is of a size of 4096 and then the next mip down would be 2048 and then 1024, 512, 256, 128 all the way down to 4x4. The reason this is done is so that when a texture is viewed very close to the camera we can view the highest resolution version of it and then as that camera and then as that texture gets further and further away from the camera we can utilize a lower and lower resolution version of it which helps us not only make that texture blend with the detail and the background better but also use less rendering performance. Now this is an example of mipmapping in action. On the left hand side we have a texture with mipmapping on and the right hand side same texture this time with mipmapping turned off and the main difference we can see here is that as this texture starts to go from the foreground to the midground to the background, notice that on the left hand side the texture seems to converge fairly nicely. We can kind of make out some of the detail as we would expect especially if we were looking at something in the real world. However on the right hand side as the texture starts to go off into the distance while things do converge there is a lot of noise in there and it makes it very hard to focus on anything and this is why mipmapping is so important. Not only does mipmapping help your textures especially textures in the distance look like they blend together it also makes things cheaper to render for those textures that are viewed in the distance. Now you might be thinking what do you mean by makes it cheaper to render? Well this is what I'm talking about. Here we have the ancient temple demo and we've taken that texture from our first slide and applied it to all of the static meshes in the world. As you can see the 4096 version of our mipmap or the highest resolution of that mipmap isn't actually utilized all the time. In fact we're more looking at 2048, 512, 128 and 256. This is really important to understand is oftentimes when you want to go utilize an 8k texture or even a 4k texture the only way to really see that full version mipmap is to view that texture very very close. Let's take a look at this inside of the editor in action. So here I have ruffle texture set up that's 1024 by 1024 and let's take a look at the texture in the background here as I start to get close to the one in the foreground. Notice that the cube is going to be changing as I get closer and closer to it we're going to 512, 1024 by 1024 but notice as soon as I start to back up just even a little bit we're going to start getting that 512 and then we're going to start getting the 256 and then the 128. So again mipmapping is responsible for what you're seeing or that transition between the various levels of that texture and if your texture meets the power of two requirements and the x and the y axis you'll have no problems actually using it because Unreal will do this for you all behind the scenes on import.",
