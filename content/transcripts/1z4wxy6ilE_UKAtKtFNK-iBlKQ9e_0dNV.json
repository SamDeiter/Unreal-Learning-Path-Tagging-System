  "text": " Welcome to another Epic Games Unreal Engine training course. Today we're going to be taking a look at an introduction to animation in Unreal Engine version 5.5. So we're going to aim to end with an understanding of the different types of animations that you have within the Engine. And we'll take a look at the animation editors and the different features that are available, depending on what type of animation you're working with, how you can import and export animations to and from the Engine. We'll also get an understanding of the differences between skeletons and skeletal meshes and cover a brief overview of the animation sub-editors. Then we'll go over how to create some new animation assets within the Engine. For that, we'll utilize sequencer and pre-existing animations. And we'll briefly cover how to attach an item to a character using a socket. So when we're talking about the different types of animation that you can have in Engine, what do we mean by this? So it's more understanding what you're going to use that animation for, which will sort of dictate how you should approach creating the animation and how you set the animation up in Engine. The first type of animation you could consider is what we might call input animation. So these animations are typically used for to play a character that you're controlling. And they're authored on the spot, so the character won't be moving through space when you export these animations. Now, the reason for that is that it's not the animations that dictate the character's movement, but something called the player porn. Now, the player porn is essentially a container of logic that takes the input information from your controller or your keyboard or your iPad or whatever it might be that you're using to control the character. And it dictates what the character should be doing when you press a certain button. So when I press W on my keyboard, the character's moving forwards. When I press S, it's moving backwards. And you can see this sort of container around our character here, something that's called the capsule. Now, this is just a visual representation of where this character's moving and how they're moving. So as I traverse around the space, you can see that that container is moving. And we've got animations playing within that container. Now, it's the animation blueprint itself that dictates what animation should be playing on the character. And it sort of gives that illusion of movement. So as this capsule is moving through the world, these animations are playing on the spot at a speed that matches the capsule's speed to give that illusion of movement. And this can be done with all sorts of different animation types. So if you're jumping, you're running or walking, you're flying or swimming, you know, whatever it is you want your character to do, you'd first set up the inputs from the controller to the player pawn, and then that information is fed through to the animation blueprint, which tells the character what animation to be playing and how it should look when it's moving in a specific way. And the other type of animation we would call linear animation. So this is more often used for cinematics or something that doesn't need to be controlled at runtime, essentially. And also, this means it doesn't need to be authored on the spot. So this is where our character or whatever it might be can be moving through space in the world and not worry about having to make adjustments at runtime. So this could come in the form of animations that you've created in external software, or you could actually create them directly in the engine using Control Rig inside Sequencer, or maybe you've got pre-recorded mocap or Alembic Caches that you could also set up inside Sequencer. But the key point is that they don't need to be controlled at runtime, and it's something that doesn't need to be authored on the spot the same way that an input animation needs to be. It's more like a one-shot or a cinematic that you would trigger once, and then you would just allow that to play out. Digging a little deeper into how animations are set up in Engine, we have something called Root Motion. Now, earlier I said that it's not the animation that drives the movement of the character, but it's actually the movement of the character that defines what animation should be being played. So whether that's walking or jumping or running, whatever it is. Now, Root Motion is a way of actually flipping that relationship. And as you can see here, it's a method to control the character's movement using the animation data on the skeleton's root bone. So looking at this GIF that's playing on the right-hand side, you can see that as the animation plays, the character's moving forward through space, and as they return to that idle pose, you can see that they blend back to the capsule because they're currently exiting the capsule with the animation. Now, when you enable a Root Motion inside the animation, you can see on the left-hand side here that that information on the root is being transferred to the capsule, and as they're blending back to idle, they're not snapping back because the capsule has now moved to where that root would have been. Now, an important thing to note here is that a skeleton needs a root bone for this to work. So if you're downloading animations or skeletons from somewhere online, like Mixamo, for example, you might find that they don't actually have a root bone, or they're using the hips or pelvis in place of it, and it's actually in the wrong place. So what you need is a unique bone that's at the top of the hierarchy, that is at world zero by default. A second thing to note is that Root Motion's not enabled by default. So this is something that you need to enable in the animation itself, and then something you need to set up in the animation blueprint to take the data from the skeleton's root bone and transfer that to the capsule so that you can get the data from the animation. To give an example of this, you can see that we've got a root bone at the top here, the top of all of our hierarchy, which is essentially your reference point for the entire skeletal structure. And so everything will be a child of this in one way or another. Now, in characters like bipeds or quadrupeds or anything that's living typically, the root goes to sort of a central branch in the skeleton, and then the other part of the skeleton goes to the capsule. The root goes to sort of a central branching point that is typically the pelvis or the hips, and then everything else branches off that in smaller branches, like your spine, your hands down to your fingers, or your thigh down to your feet. And what you'll find is with something like a car or something mechanical that's non-organic, you may actually have several of these branching points, depending on the requirement of the thing that you're animating or what the mesh needs to do. Now, organic characters often require things like twist joints as well. Now, these allow you to preserve the volume of like forearm, for example, as the wrist twists, and the recommended hierarchy for these are that they're best created as individual children of, for example, the elbow, rather than being in a direct chain from the elbow to the wrist. Now, this just gives you more control over the rotation without affecting the other joints in the chain. And overall, the key to the successful skeleton is just the hierarchy and considering how your character needs to deform and setting up the hierarchy and service of that. So we've looked quite a bit at gameplay animations and how you should set up your skeleton and the reasons why you might animate something on the spot or whatever. But now, if we compare sort of cinematic animation pipelines, sort of in-engine and out-of-engine, you'll find that a pre-made animation pipeline, you know, it's a fairly rigid workflow. It's been developed over many years by many different companies. You know, typically you'll create and you'll animate your characters in an external software like Maya or Blender, and then you'll bring those baked animations into the engine, where you would then, you know, set up the logic to utilize those animations. So typically in Sequencer, the cinematic tool in-engine, you'd take those baked animation assets and you could maybe stitch some animations back to back, blend them with one another, even apply some animations additively to get like some facial animation on there or some other additive animation on there. But any animation, any edit you need to make, really, you tend to come back into your external software, make that edit, export your animation, and then import it back into the engine. Now, you can modify the animation in Sequencer with the FK Control Rig that comes with it. So you could bake to the Control Rig and then make your edits and then bake that back down to an animation sequence. But typically what you would do is you would go back to your external software, make your edits and bring that back into the engine. And here's an example of, you know, that typical pipeline. It's quite like an assembly line, where one thing typically needs to be completed before the next thing can start. So kicking off with your story development, your storyboards, getting those iterated on and then going back and forth with editorial and as soon as they get signed off, that then allows you to start your modeling and your rigging and your scene setup. And as soon as that's all worked on and that's set up and that's been signed off, you can then start animating. So you can start blocking in your rough layout of your, you know, your character's animation, and then you'll keep iterating back and forth, back and forth, back and forth until that's signed off. And once it is, that's when the next team can kind of jump on it and start working on maybe its effects or crowds or moving on to lighting after that. But you'll see that typically one thing can't really start until the previous has been completed. And comparing that to the pipeline in engine, you have a lot of tools that will allow you to keep the rigging and the animation inside the engine without the need for re-exporting and then re-importing when you need to make some changes. So tools within the engine like Control Rig, I've got access to procedural rigging and modular rigging, and these allow you to create templates for different parts of the skeletons that work instantly across multiple characters in the project. So you could create and set up sort of FK and IK arms and legs that you can instantly just plug into different characters and that will just work straight away. You can then animate directly in the scene that you're rendering in with your Control Rig inside the sequencer. So this allows you to work with other teams in parallel as the scenes are being built and you're not having to wait for them to be finished before you can start animating. Some of the newer tools in Unreal Engine as well actually allow you to create skeletons and skin characters directly in the engine. This is available from version 5.3 and above, which means that your entire rigging and animation process can live inside the engine, working with the assets and the final scene that you're rendering out. A real-time pipeline has a few benefits over the offline pipeline or the pre-made pipeline. So all the pre-vis can be done directly within the engine, and then as you're working through each iteration, you update with the final assets as they're being created. You don't have to throw away any work, and everything that you're doing is building towards that final shot through each iteration. Now that allows teams to work more in parallel with one another rather than the sort of waterfall effect where you're waiting for one to finish before you can kick off. You can get your characters rigged and set up and animated in scenes that are being set up at the same time. And a huge advantage is being able to animate within the actual scene that you're rendering, and you can see all the real-time lighting, how that's affecting your character, all the effects that are in there, and anything that your character will be interacting with in the final shot, all happening in real-time. And all of that together gives you sort of a faster iteration time without having to jump between different softwares, importing and exporting. You're also not having to wait for renders to see how your shot looks, because it all runs in real-time, and gives you more sort of opportunities to experiment and more creative freedom to try things that would normally probably be too costly or time-consuming with that traditional linear pipeline.",
