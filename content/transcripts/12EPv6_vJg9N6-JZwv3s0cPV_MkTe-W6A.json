  "text": " Okay, so we're ready to get started with our introduction to Niagara. And first and foremost, I think it's important to just go ahead and answer what Niagara actually is. So Niagara is the tool that Unreal Engine 5 has to create visual effects inside of it. With Niagara, you can literally make anything between simple smoke, sprite-based smoke particle systems to full-on crowd simulations or fluid simulations. It really has a wide breadth of use cases in this case. And it's really built for anyone that needs VFX. So whether you're doing some work in architectural visualization, industrial design, TV or games, if you need VFX inside of your project, Niagara is the tool to do it. So you can see we have some examples here where the particles are actually reading from the skeletal mesh that they're being applied to, to fluid simulations with image descriptions. And also, in this case, we have a few bugs that are actually orienting themselves and walking along the surface of a mesh that they've been attached to. So really, really wide breadth of possibilities. And this is the kind of thing, well, this is the introduction to the system that allows you to do all these things. We're certainly not going to go into the depth of doing complex systems like this, but we're going to take a look at it from a very surface level and help you get started in Niagara. So before I do anything, I actually wanted to go and see if I could tackle a common question, which is if you already have a particle system or a VFX system that is made inside of Cascade, the old UE4 and UE3 system, to Niagara, the newest VFX tool. And we're going to go over, first look at the differences between Cascade and Niagara, and then convert in an actual particle system. So within Cascade, we have the Cascade system, and inside there we have the emitters and modules that drive the behavior of the particles. None of these are actually shareable outside of this particular Cascade system, and there's no way of creating templates or anything like that. So essentially, every time you set up to make a particle system or a VFX system, you have to start with an empty slate and get going from there. With Niagara, it's a much more open and tiered system. So the Niagara system will contain emitters, which can be their own asset type inside Unreal, which makes them really easy to share and lets you make templates that you can then modify depending on the Niagara system that they go in. Each one of those emitters also has modules that you can actually make scripts for. So if you wanted to change a particular behavioral module or make your own module, you could do that. And they're also easy to share between them because they can be applied to Niagara emitters and then inside of systems. And finally, the parameters that actually change the properties of the modules can be stored in a different asset as well, and they're really easy to modify. And you can also inside of Niagara itself, make your own custom user parameters that allow you to get a lot more variation that you ever could inside of Cascade. So it's a very, very versatile and open system. And we're going to go ahead now and take a look at how we go from a particle system that was already created in Cascade and bring it up to the modern Niagara system. As I mentioned earlier on, I've got the content examples project opened up. So you can get it from the samples tab, content examples. And you can see I've got this little level that opens up by default and I've dragged in a smoke particle system here. So if we take a look at what I've dragged in, it's this particle system here. You can find it by just going and searching smoke. And all I did is drag it in, like you see here. So this particle system was created with Cascade. If I double click, you'll be able to see it's a Cascade system. And we're going to convert it to Niagara. To do that, I actually need to restart the engine after enabling a plugin. So to do that, I'm going to go ahead and open up my plugins tab, search for Cascade and take this plugin on. It's going to give us a message here because it's in beta. So this is a tool that's actually still in development. And you'll see we're getting to get a few errors and little bits and bobs that we need to change. It's nothing too severe, but just understand that this is a tool that's still in beta and still needs a bit of work to be ready for shipping. But I'm going to go ahead and press yes, because I'm okay with that. And I'm going to restart my editor. And I'll come back once my, I'll save the level as well so that we don't have to redrag that particle system in. But I'm going to stop the video and wait till it loads up. So I'll see you in a second. Our plugin is now installed. And what we can do is we can now right click on our smoke particle and convert it to a Niagara system. So now that it's created an Niagara system for us, we're going to go ahead and open it up and take a look at it, see what it's actually doing. So I'm not going to get too bogged down actually looking at the UI or anything for this just yet because I just want to go ahead and kind of show you how to fix some of the issues that have been created by the tool. But you'll see that we have the three emitters and you'll see that we have some warnings here. So let's go ahead and take a look at how to fix them. So you can see it's done a fairly decent job overall. It's not exactly right. If I just bring this particle system here, you'll notice not exactly the same, but we're going to go ahead and fix those issues and get the same results. So the first thing you'll notice is that we have some warnings, like I said a second ago. So let's go ahead and take a look at how to clear those. So first of all, I'm going to untick the other two just so that we can work on this emitter on its own. And if I click on the properties section here where all these messages are appearing, you'll see that we have a bunch of messages that we need to acknowledge and clear essentially. And inside of the emitter system, you can actually see where there's an issue because it gives you these little dots and telling you that there might be an issue or not for you to check out. So in this case for the properties, it's just telling us that it's converted certain modules from Cascade modules to Niagara ones. So we're going to go ahead and acknowledge these issues. They're not a huge problem for us. So you can see particle module size multiply by life. They've all been converted to Niagara. So let's go ahead and clear those. So now that dot has gone away, there's no more errors there. So let's go ahead and check the spawn rate. And in spawn rate, you can see it skipped conversion of a particular bool. So once again, we can just acknowledge and clear it. Under initialize particle, we can find where the issue is and it's right here. And it's telling us that there's a warning here. It's saying conversions between positions and vectors is a potentially unsafe or at least lossy operation if working in large world coordinate space. Doesn't really have a huge issue for us. So let's go ahead and dismiss that since it's not a huge space that we're working in here. And then this WB animation, which is given us a warning here that this module has been soft deprecated, which means that it actually has been replaced with a new version but should still work. In our case, it does seem to be working fine. Yeah, actually. So it does seem to be working fine. So I'm going to go ahead and leave it. But in some cases, these nodes, if you get that error, the nodes actually don't work very well. So you might have to update things. Now you will see that it's not exactly the same. And the issue that we're having here is that the particles aren't being scaled in the correct way. So if I go to scale sprite size, one thing I need to know is that if I look at the cascade particle system, I can open it just to take a look at it. If I go here in the first smoke emitter and I go to size by life, it goes from 0.5 to 3. And in our case, the particle is going from 0 to 1. So we're going to have to fix that. So at 0, we're going to change that to 0.5. And at 1, we're going to change that to 3. So now this looks a lot more like the smoke that we have in the level. So now let's go ahead and take this distortion back on and clear the errors. So same thing, just going to have to acknowledge a few messages here. Let's go ahead and clear these. Fortunately, you have to kind of do it one by one. You can expand all to make it a little bit quicker. But then it might be worth collapsing all so that you don't have everything opened up. Next we have spawn rate, same issue as before. We can go ahead and clear that. And no more issues in this one. So the embers, last one. We'll clear the properties, property messages here. And almost done. Once again, our spawn rate, which we can acknowledge and clear. So we've cleared everything out. And now that particle system that was created in Cascade has been converted to a Niagara system and all the benefits that we get from there. And you can see if I just drag it here. Same result. So that's how you go from a particle system that was created in Cascade and bringing it and updating it to Niagara. In the next set of videos, we're going to actually create our own particle system from scratch. So stick around for that.",
