  "text": " In this video and the future videos that we'll be going through, we are going to be jumping into the engine. So to follow along, it will be good if you can open and create a Unreal project. For this workshop, I will be using the first person shooter template. So in order to do that, if you can open your Epic installer and go to the Unreal engine tab, select the library tab, and hopefully by this point you have an engine version installed. If not, just click on this plus button and install it. But I'm going to launch 5.31. It will take a minute to fire up. Once the engine has fired up, come and select the games tab, and under the games tab we will have the first person template. Now one more thing that I would like to do is if you could tick the button before starter content, what this is going to do is it's going to include some basic meshes and materials that we can use in the example we'll be making. Choose a project location and a project name and then just hit the create. Once the project is loaded up, you should see a screen which looks something like this. Now I'm going to do one extra thing here. I'm going to select the content drawer and I'm going to dock it into the layout. The reason being we're going to be working with assets in the content drawer quite a lot, so it'll be useful to have this visible at all times. Now we have the project started up. It'll be good for us to have a blueprint that we can play around with and explain. So to do that, I am going to right-hand click within the content directory and I'm going to get a menu of content that I can create. I'm going to select blueprint class. This will bring up a box which is going to show us all of the different parent classes which we could possibly create a child class of. Now to start with, you can see that we have the actor, horn and character classes. These are the three classes which we mentioned previously in the examples. The actor, the character being a child of the porn class and the porn class being a child of the actor class. We also have the player controller. This is not a child of the actor and cannot be seen within the world, but it can take control of a porn. And we have a few other classes of interest down here. Actor component being interesting because in the character component, the skeletal mesh and the movement are both actor components which are just attached to this class. If at any point you want to create a child which is not on this list, down below we have a drop-down box which will give us access to all of the different classes that are available to us. This can be augmented by either adding plugins or by creating and adding extra classes to the system. But what is useful as well is you can actually see the hierarchy here. So for example, you can see that we have under the object class, we have the actor class, the actor component, there are numerous other ones. If I was to do a drop-down of the actor class, you can see that there are a whole load of other actors that are objects that we can be dragged into. Now for this example, we are going to use a simple actor class. This is a common starting point for creating blueprints. In this, I'm going to rename this to be just example and then I'm going to double click on it to open it up. And with that, we should be ready to start doing some coding.",
