  "text": " So talking, that's kind of the high level abstract stuff, but now we're going to apply some of this more specific to the gameplay, and also we're going to get probably more specifically into these really maybe more unique concepts to Unreal. So as we said, we've got this server client setup. We've talked about this a little bit. We've got some overlap, no pun intended, with the Venn diagram in front of us, some overlap with I think our second session where we talked about this again a little bit. But it's worth highlighting again what of the typical gameplay framework elements exist on the server, which exist on clients, and which exist on all of them. So first off, kind of the first thing to mention is that our game mode exists only on our server. If we are in a server client situation, so a dedicated server with clients, if the clients try to access their game mode, that would not be available to them. It would literally, if you tried to get your game mode, it would just return none, because it literally doesn't exist. So there is a little bit of confusion on that. I think if you look up various things online, some people say that maybe the game mode does exist on the clients, but it's not replicated, that's not true. The game mode is purely just not available. Then we have the game state. So the game state is essentially, again we talked about this in our second session, but the game state, whereas the game mode is kind of the slightly more static version of the data, again it's only available to the server, so it's kind of not there to query live runtime things that are going to change, that other clients need to know about. The game state is there for that data. So the game state is there to represent information about the game, the current level session, that every player may need to know about, and that is because the game state exists on both the server and on clients. So all of the game state can have its data replicated. It's kind of expected that if you're putting data into the game state, it's probably intended to be replicated, and that therefore every client will be able to read that data and expect that it's going to represent a relatively up-to-date representation of what is true on the server. Then we have the gamestance. The gamestance exists both on the server and on clients, and it's worth mentioning that this is not replicated, this is just a class that exists. Again, we talked about the relationship of the gamestance in our second session, but each connection, both each client and the server, will have their own version of the gamestance. That's just a relatively fundamental game class that's kind of just worth highlighting about, and it's that the gamestance is going to have that lifetime that persists between sessions. So that's for kind of persistent data that will preserve between different levels. That's what your gamestance is for. The player controller exists on both the server and the owning client. So for client one, the server will have the player one controller, and player one, client one, will have player one's player controller. The server will have a player controller for every connected client, and then each client will only see one player controller, and that is basically their player controller. That is the kind of key element that acts as the central point of communication between that player and the server. We'll come back to that a little bit later, but it's just kind of worth noting that relationship. Then we've got the kind of pawn or character, and the expectation is that that is going to exist on the server and on every client. Obviously, for the other players, you need to be able to see them, so their representation should be replicated to your client. So as player one, I should have some kind of representation of player two. Obviously, depending on your game, that pawn may be abstract if you're doing some kind of setup where you can't collide with each other and you can't see each other, but still the standard expectation is that that pawn would at least be replicated to each client, regardless of how it's represented. Then we have the player state. So where as player controller, there's this kind of one-to-one relationship where the server will have every player controller, but then each player will only have their own controller, and there's that connection, their unique connection between themselves and the server. The player state is there to represent the kind of global data about that player. So every player sees the player state of every other player. And again, similar to the way game state's relationship is to game mode, where it's kind of there to represent the global replicated data about the game, that same relationship exists kind of between player state and player controller. Player controller is not intended to be replicated to every client. Player state is. Player state is the global data that is replicated, that is on the server, is replicated to every client, including the player who the state is really describing. And it is there to represent the kind of globally accessible data about that player. And then last of all, we have things like HUD. This is the kind of typical example from the gameplay framework. So HUD is something that you would, you know, is actually one of the classes on the game mode that you can kind of choose to spawn in. There are plenty of other things, but basically this is going to be things that only the client would need to care about that typically wouldn't affect gameplay in any meaningful way. Your HUD is not going to or shouldn't go changing your players health or anything like that. They are kind of just there to reflect game state. So your HUD is obviously just going to reflect whatever your health currently is, whatever your ammo currently is, if it's a game that has ammo and, you know, various things. The game is changing and the HUD is really just there to give you a representation of that data. There are other examples of things that would only exist on the local clients. This might be like visual effects. This can even be particular actors. If you have an actor that is kind of like, say you had some kind of, for anyone who has maybe a game that has some kind of companion NPC that will come in and talk to you occasionally, maybe that's something that really the server doesn't care about, really other players don't care about. There might be examples of actual actors that would get spawned in that, you know, only the player, the local player would care about.",
