  "text": " Now that we've had a look at some of the light types and some of the basic properties of lights, let's go ahead and take a look at one of the lighting systems on Unreal Engine 5, which is going to be Lumen. The topics that we're going to cover in this video are what is Lumen, how we set it up, some quality control to make sure we get the best out of Lumen, some tips and tricks, as well as some visualizers that we can take a look at to troubleshoot some of the issues that we might have with Lumen. So when it comes to what Lumen is, it's Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system, which is designed for the next-gen consoles as well as high-end PCs. Now, what's really cool about Lumen is that you're not dependent on a high-end ray tracing GPU to get ray tracing essentially. And another thing that's really cool about Lumen is that it renders the fusing to reflection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections in large detail environments that scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. Now, the thing and the important thing about that is it provides infinite diffuse bounces, which means when it comes to light bleed in between or the color bleed in between surfaces in Unreal, we aren't limited to a particular number of bounces. We have infinite bounces for that, which is really cool. Now, another thing that's great about it is that when used in combination with non-eye spiritualized geometry, it allows us to have very, very, very detailed geometry and also achieve full resolution fading while computing that indirect lighting cheaper than ever before. Skylighting is also solved as part of Lumen's final gather process, and that includes sky shadowing, which allows for indoor spaces to be much darker than outdoor lighting and you get much more natural feeling effects. And another thing to keep in mind is that it also provides slightly lower quality global illumination for lit translucency volumetric fog, although that's improving as we speak and we hope that future releases actually make this really, really cool. Another cool feature about Unreal is that it supports emissive materials at no additional performance cost. There is a limit to how small and bright your objects can be that emit light, so it's actually always a little bit better to use actual lights in this case. And another thing to keep in mind is that it's troubleshooting these things that can be harder to solve than manually placed lights, but it is still a really cool feature to have, especially for like larger meshes. When it comes to reflections, it solves indirect specular or reflections for the full range of the material's roughness value. And another great thing is that diffuse global illumination and shadow skylight can be seen in reflections as well as being supported in clear coat materials, which is really, really cool. What does it replace then? So it replaces the skylight with ambient occlusion or shadow skylights. It replaces any form of screen space global illumination system that we might have had. It replaces full-on hardware ray tracing global illumination as well as any third-party global illumination solutions. Now, how do we set this up? To set Lumen up, you just need to make a few changes on the project settings. So under project settings, you want to go to the rendering tab and make sure that the dynamic global illumination system is set to Lumen, that the reflections and their method is set to Lumen as well. And this should happen automatically, but it doesn't. Just make sure you double check that generate mesh distance fields is on. And another thing that you might need to do is change your default RHI to DirectX 12 so that you can have shader model 6 enabled, which is required for some of the visualizers. From here on, any other changes that we want to do down the line for changing quality and things like that will be done via the post-process volume. Now, if we take a look at some of the things that we can do to get slightly better reflections, if you have a good enough card, is one cool thing about Lumen is that it can form a little bit of a hybrid system with actual ray tracing. So you can set up your reflections to be ray traced. So to get better reflections, and if your card can handle it, as I say, you can change these settings to change the ray lighting mode to hit lighting for reflections and the software ray tracing mode to detail tracing. Now, when it comes to quality control and how we can change the quality for performance for performance in terms of Lumen's scene quality settings, we can go to the post-process volume and change the following things. So if we change the Lumen scene lighting quality, it scales the actual quality of Lumen. So larger scales on this will mean that the Lumen scene is calculated with higher fidelity, which will be visible in reflections, for example, but the larger the value, the higher the GPU cost. And you'll hear me say this a lot, especially when we start tweaking values to get better detail. The Lumen scene detail controls the size of instances that can be calculated in the scene. So the larger the value, the smaller the objects that can be calculated, but again, at the cost of GPU. The Lumen scene view distance. So if you set the maximum view distance, so that the scene maintains, sorry, the sets the maximum view distance of the scene that Lumen maintains for ray tracing against, the large values will help with sky shadowing and global illumination, but again, at the cost of GPU. And then we have the Lumen final gather quality which scales Lumen's final gather quality. And again, the larger the values, the less noise, but the higher the GPU cost. Now some more advanced settings here, the lighting update quality settings. So if you change the Lumen quality update speed, it will control how much Lumen scene is allowed to cache the lighting results that help with performance. So the larger the value, the faster those changes are going to propagate, but the higher the GPU cost. And when it comes to the final gather lighting update speed, it controls how much Lumen final gather is allowed to cache those lighting results, just like before. And again, the larger the values, the faster those changes are going to propagate, but again, at the cost of your GPU. When it comes to reflections, to get higher quality reflections, you want to change under the Lumen reflection sections. If you change the values of the quality here, it will reduce the noise and the reflections, however, higher GPU cost. And then one tip is to change the ray lighting mode to hit lighting for reflections. And that will be the highest quality, but again, increased GPU cost. Now some visualizers that you might be that you might find handy to troubleshoot some of the issues that you might be having can be found. So under the show tab, you've got under the Lumen section here, a lot of information that you can take to actually see and visualize any of these changes. And then if you go under the lit, or the view mode here, if you go to Lumen, you can also see the overall Lumen scene, how the reflections are doing and what the surface cache is doing. Now to get into some tips and tricks that you might find handy when it comes to using Lumen. So Lumen does not currently support fully mirrored reflections. It's on the roadmap, but currently it's limited. It does not support any static lights, which I think would make sense considering that we are using a fully dynamic global illumination system. Now, however, one cool thing is that if you do disable allow static lighting, it can help with some of the overhead and it makes sure your Lumen process is working with no hindrances. Now, another cool thing is that Lumen does support material and inclusion, which is really good for characters. It does not currently support world position offset. So if you have it active in a project, any of those materials that it offset inverts through the material will become a little bit blurry in the movement. It does support all physical lights, but as long as the mobility of those lights is set to movable. And a couple of cool little tricks, especially if you're trying to soften your shadows, is the source angle on the main directional light that will change and soften your shadows for that dominant directional light. And if you change the source radius, the larger the source radius, the softer your shadows are going to be. So those are some tips and tricks that you can find handy when working with Lumen. Okay, so here's some additional resources if you need them. After this, we'll be taking a look at Nanite and its virtual shadow map.",
