  "text": " Okay. So we're going to take a look at some new tools to get started. But like I said earlier, we are literally picking up where we left off in the Intro to Control Rig course. So if we just open up our Control Rig here, you can see it's exactly the same as what we had set up, right? We're just going to be taking a look at how we can essentially make this a little bit nicer and modernize it a little bit. So you'll see we've got two bones here, or sorry, two nodes. Sorry that we've got already set up. I'm actually going to delete these. You have them here if you want to take a look at them, but I'm going to delete these so that we can take a look at them individually. And yeah, essentially, the first thing we're going to take a look at, if we go back to our slides, is what the two nodes actually are. So the two nodes that we're going to look at are ProjectorNewParent and IK2Bone. So we're actually going to do it in reverse order to what's here. So first we'll look at the IK2Bone. And really, this is just a function that collects everything that we've done and a little bit more in the previous course into one nice tidy little function that you can replicate along and that you don't have to constantly rebuild the thing that you've built throughout other rigs and things like that. So that's really just a vision way of setting up our IK setup. And then the ProjectorNewParent, which works like Constraint, in which it kind of sets, like it tells the control to go to where the bonus is, but it also allows us to apply an offset to that parent. So essentially, we're going to take a look at this to kind of fix the issue that we had to manually fix by rotating the control and we mirrored the hand control over. So this node essentially will fix that for us and we're just going to take a look at how we're going to set it up. But for now, let's go ahead and take a look at the IK2Bone function. It's really easy to bring up. It's just a function. Like I say, it just collects a bunch of the stuff that we have already done inside of the control rig or the course that we did last time. So let's take a look at it really quickly. So essentially, we're looking to replace this whole section here, right? And we're going to do it with the left arm first, but we'll do it for both. So to find the IK2Bone, you just IK2Bone. That's all you need to search. And you can see we've got our IK2Bone here. And you'll see it's asking for a few inputs. And the inputs are the kind of things that we were inputting already in our basic IK stuff. So what's the item ABC? So like what the bone setups are and then what the pole vector is and things like that, right? So in our case, we're just going to fill it in the way we would expect. So the pole vector node is going to be our pole vector L. We've already made these. So you can just go ahead. Bone A, B and C are going to go down the IK chain. So bone A is going to be the upper arm. B is going to be the middle joint, which is going to be our lower arm. And then C is going to be our hand. So bone A is going to be upper arm L. Bone B is going to be lower arm L. And bone C is going to be the hand L. Now the end control is what control is going to control this IK system. So in this case, it's going to be our hand underscore L control. So now if I just skip that node entirely and I compile, you'll see, by the way, as you're doing this, you might find that your body breaks completely. This is normal until you compile, right? So once we compile, you can see it's all good. So you can see now we've got our IK setup with a little bit of extra functionality actually. And you can see it works perfectly fine. So let's compile that. So let's take a look at what this actual function is doing. If we double click it, it'll open up the function for us. And you can see it's just an input node or an entry node in this case with a bunch of input variables or input connections that you can do. And it's just doing all the math and things that we did before, like, for example, compute the IK with the basic IK node. You can see that's what we're using outside. It's basically replacing all this. And it's using the basic IK node. It's finding the transform for the control of the pole vector. And that's once again, just an input node, which is the pole vector. And we fill that input node by just assigning an input value right there, right? As long as we fill that in, it knows what to drive that value with and sets up our IK for us. And you can also see it's actually setting up the vector for this already taken into account the projector new parent node that we're going to take a look at later. So we're going to take a look at how we actually figure that out. But then again, it has some extra functionality. So it draws a line between the pole vector and the middle joint of the IK and some stretch calculations, which is kind of handy. Okay. So with that, you can see we've got everything set up. And now the next thing I want to do is actually set up the right side. And I'm going to show you a quick way of doing this. If I right click on this node, I can search and replace mirror. I'm just going to create a duplicate of this, but I can search for L on the score L and replace with underscore R. My apologies, because you need to duplicate this first. So I'm going to copy and paste the setup and search and replace mirror. And that's going to be on the score L to underscore R. And you'll see all the controls in here. And now set up correctly. Now the only thing that we still need to fix is that now we are primary and secondary axes are going to be wrong. So I always just plug this in, just like I did with the other IK two bone. You'll see I get some pretty funky results, right? So you just need to make sure we've already got this figured out, right? But you just need to make sure that you flip the primary and secondary axes to make sure that it works for the right side. And once you do that, you can see, I'll compile this just to make sure, but you can see this now works perfectly fine. And we've got that line being drawn, I say, between the middle joint and the IK control. So that's how you would set up all of this in just a couple of nodes without having to think about it too much. As long as you've got the controls created, like we have already, right? We won't have any issues. So let's take a look at the next control or sorry, node, which is going to be the project a new parent, right? So to bring the project a new parent, you just need to search project a new parent. And there we have the node. Now, we're going to look at this or how this works within the context of an issue that we were having in the previous course, which was when we mirrored the right control over to the left side, we were seeing the hand flipping. And the reason for this essentially, that the there's a mismatch between the orientation of the control and the orientation of the joint. So we end up with the hand flip. And we're going to take a look how we fix that. So for now, I'm just going to plug these original IKs back in so that we can see the issue because if not, the IK 2 bundle will fix those automatically for us. But I think it's important to actually learn about this node because it will be handy for other setups in the future. So we're back to what we had originally. And let's go ahead and cause the issue. So I'm going to delete this control, the left side. I'm just going to create a new one by just selecting that right control. I'm going to mirror. I'm going to go replace underscore R with underscore L. And you can see now we have a control here, but with the hand flip, which is the issue that we were seeing the last time. I'm going to make this blue. It's a little bit more easy to understand what's going on. And if I compile once again, like this isn't fixed, that you can see there's a flip here. So how do we fix this? So we're going to project a new parent. And the way this works is essentially it gets the offset between the child and the old parent and applies that offset as a new parent to the new parent. Right. So how would this work? So we need to get the offset between the original hand bone to the control itself, because we know that there's a mismatch, right? We've mirrored it. So there's a mismatch between the orientation of this and this. And then we want to apply that offset to the control itself again. So, uh, hand L control. So we're getting the initial transform of the bone, the initial transform of the old parent. In this case, it's the control. So we see the difference between the two and then we apply it as an offset with the new, with the new parenting system to the control itself. So if I compile this, you can see we still have the issue. As soon as I update this effector and compile, you can see it's fixed and everything works. Right. So that's really, uh, what the project and new parent is doing. It's a little bit hard to get your head around at first, but this will be really handy for you if you ever do anything like reverse foot setups or any situation in which you want to reparent something, but include an offset, um, within that. And, uh, you can't just plug in a manual offset. You have to just essentially choose the two things with that have an offset between them and apply it to the new parent. Okay. So that's how it works. And really that's our entire setup. Now you'll notice that this project to new parent node is already handled inside of the IK2 bone, right? We just looked at it before, but you can see they're doing exactly the same thing. So if I hold this over, we've got bone C, which in our case is going to be the hand. That's the child. The old parent is going to be the end control and the new parent is the end control. Again, once again, we're checking the offset between these two and applying it to that new parent. So, um, that's project to new parents. So in our case, now that we're happy and we understand both nodes, we can actually just bypass all of the work that we did here because it's already done for us. And replace all of the IKs that were just two nodes, which makes everything nice and clean and just quickly check that everything is working. All good. Okay. So that concludes this part. But for me, what's important is that you should now have a working rig, but it's using like newer tools and newer function and things like that. We've not covered it before. But we're going to build actually our own functions to do other, handle other things later down the line. But for me, what's important is that now you have a nice rig setup that's simplified and it's using a function. And we understand how to use a couple of new tools now from the control rig tool library. So we'll see you in the next section.",
