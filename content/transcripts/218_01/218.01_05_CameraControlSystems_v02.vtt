00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
Now in this section, we're going to talk about camera control systems and then create a virtual

2
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.620
live link subject so that we can do it ourselves if you don't have one of these camera control

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.600
systems. Camera control systems can stream lens data directly into Unreal Engine using any one

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.879
of the optional peripheral devices that you can pick up from vendors such as Preston's hand

5
00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:26.600
view it. Now to calculate lens distortion, the lens file asset needs to know both the focal length

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.079
and focus distance of the lens that's being used. There are several available hardware options

7
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.400
that are capable of streaming Fizz data from production cameras to Unreal Engine through a

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.439
live link plugin. The Master Lock It, Preston MDR and the DCS plugin are all viable options,

9
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.400
but most vendors should have an optional plugin that you can download from their website and

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.439
use in conjunction with Unreal Engine. Now some hardware connects to smart lenses made by Zeiss

11
00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:58.839
and Cook. Other devices connect directly to focus systems such as the Preston and these are

12
00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.200
commonly used by first ASCs for adjusting or pulling focus and controlling the aperture or

13
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.519
iris of the camera. Now the DCS lens data translator can convert smart lens data in

14
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:17.079
addition to streaming lens data from different focus systems. Additionally, RE also has a

15
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.799
hand focus system and the RE-CAM metadata plugin for streaming that Fizz data. Note this is

16
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.519
required using the pre-built 5.0 plugin and it is up to RE to determine when this plugin will be

17
00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:36.120
updated for 5.1. Additional notes here that you want to be aware of is that distortion of a real

18
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.560
lens needs to be emulated by the CG lens to have the same distortion characteristics when adding

19
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.599
AR or CG extensions that are not seen in camera view, but are added as a composite layer. These

20
00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.719
distortion parameters will change as the focus is changed during a tape and by streaming the Fizz

21
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.719
data, the camera in the Unreal Engine can be updated in real time by the lens file and apply

22
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.640
these values to the CG composite elements. If you don't have this, your post team is likely to throw

23
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.039
away everything that you've shot and redo this in post. So if we want to pull our camera control

24
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.759
systems for calibration and we want to do this on our own, we're going to need a live link virtual

25
00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:22.039
subject. So let's jump over to the Unreal Engine. Now if you don't have access to per-refrials for

26
00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:27.400
streaming, a virtual live link subject blueprint can be used to manually input focus, aperture,

27
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.919
and focal length values with the following steps. To begin, we're going to move over to our calibration

28
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:39.639
folder and we are going to create a folder for lens files. Let's go new folder, lens files,

29
00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:47.639
and inside that folder, we are going to create a new blueprint. So let's go ahead and right click

30
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.039
here and go to live link because we need a virtual subject. So we're going to create a blueprint

31
00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:58.359
virtual subject. So again, right click, move up to our live link and go to blueprint virtual subject.

32
00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:04.759
Now the role that we're going to choose for this is going to be our live link camera role. So we're

33
00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:10.039
going to choose this from our drop-down menu and go ahead and click OK. Now this is going to give us

34
00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:17.319
our blueprint, which we are going to rename BP for blueprint, live link virtual subject or LLVS

35
00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.519
and we're going to give this the black magic Zeiss underscore 25 for our lens name. We want to do

36
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.719
that so that we know what subject this is actually controlling with our lens camera combination.

37
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.159
Once that's done, we can go ahead and double click on this to open it up so that we can start building

38
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.759
our blueprint. Now as we get started in here, you are going to want to create a few variables.

39
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.919
So we're going to move up to the upper left hand corner here and you're going to see this option

40
00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.559
called variables and I'm going to start with hitting this plus button. My first variable,

41
00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:55.719
I'm going to change this type from Boolean to float and I'm going to rename this variable

42
00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:01.879
the focus. So this is the F in our fizz for focus. Now I want to make sure that this is

43
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.519
instance editable. So I'm just going to go ahead and click on this little eyeball and that makes

44
00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.199
it instance editable. Now I'm going to need a few more versions of this. So let's go ahead and

45
00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:18.519
duplicate this by hitting control D and let's rename this one to iris and do control D one more

46
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.199
time and let's call this one zoom. So now we have focus iris and zoom or as we like to call them for

47
00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:31.319
short fizz. Now we need to go into our event graph and from here we need to create some event

48
00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:37.159
options. So we're going to start out here with our event on initialize. Let's move this up to the

49
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.560
corner so we can kind of focus on it. I'm going to drag out from my executable and I'm going to

50
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.319
create a new node and this one I'm going to type in update virtual subject and I want to select

51
00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.600
the subject from my static data. So I'm going to choose update virtual subject static data.

52
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.480
Now with my static data I do want to hover over my static data pin and I want to right click on this

53
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.959
and split my structure pin. Splitting my structure pin is going to give me a number of options to

54
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:09.560
work with and I want to make sure that these options that I want to work with are enabled.

55
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.360
So the first one I want to enable here is the static data is focal length supported. Next I want

56
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.800
to make sure that my static data is aperture supported and finally let's make sure that my

57
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.000
static data is focus distance supported. Now I have my virtual subject ready to go and I need to

58
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.759
create a few more options here. So I'm going to do the same thing over on my event on update

59
00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.319
and in my event on update I'm going to drag this out and I'm going to go ahead and search again

60
00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:46.040
for update virtual subject but I'm going to look this time for my frame data. So in this version

61
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.279
I'm going to on my update choose my frame data. Now just like before I'm going to move this over

62
00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.519
and I'm going to hover over my frame data and I'm going to right click on this I'm going to split

63
00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:02.759
this structure pin. Now I've split my structure pin and I can see that I've got a couple options

64
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.039
here frame data focal length frame data aperture and frame data focus distance. Now I'm going to

65
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.879
start with my focus distance and what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to drag for my focus

66
00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.400
distance and I'm going to look for a variable and that variable is going to end up being my focus.

67
00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.560
So I'm going to get my focus my focus is the variable that I created so let's go ahead and

68
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.879
grab that. Now I can also drag one of these in so let's drag in my iris and let's get my iris

69
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
and you can see it's the same kind of node I'm going to connect that to my data aperture.

70
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.600
Now again I can always drag this off and I can always search so I'm looking for my zoom and I

71
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.960
can just get my zoom and now I have my variables controlling my focal length. So each of these

72
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.520
variables actually grab all of my focus distance my aperture and my focal length. Once this is done

73
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.800
and assembled all I really need to do right now is go ahead and hit compile and then save and that's

74
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.560
pretty much it for our virtual live link subject creation. Now we need to make sure that this

75
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.439
subject is accessible so I'm going to go ahead and close my blueprint and you can see I've got my

76
00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.399
virtual subject in here and I'm going to move over to the right side of my screen to my live link

77
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.639
section. If you don't have your live link tab you just go under window you can move on down to

78
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:23.319
virtual production and open up this live link tab that'll give you this option in here and now I

79
00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:29.079
need to create and add a virtual subject to my source. So inside my live link tab I'm going to go

80
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:33.000
ahead and hit this source button and I'm going to go add virtual subject. I'm going to go ahead and

81
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.120
click that button. Now I'm going to give myself a virtual subject name and so I want to make sure

82
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.639
that I rename this subject so I'm going to call this live link virtual subject black magic Zeiss

83
00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:49.399
25 and that's going to give me my live link virtual subject and then I'm going to choose the

84
00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.159
virtual subject that we just created so I'm going to choose the blueprint that we created here.

85
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.199
That's going to allow me to add the subject name telling me what this is that I'm using

86
00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.319
and add that to my source here. Now you can see I've got my black magic subject name in here

87
00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:09.159
and that's going to give me the option to control my focus iris and zoom in my live link virtual

88
00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:15.319
camera. Now in order to make this work you'll see over here I've got my NBC camera. I'm going to move

89
00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:22.279
up to my outliner and select my camera. With my camera selected I need to add in a new option so

90
00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:27.719
let's look at our details panel. Now in my details panel I should have a tracked object in here and

91
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720
I don't have my tracking setup just yet but we're going to need that in order to track our camera

92
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.759
for our option. What I'm going to do is I'm going to need to first create my live link fizz data in

93
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:41.960
order to control that so hit this add button and in my add button I'm going to type in live link

94
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.639
and you can see I've got two options live link skeletal animation and live link controller so

95
00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:50.519
I'm going to use controller and this is a live link component controller so I'm going to call this

96
00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:57.319
ll underscore cc for live link component controller black magic underscore zice and this is my fizz

97
00:08:57.319 --> 00:09:01.240
data so I'm just going to type fizz on the end of this. I'm going to hit enter and I'm going to choose

98
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.840
my subject representation. For this you can see I've got my black magic zice 25 I'm going to choose

99
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.039
my camera roll and this is actually going to control my camera roll so now my fizz data is

100
00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:16.199
going to be controlled from my camera and that's going to actually control and allow me to make

101
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.600
those changes so that any of my focus iris and zoom are going to be set in here. Now if you have

102
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.160
forgotten how to do a tracked object in here you just want to make sure that your source is active

103
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.920
and you want to load in a source for your opti track and then connect that source and make sure

104
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.040
that's set for your preset. That's it for creating your virtual live link subject. Next we're going

105
00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:45.879
to talk about one more little tool before we do our lens calibration.
