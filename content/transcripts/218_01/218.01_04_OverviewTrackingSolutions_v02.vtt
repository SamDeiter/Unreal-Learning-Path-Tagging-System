00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
In this next section, we want to do a quick overview of our tracking solution, plugins,

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.000
and system operations as we prepare for our Lens file calibration.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.480
You'll see here in virtual production in ICDFX a list of our plugins.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
The plugins that you have here in blue, the Aja Media Player, Blackmagic Media Player,

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.879
Camera Calibration, LED Wall Calibration, Live Link Camera, Live Link Lens, and Open

6
00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:30.480
CV Lens Distortion are all the plugins that we need active for our calibration.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.519
As I mentioned before, the Latte stage uses the OptiTrack system with Motive, and we

8
00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.399
need to have those OptiTrack Live Link and Streaming Client plugins made available for

9
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.759
our Unreal Engine plugin.

10
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:48.519
Anything that you see here in orange, those are our virtual production-related plugins,

11
00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.039
and those can be implemented as well.

12
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.719
Now, our options for our tracking system.

13
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.240
The Latte stage, as I've mentioned, uses the OptiTrack Motive system for performance

14
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.320
capture and for our camera and object tracking.

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.039
We also use this for nodal point calibration and lens distortion mapping, but there are

16
00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.319
other options that are available to you, Vicon Showgun, the Vive Tracker, as well as the

17
00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.640
Vive Mars system.

18
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.420
Note, you want to make sure that when doing camera tracking, it should be active as part

19
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.960
of your stage setup.

20
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:24.879
Your tracking setup, including setting the origin point, or the 000 of your tracking

21
00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:29.719
volume for camera calibration and lens distortion mapping, are also covered in some of this

22
00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:30.719
course.

23
00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.639
However, there is plenty of documentation on the various vendors' tracking solution

24
00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:40.879
websites, and there's a lot of video documentation that you can follow to go through these steps

25
00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.879
on your own.

26
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.039
Now, in our next section, we're going to take a look at some of our camera control systems

27
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.959
before we build ourselves a virtual Live Link subject.

28
00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:50.959
Thanks for watching.

29
00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:51.959
I hope you enjoyed this video.

30
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:52.959
I'll see you in the next one.

31
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:53.959
Bye.

32
00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:54.959
Bye.
