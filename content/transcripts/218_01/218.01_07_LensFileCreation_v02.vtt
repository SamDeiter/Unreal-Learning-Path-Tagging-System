00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
Okay, in this section we're going to simply focus on lens file creation.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.740
This is the latest thing that we need in order to actually do our lens file calibration.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.419
Now the lens file stores the lens distortion parameters, camera intrinsics and nodal point

4
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.019
offset data along with the associated focus and zoom values specific to each lens to camera

5
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.580
combination.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.219
Now let's just jump into the engine here and take a look.

7
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.660
Create the lens file folder that we created earlier and right click in the content browser

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.619
area in order to open up the content browser create events asset menu, move up to the miscellaneous

9
00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.019
section and go ahead and select our lens file.

10
00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.099
Once you've done that, rename it to lens file Zeiss 25 millimeter P3 and double click

11
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.539
it to open it up.

12
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.620
Now the lens file asset editor has multiple calibration tools for automatically populating

13
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.539
the lens file with calibrated data.

14
00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.459
They are your calibration steps tab and the lens file tab and the calibration steps tab

15
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:10.379
contains four sub tabs for lens information, lens distortion, image center and nodal offset.

16
00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.099
Now in order we are going to be using our lens information first and for that we want

17
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:19.979
to make sure that inside this you have viewport settings so you can adjust the transparency

18
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.980
here.

19
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.620
Typically it's set to 0.5.

20
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.820
Choose your camera and make sure you're using the camera that you want to calibrate with

21
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.820
in the engine to match the real world camera so that is our NDC cam black magic Zeiss 25

22
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.980
P and that makes sure our media source is already connected.

23
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.620
Now there is an overlay you can choose for crosshairs and adjust that as well and you

24
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.500
can use that for our image center but we're not going to be using that today.

25
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.560
Instead we are just going to focus on finishing our lens file creation.

26
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.359
So in the lens info under the lens information section you want to make sure that you set

27
00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.640
up some lens info to identify what lens you're using.

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.640
So for this I'm going to use black magic and I'm going to go Zeiss and I'm going to call

29
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.320
this my 25 millimeter P3 because it's prime 3 lens.

30
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.319
If you have the serial number information go ahead and put that in as well.

31
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.000
If you have multiple versions of the same camera type your serial number is generally

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
going to help you know which camera you're actually using.

33
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600
So if you have that information it's going to be helpful to get that.

34
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.080
Next you want to make sure that you modify your sensor dimensions and for the Zeiss it

35
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.400
is the 25.34 millimeter by 14.25 millimeter sensor.

36
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.640
So make sure that these match exactly what the settings are for your camera.

37
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.640
Now your image dimensions here are 1920 by 1080 that's what's coming in for your feed

38
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.160
so you don't necessarily need to make any kind of adjustment in there.

39
00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.719
Now taking a quick look at our lens file panel this allows you to see our focus, our iris

40
00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.599
and some of our other parameters such as focal length, distortion, image center and nodal

41
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.599
offset.

42
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.759
Additionally there is an option for ST maps.

43
00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.240
ST maps here can be loaded in through this section.

44
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.000
Now back to our calibration steps you'll notice if I look down here there is no raw

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.960
fizz input there is no connection in here and there is no evaluated camera settings.

46
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.760
In order to fix that we are going to need to make sure that some of the options that

47
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.680
we have available in here that we'll come back to are connected.

48
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.960
So let's move back into the engine itself and make sure that our lens file that we've

49
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.760
created is available and able to be used inside our camera.

50
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.280
So I'm going to move up to our NDC asset here in the outliner and I'll move down to my NDC

51
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.879
camera here.

52
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.640
Now if I go in here you're going to notice that there are several options and available

53
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.819
functions that are in here such as film back lens settings etc.

54
00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.239
But we're actually going to be tracking our fizz data so we remember we created a live

55
00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.060
link camera controller for our Blackmagic ZEISS fizz and I'm going to click on that

56
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.219
and you'll notice I don't have a subject representation right now.

57
00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.900
So my live link didn't actually remember my default source being connected into my camera's

58
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.840
subject representation.

59
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.219
So I'll save that when I finish here today.

60
00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.579
But in order to get this to work just choose your subject representation for your live

61
00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.060
link virtual subject for your Blackmagic ZEISS.

62
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.740
Now once that's done you'll notice that there are some options available down here including

63
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.740
camera roll.

64
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.699
And we go down to our camera roll we want to actually go down to our camera calibration

65
00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.540
so you can expand them and see that we've got lens file picker and we're going to choose

66
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.500
the lens file that we've created.

67
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.779
Now I can pull this from the lens file that's available in here or I can just drag this

68
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.779
right in.

69
00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:34.379
Now once that's connected if I go back into my lens file one thing to remember before

70
00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.420
we go through here it should be noted that we only support spherical lens models at this

71
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.300
time and that you must match your physical camera sensor to the camera itself.

72
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.860
Once you're done here go ahead and save the camera information.

73
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.659
We'll come back and use this a little bit later when we do our lens distortion mapping

74
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.060
and from here we are ready to go.

75
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.740
Let's move into our lens distortion mapping and get started calibrating our camera.
