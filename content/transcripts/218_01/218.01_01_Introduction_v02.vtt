00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Hello and welcome to your Unreal training.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.240
In this section, the ICVFX calibration,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.220
we'll be covering lens data and mapping.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.380
My name is Kevin Miller and I am your instructor for

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.780
this two-part series and in this course,

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.860
we will cover calibration, camera configuration,

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.580
camera hardware, media profile implementation.

8
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.000
We will do an overview of the tracking solutions,

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.160
talking about the plugins and

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.280
the system options that you have available to you.

11
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.719
We will also talk about camera control systems

12
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.800
and create a virtual live link subject.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.839
We'll talk a little bit about the time data monitor

14
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.399
and adjusting sync and timecode,

15
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.240
then we'll walk through lens file creation

16
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.159
and go through our lens distortion mapping.

17
00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.840
In the second course that follows this,

18
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
we will cover our nodal point calibration as well.
