00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's begin with another view of calibration.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So you're probably wondering, why is calibration required?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, in order to create accurate compositions from CG renders and live video in Unreal Engine,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a virtual camera that accurately simulates the physical camera used to capture the real-world video footage is required.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is also really useful if you're going to do any kind of set extension.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you don't do lens calibration before you do any of your set extension,

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
you're not going to have the data necessary to pass on to the departments requiring that information in order to complete your shots.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The virtual camera position and orientation in these situations must closely match the position and orientation

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the physical camera and the physical camera tracking information

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that must match the exact timing of the video feed to ensure each video frame is accurately synced to the position and orientation of the camera at any given time.

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, when completed correctly, it is possible to evaluate the calibrated lens file for any focus and zoom position by interpolating between the stored focus and zoom points.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now as we go through the calibration process, the camera calibration and OpenCV lens distortion plugins allow Unreal Engine to model the physical lens distortion needed

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to accurately align the virtual camera to the physical camera and introduces the lens file asset used to store all of the calibration data for camera and lenses.

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One thing to note is that the calibrated lens data can vary depending on the camera's focus and zoom.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In order to achieve a high quality calibration, multiple focus and zoom points should be captured during the calibration process.

16
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now, before we get started, I do want to jump into Unreal Engine.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There are a few folders that we need in our calibration folder in order to actually put things in order and keep them organized as we calibrate our camera for the engine.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, you'll see here that I'm over in my content browser and I already have an existing calibration folder.

19
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I also have my media profile and my media profile bundle folder located within my calibration folder.

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So you see here I've got my media profile and my media profile inner assets.

21
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now, the folders I need in my calibration folder are my Aruco wall textures.

22
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So I'm going to go ahead and create a brand new folder and I'm going to name this Aruco Wall Textures.

23
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is going to be used to store our Aruco wall textures in our next course.

24
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Next, we're going to need another new folder. We're going to call this one Checkerboard.

25
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We're going to need this when we create our Checkerboard for calibration of our lens distortion map.

26
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Next, we need to get another folder here that we're going to call Lens Files.

27
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, this is where we're going to keep all the lens files that we create for each individual camera and lens combination.

28
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Any time that you create a new lens and camera combination, you will need a new lens file.

29
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And finally, we're going to create a new folder for NotalPoint.

30
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And this is where we store the objects we use for NotalPoint calibration.

31
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, if you want to stay organized and just keep these separate, you can go ahead and create a new folder

32
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and call this Media Profiles and move your inner assets along with your media bundle, media source, media output,

33
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and media profile in one single location.

34
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It is recommended, though, when you do create your media profiles that you generate this folder before you do that.

35
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now, in order to make sure that you have this working correctly, you'll notice that this folder is now empty

36
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and a duplicate was created inside this Media Profiles folder.

37
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So, that's it for this section. In our next section, we will discuss some of our camera configurations.
