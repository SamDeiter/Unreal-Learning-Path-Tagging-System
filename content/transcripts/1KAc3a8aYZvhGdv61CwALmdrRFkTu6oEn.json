  "text": " And then touching upon the sub scene tracks that we mentioned a moment ago, sub scene tracks can be used inside of sequences. So definitely worth doing a bit more research on these and we've got additional resources at the end of this video series. But you'll recognize this sequence of layout by now we've got the shots along the top. But what you'll see here are some sub scene tracks. So you can see them all listed here and we've got maybe animation, VFX, cameras, lighting, meta sound. And essentially these are almost like modules in their own right. They're still they're nested sequences and it means that multiple people can be working on this sequencer shot or this master file in parallel. So maybe someone setting up the animation for the scene, maybe someone setting up the camera tracking, maybe someone's trying to do a lighting pass. It essentially gives you your own track to be working in, dependent on your role on this sequence. So you can see that the sub scene tracks then can be nested within their own sub scene track. So if we had this animation track here, you could double click this track and then it would load up this sub sequence. And even that sub sequence then has a sub sequence per character in the scene, for example. So depending on how many people are working on the sequencer file, you can quickly organize workflows to suit the departments and the different people that you have working on these so that no one's waiting on other people to finish. Of course, you always have these dependencies like while you can't do a character specific VFX until the character animation is set up, for example. However, it allows you all to be kind of aligned to the same sequence of timings. You can all pre-visualize the shots because the shots are in the master, the higher level sequence, and then all of these are nested sub sequences. So sequencer sub scene tracks are definitely worth exploring in a little bit more detail, especially if you're working with multiple people on your sequencer.",
