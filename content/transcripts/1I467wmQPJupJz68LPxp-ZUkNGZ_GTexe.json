  "text": " So let's look at content cooking now and what does Unreal handle for us by default. So I've tried to include handy documentation links. You'll see the link at the bottom here about cooking content inside of Unreal Engine. But Unreal Engine is stored in particular file formats that are supported for any given platform. So, you know, we mentioned about our textures in the previous slide and maybe you have some audio files or some skeletal mesh data or anything like this. Now this is good for editing and developing purposes, but the target platforms will not want to read all these different formats. So what the cooking process does is it converts them into a format that can be used for the target platform. So you know, depending on the platform that you're wanting to deploy to, whether it's you know, a PC or a console or something like that, there'll be different formats that the platform wants and Unreal Engine handles that through the process of cooking. Now, again, these features are inside of our project settings. So, again, just go to edit project settings if you want to find any of these. But as you saw at the start, we're kind of cooking everything into our project. And it didn't really allow us to select, you know, specific maps, for example. Maybe we have a bunch of, you know, prototype or sandbox maps that we don't want to actually cook into our projects and we just want to select a few things. So a few different maps. So I'll just go through the process of how you might do this. So if we just want, again, just a little bit more refinement, but we only want to cook the maps, for example, and therefore any content within these specific maps. So it'll only find the maps with the content in your content browser. You can go to packaging, advanced, cook only maps. Again, you could search this term in the search box if you wanted to get them. But if you tick this option, this will only affect the maps that you've got in your content browser. So that's one way of doing it. And, you know, it's a tick box, but it helps refine our process a little bit. But if we really want to start getting a bit more specific about which maps we are cooking, there is also a maps to cook section, which, you know, I've just typed in the search box, maps to cook. So you'll be able to find this for yourself. And in this array at the bottom of the screen, you'll see the property at the very bottom of this image, list of maps to include in a package build. Instead of just having a bool, which is that tick box at the top that says, just get all the maps. This will actually give you an array of very specific maps that you want to cook in your package build, which allows us, say we have level one, two, and three, we can include level one, two, and three into this array of maps to package. And any of the maps will be discarded. So if you had, you know, again, prototypes or sandboxes or anything like this that you didn't want to include in the package build, this is yet another way to package certain maps. But if we want to get even more granular than this, for example, so again, we're getting into slightly more detail, slightly more detail. So we do have other settings and features inside of Unreal Engine that will allow you to really customize and get granular focus on some of these asset types. So on the left-hand side, we have the asset manager. And using the asset manager can give you control over which assets are loaded into your game's content. So you'll really have a lot more fine control over that. And I'll share some links for this in the following slide. And then we also have the project launcher that can be useful when packaging for multiple platforms. Say you're trying to deploy again in the example that I used before, maybe a package in for PC and package in for console. You'll want to maybe use this project launcher just for configurations per platform. So as I mentioned, we have this asset manager and the link here is an excellent breakdown. If you're an engineer or want to know about what is being loaded into the game at any given point, I would highly recommend watching this video. It's a live stream from the Unreal Engine live stream and it really breaks down the asset manager in a granular way. So definitely worth watching. But as a high level, the asset manager is a Singleton Global U object, which is like an engine subsystem. So this isn't a map or mode specific. You know, it's just one manager to rule them all. And it categorizes and queries unloaded assets using the asset registry. So it will just have this one global asset load, global asset loading state, which is, you know, what makes it a Singleton like the engine subsystems. So you only ever have one that you can find. It does integrate into existing systems like the cooking and async. And it is designed to be overridden by your game. So this is functionality already built into Unreal Engine that you can then extend and use for your own purposes. So if that sounds like something you need to do, definitely check out the asset manager reference video there because that goes into all the different settings that you can have when extending this. Using the asset manager from an editor perspective is pretty straightforward. Again, we're in a project settings. And this time we're going to the game asset manager. Again, you could just type asset manager in the search bar if you want to. And you'll see here that we have a map type in the index. So in the array in index zero, we've got map type, primary asset type map. And what this is actually looking for, if you look down to the middle bottom of the image, like the lower third of the image, you'll see directories here. And in the index in the directories, you'll see that we're looking for game and then maps. So the really powerful thing about this is that we're looking into a specific folder of which maps to cook here. So why this is useful is say you have inside of your maps folder, critical levels or something like this. You have a folder that's just called critical levels, and you could add this to the directory and say anything in this folder, cook. Anything outside of this folder, you don't cook. And you could have these different folders. Again, this is an array, so we could pick multiple different folder structures. But the powerful thing about this is that I don't need to go in. And when level three comes online, I don't have to go back into the previous maps to cook that we showed two slides ago that says, okay, now I need to add level three to cook. Now I need to add level four. If you had 50 levels in your game, you could imagine bugs might happen. You might miss a level, something. If you added each level individually to the maps to cook, you might run into issues there. You can do it, but it might be more time consuming and error prone. Whereas this approach just says any level inside this folder, go ahead and cook. So that's another way of thinking about how you want to cook maps. This can be applied for different asset types. Of course, I'm just using maps here as an example, but it shows you the power of going from just opening the editor and clicking package my game for Windows and taking the kitchen sink approach to getting more granular using the asset manager. So as we mentioned, we also have the project launcher. And this gives us the ability to deploy for different platforms, all in a centralized location from a single launch profile. So again, we've got the documentation link at the bottom left-hand side here. So if you'd like to know more about the project launcher, if you're working on games that are just for more than one platform, you'll probably want to start thinking about using the project launcher to make things a little bit easier to manage. So the project launcher has its own default launch profile. So you can see here, I've got a default launch profile for Windows. And I can choose to create custom profile that enables me to build a project that has many different advanced settings. So you can see that I've got a custom launch profile here called awesome profile, which is going to be the best possible settings for my project here. And you can configure different launch profiles, again, depending on what you're wanting to use on the different platforms. So you can actually use this tool for testing DLC or patching and just different organizational things. So if you are running into more of a commercial game project, it might be delivering on different platforms. You may have patches and DLC content, things like this. Like the project launcher will definitely be a go-to. And I think it's a note here. You'll see where I mentioned the Windows Pete Home here. If I was on a network that had development kits enabled and different PCs in the network, you'd be able to see all these different devices listed here. So you can set that up and the device manager, as you can see the little clickable link there. But you can imagine the project launcher being really powerful, again, if you're trying to ship your projects on multiple platforms here. Now, when we're talking about the actual cook process, we tend to just want to highlight these two different options. So we've got Cook by the Book and Cook on the Fly. And for 90% of you, if not more, you'll probably be going with Cook by the Book. However, if you're an engineer wanting to iterate on quick changes, you might want to Cook on the Fly. But let's just look about what this entails. So we have Cook by the Book. And Cook by the Book performs the entirety of the cook process ahead of time, allowing for the build to deploy all the cooked assets at once. So this is what we did at the start of the tutorial here and the start of the course. We just, Cook by the Book, we waited for everything to cook and package to turn into executable. And then that's the content that we played. So this option is really useful for developers who are not wanting to iterate on individual assets. And you're just trying to test your game. So this is generally for performance testing and play test, things like this. So that'll be the default probably for a lot of you. However, we do have the Cook on the Fly option. And it will delay cooking until after the game has been deployed. So I'm going to break down the different stages of actually packaging and what this goes through in a few slides here. But you actually delay the cooking process until after the game has been deployed, which means I can just deploy the game very quickly. But also it uses the network communication with a Cook server to make requests on demand. And then the content is cooked on as and when it's needed. So this is for fast iteration. So if things have already been cooked and you just want to deploy, you know, you can deploy the build relatively quickly and then it'll only be cooking content as and when it gets to the content that needs cooking. So, you know, if you're trying to bug test or really find this one thing and you don't want to wait for a full build to be deployed, Cook on the Fly might be an option for you there.",
