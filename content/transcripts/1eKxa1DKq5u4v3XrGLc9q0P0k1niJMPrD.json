  "text": " Hello, and welcome to this video on example number three, customizing editor on startup. So back in the engine, and for this we are on slide nine, example three, startup scripts. So what we're looking here is another trigger point, and this is for us to tie code to the startup of the engine. Now, in order to do this, what we need to do is we need to come up and go project settings, and I'm going to search for Python. So we have the Python script here. Now what's interesting is we haven't actually looked at the plugin and the options which were available to us yet, realistically, and there are only a couple which I think are quite important. We've got the Python pip install in case you want to use that. We've got enable remote execution as well, something I've already tried. But here is the button for isolate the interpreter environment. So without this, it's going to be able to look elsewhere for the Python. And we've got an option here to add additional paths. So we can manually add paths into the project. But what we've also got above this is startup scripts. And these are scripts which we can get the editor to run at the point that it starts up. Now, I only have one script in at the moment, and what this would do is it fires up the teaching aid. So the editor utility widget, which I've created that allows us to move through the project, I wanted this to start up as people start up the project. And I couldn't force that. So the only way I've been able to do it is by using Python to fire that up. And you can see that we have that here under we are load asset teaching aid and spawn and register the tab here. So this is a good example of what you might use startup for. However, in our example, I'm going to do something a little bit more complicated with the startup. What we're going to do is we are going to add some functionality to the editor itself. So we're going to change how the editor is set up. So if I come back into the main lesson, I have this node here. And in the details panel, I've got a big script. So I'm just going to copy and paste this. So I select all and copy that. I'm then going to jump into the project settings and I will paste this in here. Now, because this is on startup, in order for us to see this, we are going to have to tell it to restart. And now the engine is fine back up again. So what's different? But the first thing is the top here, you can see that we have a Python and this has a couple of different options in it. So drop down, you can see that open code folder. What this will do is it will open up my code folder for my Python. So just a quick and easy way of opening that up. And the other one is going to fire up the web page. So this will fire up our web page for the API. So this is an example. We can have numerous different sort of settings here, but it's creating our own drop down. We have also added in and we'll look at this later. We've added in an option to the add interface here, so Python task selections at the bottom. So this has allowed me to edit the menu system that we've got. So let's jump back into the project settings and have a look at that script. It might be a little bit hard to see. You might want to go away and have a look at it yourself. But what we're doing is we are creating extra menus. So we are an extra menu sort of settings within Python. It's a little bit complicated to explain, but it's well worth going over this. So do have a look at that in your own time. So now if we were to have a bit of a closer look at these scripts, one of the things that I think is important here is we have how we define where our menus are set. So you can see we have an option here to extend menu. We have to provide it with a menu. So content browser, asset, content menu. Now, getting this isn't an obvious thing. So if you want to find and add a section into one of these menus, you're going to need to know how to get a hold of these values. So let's go through that quickly. So to do that, I'm going to actually use a command here, a Cval, so console command. So I'm going to convert back to the console command. And I'm going to type in, and it is tool menus dot edit one. And soon as I turn that on, you can see that we get these cogs that appear next to each of the different menus. So if I look here, you can see we have content browser, asset, content menu. So if we compare that to our script, content browser, asset, content menu. So you can see that's what I want to extend. So I can now get hold of it. I've right-hand clicked and I could copy a reference to that or I could come in and edit. Now, these appear everywhere. If you look through all of them, you're going to see they appear at the top. So it's nice and a quick way to get hold of any of these different menus. But that's how you figure out what the reference value is. You can come in and edit these menus. So here it is from the slides. So you can just see it a little bit clearly. That is how we get hold of these different references. Now, it's worth noting before we get off of this topic that you don't have to place it in the startup. Unreal is actually going to search for the file in it unreal.py in any of the paths that are available to it and run that at startup as well. So if you don't want to have to edit it from the project settings, you would just want to dump something into the project files. That's a good way to do it. And that's everything for example number three, customizing editor on startup. In the next video, we'll be jumping into example four.",
