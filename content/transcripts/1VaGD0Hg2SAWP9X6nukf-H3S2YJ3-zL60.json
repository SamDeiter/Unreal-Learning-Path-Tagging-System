  "text": " So to start off today in virtual production, let's talk about the animation workflows and best practices found here. So you'll see here's a virtual production. You'll see the overview of the development and pre-production here. We've got production next and then post-production. And you'll see this is a kind of traditional Unreal Engine pipeline going through the various stages, constantly having Unreal Engine as this iteration. So it's worth spending a few minutes just looking at this scene where all the different roles fit. But what we'll do today is we'll break down a traditional pipeline and then also how you might think about including Unreal Engine inside of your pipeline. So here's a typical animation studio pipeline setup. You have the story development, some kind of story, department and boards being created here. You then move into production design and asset construction. You start prepping the scenes with all the modeling, rigging, you know, surfacing scene assembly content that you may need here. Then we're going to block in, creating some layouts, iterating on the rough layouts and then come into final layout. With final layout, you'd bring in the final animation performances. And then you've got this back and forth between editorial and layout as the production hub there. Once we're happy with all the layout, we go into the enhancements, whether it be stereo, crowds, character effects, effect simulations, the Mac department. We'll get all of the kind of bells and whistles going and then we'll output the image here for lighting and the render and composition to create the final editorial. Of course, you have sound design along the way and you have editorial, iterating and making sure everything looks correct. So thinking about a different style of pipeline, and although on the offset this may look more complex, it's actually a lot more streamlined and simpler with allowing for a lot of iterations. So the teal colors that you'll see here are traditional pipelines found in your DCCC. And also the purple color are the Unreal Engine integrations where you can constantly iterate and improve on the content before it gets to this final editorial. So on a high level, let's just touch upon the two before coming back to this image. So we've got the practical differences here. On the left, we've got the traditional CG animation pipeline and on the right, we've got the real time animation pipeline. Taking the traditional CG animation pipeline first, we front load the story process as we mentioned before. We deliberate shot construction processes. We have editorial and layout as a production hub. We've got a team governed after pre-production process. It's less interactive. Once you start getting to those final comps, you want to make sure everything is locked in based on that final layout. Otherwise, it's very time consuming to go back and change that content. And you've also got layered rendering output. With the real time animation pipeline, we've got an integrated story process. So we've got a lot of iteration going on throughout this story process. We've got the live action shot construction process. We've got Sequencer as the main production hub. So Sequencer is this tool that we'll be digging into in a short while here, but very versatile and open to iteration. We've got a director centric during the entire process. So the director, instead of just in the initial layout stages, making all the key decisions, we can constantly iterate even through lighting and any of those post effects that you may have been seeing. We can still have the director very present here. We've got more interaction on the revision process and we've got final pixels. So coming back to this image, you'll see a highlight here through the kind of blocking and performance capture into animation. So these can all be iterated upon using the Sequencer tool. We can keep updating animations and reimporting them and making sure that performance is really locked in there. In the world and shot definition in point six here, you've got a reindex conform and the sub level definition into Sequencer second assembly. So they're the kind of big layout changes that you'll see in this section here. And you've also got the shot enhancements. So lighting effects, Sims, post process. And again, these can all be iterated upon throughout production. You may even want to tackle some of these from the start to kind of get some look and feel. Maybe you want to touch upon some post process earlier on in the composition. And with this kind of real time animation pipeline, you can achieve these kind of visualization effects quite early on to kind of set a tone or a feel to the output. And then you've also got the UE5 rendering capabilities there to the final editorial. So hopefully that gives you a good overview of kind of the main comparisons between a traditional pipeline versus a real time pipeline. And it gives you something to think about on how you may approach your own productions. And so talking about what the animation workflow might practically look like in engine, let's go over a pipeline here. So we've got the character asset construction. And again, just to remind you, the tealy colors are your DCC and the purple color is going to be your Unreal Engine. So however you'd like to model the character rig, surface in, however you usually approach these pipelines, you can approach them. Or you could use the MetaHuman Creator, which is the new tool found inside of Unreal Engine. Once you've got your character asset, you can go into your performance capture and animation into layout of the sequencer. And then we want to break down what the actual sequencer and animation track pipeline may look like. So this is what we're talking about in this big diagram here. And I'll just go over a few of these notes to just break down the process. So when we're using control rig and the inverse solve at the top here, we want to import the performance capture, the animation where you can duplicate, trim and edit these clips. You can apply animations to character assets in sequences. So once we have that character asset inside of sequencer, it will have its own track that you can assign, which you can add the animations to in them. We can create animation assembly subtracts, which is applying bone matching and animation blends. And again, I'm just going through these diagrams here on the right hand side. And then we want to inverse solve so you can bake that down to the control rig. We can adjust with the control rig using additive tracks. And then we can also bake new animation sequences, which we've got a little asterisk here, which I'll go over in a second. And then we can also apply it to the character asset. So when we're baking new animation sequences, it is optional for saving refined animation there. And then also when you apply it to the character asset, these workflows can vary. So steps can be repeated to refine animation tracks. You can iterate in whichever part of the process here. But essentially, you are importing the animation, adding the character into sequencer, adjusting whatever settings you want to use. You can do whatever settings you need there and then also then applying the animation to that sequence. And before we wrap up this section, it'd be good to go over some workflow and best practices using your monitors, whether you're using a single monitor or a dual monitor. We'll talk about the layouts and the different options you have at your disposal here. So if you're just looking for a single monitor, we may have two different viewports. So you may have viewport one, which is found here on the left hand side, which is this split viewport. You have your default view and your cinematic view. So it allows you to not only move around in the engine and see what shots you might be composing. You also have the actual cinematic view of what we're looking at through sequences. So I'll get to this in a second, but you'll see sequencer down here and you'll see this little camera icon, which is what the camera is seeing. And that's essentially what this output is giving you. And you could also have a second viewport, which has your user preferences on there as well. These can all be changed using your editor layout settings. So it's completely up to you how you configure this. But if we just talk about the dock tabs and tools before showing other examples, that what we'll do is we'll go counterclockwise. So we'll go from the top here down and along and then up. So we've got the place actors tab, which is found here. That will usually be there by default. And you'll you'll be changing place actors using this drop down here on the select mode, which you can access a variety of tools in Unreal Engine. But for our purposes now, we just want to be in the place actors zone. You have your content browser on the bottom left where you'll find all the different content in your editor, whether it's a sequence of files, animation files, level files, any kind of files you have in your content. You'll be able to look through here. You've got your sequence, which sequence is docked here. And this is where you have all of your actors in the scene, whether it be cameras or characters. And you'll also be able to edit curves here as well. So sequence of curves is a little pop up there. And you can actually open the curve window editor using this little button here. So if you only have your sequence of window and you want to open the curves, you can just click that little button there. Then we have our take recorder, which is optional. It depends if you're recording any live content inside of Unreal Engine. Take recorder is a very powerful tool. So if you're not familiar with it, definitely check that out as well. Then we have our outliner of all the content in our level. So you'll see any of the actors in this scene placed here. So whereas in sequencer, we only care about the actors that are in this specific shot in the outliner. You'll see everything that is within the entire map that you have open. And then we have the details, multi-user and live link windows down here, which we will have opened for various purposes. Details is more than likely always going to be open because that will give you a detail per actor that you select. So say you select a camera, you'll be able to change all the camera settings in there. If you select a light, you'd be able to change all the light settings. And then the multi-user, if you've got a multi-user session open and live link, that would just be a nice layout to look at there. If we're using a single monitor and we're looking purely at animation, maybe our viewpoint number one is still just a large viewpoint instead of splitting it down the middle. Maybe we just want to see the viewpoint. Maybe you're not animating per shot and you just want to get the animation visible in the level. Then that's how you can do this. And then similarly, we've got the place actors tab pinned here. We've got the content browser there. And then we've also got on the right hand side. So if we look at the right doc now, because the left doc was pretty similar to last setup, whereas the right doc has the main changes here. So we've got our animation window. We've got animation outliner where you can see the hierarchies. And then you've also got the outliner details, levels and anim details panels there. And then you've also got the multi-user and live link. So you can see the kind of differences between if you're editing cameras and shots versus animation. And then if you have a dual monitor, we are even an ultra wide, shall I say, you could have your first monitor just with the shot and your content. Maybe some of the details and you've still got your multi-user and live links or any kind of content editing here. And then on your right hand monitor, you may have all the animation content editing. So you can see shot versus animation. It's important to note that the engine layout is entirely customizable to your preferences or projects based on working needs. As users get more comfortable using Unreal Engine, you may want to create your own custom layouts. And if you want to do that, you can go to window at the top of the toolbar at the top of the window there. Go to layout and you can save the layout and then you can save your layout as so. They will be saved in your editor settings, config files as well. So if you save multiple layouts, they can be overwritten by selecting a single user layout from the save layout menu. So you may want to save multiple layouts depending on where you might be working or the content that you might be working on. So you can quickly switch between rather than having to repin lots of windows. You may just want to toggle through different layouts. So definitely worth considering getting your workflow layout defined to whatever you're currently working on. So it saves you time.",
