  "text": " Using the right motion capture system is important in getting the right data for your needs. Two of the most used types of systems are optical and inertial. You can capture most of what you need with either, but each does have use cases they can be more suited for. Optical systems have cameras that track light coming off of markers that performer wears. The markers can either be passive, where they reflect light emitted from the system, that is at a specific wavelength. Markers in the cameras pick up this light and send the data to the system. You can also have active markers which emit their own light. Either way the system uses this data to calculate where the markers are. With optical systems having multiple cameras tracking multiple markers you'll get very accurate tracking both vertically and horizontally. This will make going over, under obstacles, up and down ramps and stairs track very well. How you set up your cameras will determine the space or volume in which you will be able to capture. This means you can customize your space to fit your needs, whether you need to capture a long run or aim your cameras higher for wire work or going up those ramps. Just make sure that cameras can see the markers and you'll get good data. If you find yourself needing more room you can add more cameras, network switches and other hardware to increase your volume size. Inertial systems have sensors that detect the rotation or movement of the performer. The sensors are usually placed on the body part so that you get feedback from those movements. Inertial systems are usually compact, fitting in a single case. This makes them great for taking to different locations. We have captured at climbing gym and outdoor obstacle courses as well as other places. Inertial systems track translation based off the rotation data they're receiving. While this can introduce some drift, this can be fixed in post. So recently they've started to integrate virtual reality systems with the inertial systems. You can attach a virtual reality tracker on a performer and use that to help strengthen the translation tracking. For hand tracking, optical systems have built-in mark assets that include tracking fingers, meaning you don't have to buy anything else to capture the hand data and the data is in sync with the body data. You just have to be careful of the markers getting included with all the different uses the hands can perform. Glove systems use inertial sensors and stretch sensors to detect what the hands are doing. This keeps occlusion from being an issue. Some body systems even allow the glove data to be directly fed into the body system software, allowing the data to be synced during body capture. A great benefit of glove systems is you don't have to capture at the same time as the body. We have had animators with a glove system at home play back body data and do the hand performance then. Using face data helps complete a performance. You'll often need a helmet, a boom arm, and a camera to place at the end of the boom that will be aimed at the performer's face. Optical systems can have face tracking included. Again makes it easier because you have the data synced in with the body data. One thing about this though is you may not get a live view, a live feedback of the face data as you often have to process the face data first. There are marvelous face systems that can also be added to either optical or inertial body capture. A very accessible and easy to use solution is the iPhone loaded with the Live Link Face app. It tracks the face and sends the data straight into Unreal. There are also other solutions, very high end solutions that are available. Systems like that of CubicMotions provide very high quality data. They have multiple cameras tracking the face and the system is calibrated to each performer giving very detailed performances. Like with glove systems, you can also use marvelous face solutions in post after you capture the body data. You can even prop up an iPhone at your home computer and supply the face data for your performance. Selecting the right system will make sure the data you capture will be what your project needs. Each vendor is happy to talk with you to help you out so you can feel free to reach out to whatever vendor you're looking at. You can also reach out to Motion Capture Studios that rent their services. Once we've made the decision on what system to get, we can set up for a session.",
