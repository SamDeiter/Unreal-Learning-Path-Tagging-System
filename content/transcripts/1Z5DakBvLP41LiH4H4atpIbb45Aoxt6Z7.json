  "text": " Unreal Engine 5's Blueprint Editor is one of its most powerful tools, as this allows you to create C++ code without actually having to write or know that much about C++ code. This is achieved by laying down various nodes and then connecting them in a flowchart-like manner in order to construct game logic or interactivity. Blueprints can be simple assets that just contain a mesh or a light, or they can be very complex and even have the ability to call other Blueprints within Blueprints. Let's pop over to the Editor now and just take a look at these briefly to get a better understanding of what we're working with here. I'm going to hit Ctrl-Space on my keyboard, and then I'm going to make sure that I have my Blueprint classes here. These are all the various Blueprints that are in this particular project. For example, I can pull out this Blueprint ceiling light here. Let me just pull this up. We can see here that this is a light. If I come over here, you can see I have a brightness, and I have a color property here that I can adjust, and I have a source radius. I'm going to select this, and I'm going to hit Ctrl-E on my keyboard, and that's going to open up the Blueprint Editor. This is our Blueprint Editor. The Blueprint Editor has three main parts. There's a viewport, which represents our visual part. If our Blueprint needs to have some type of visual component, our viewport is where we position it and make sure that everything is the way we want it to look. Then we have the event graph and the construction script. The event graph is functional when we press play. When I press the play button right here, things that happen inside of the event graph will fire off. The construction script, on the other hand, this works when I'm inside of the editor. The construction script, when I go ahead and set something like the brightness here, notice that the construction script is firing off. That's again because we're telling that construction script to change the brightness, and we do that inside of our event graph. Now, as again, as I come through here, we're going to have a bunch of different things that I can do. Here's another Blueprint for Echo. This will take just a second. I think it hasn't been compiled, so give us just a second here. Did I lose it? Let's just bring it right there. There we go. Here is our Echo. If I was to hit Ctrl E on this, we're going to notice a much more complicated Blueprint here. We're going to take a look at the open. It looks like I actually opened up the demo display. Let me close that. I meant to grab her and hit Ctrl E. There we go. Here we go. Here's her construction script. It's setting up her hair, it looks like. Here's the event graph. It looks like it's doing some stuff with the hair. Here's our viewport. Over here we have our components which contain different things like there's the stuff for her hair. A lot of stuff around her hair on this. But again, the Blueprint Editor is a super, super powerful tool that allows anybody, whether they be a level designer, a technical artist, regular artist, or even just a regular designer, the ability to block out code or experiment in ways that just haven't been possible before. So, that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you found it helpful. I'll see you in the next one. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
