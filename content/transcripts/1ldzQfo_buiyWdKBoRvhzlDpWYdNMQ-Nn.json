  "text": " Hi, today we're going to be covering the basics of capturing data on a MetaHuman using Take Recorder. There's plenty of documentation about Take Recorder out there already, but there's some slight differences when using a MetaHuman that you'll want to be aware of. So we've got our MetaHuman here in our scene, so we'll go ahead and add him into Take Recorder. So I'm just going to select him here in the outliner, drag him in, and we're going to make sure that he's set to Possessable today. Alright, so one thing to note before we record is that I've got the Disable Post-Process Blueprint flag on under the body details here, and that just can help with deformations when you're looking at live data coming into a MetaHuman. So just to show how that works, Jerry, can you raise one of your legs up? And then we'll turn that off, and you can see how he gets this bulge there on the thigh that doesn't look right if that Post-Process Blueprint is active. So when we turn that off, turn the Post-Process Blueprint off, it solves that. Alright, thanks Jerry. So if we look down here in the details of the MetaHuman, we can see that there's a lot of stuff we've got set here to record, and if we record all of this stuff, it's going to take a long time to save, and we probably don't need all that data, so we can prune this list down a little bit. So we'll turn off everything but the face and body. So I've got the body on, I've got the face, so we're going to turn off all these hair bits, and we're going to turn off the clothing for the torso, legs, feet, and the hoodie. So that'll drastically reduce the amount of things that Take Recorder is trying to record. Now if you wanted to record exactly how Unreal simulates all these pieces of clothing during your capture, then you can leave those on. So now we'll make sure we've got our face coming in, we've got our Mobu source added. Jerry, can you smile for us? Alright, that's coming in just great. Okay, so I think we're ready to record. Basically, the little run through of what we're going to do here is we're going to have Jerry walk up and say hello to us and wave and talk a little bit and then we'll cut. That'll be our recording. Alright, so let's make sure we've got a little countdown going. Alright, we've got our countdown set to three seconds. Alright Jerry, you ready? Okay, recording in three, two, one, and we're rolling. Alright Jerry, pretend I said something funny. Okay, alright, thank you. Alright, and let's cut there. So we're going through recording all those pieces. So if we had left all those on, this would take considerably longer because there's about a hundred things that we'd be trying to record right now. We'll let that finish up. Alright, so now let's review that last recording and there's a button up here in Take Recorder that does exactly that. We'll go to review and there we go. We can scrub that data. So let's just watch it back through to make sure it all came in. Alright, got the face going. Alright, everything looks good. We've got a successful recording on a MetaHuman. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching.",
