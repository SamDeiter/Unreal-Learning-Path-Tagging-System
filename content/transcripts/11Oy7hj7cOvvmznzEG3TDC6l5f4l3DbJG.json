  "text": " So now that we know what simulates the will of the AI agent, it's time to look at what drives the logic and the memory behind the AI agent. The behavior tree can be best described as the brain of the AI. In fact, the behavior tree component inherits directly from the brain component. The behavior tree component is held by the AI controller and indeed makes a clear assumption that it's owned by an AI controller, with functions such as getAIOwner being made available to programmers. It's also strongly paired with a blackboard component, exposing functions to developers that allow us to retrieve the blackboard component from the behavior tree directly. It's important to note that although the ownership pairing has been established in the code architecture, the AI controller does not come with a brain component already attached. This can be done by a developer through Blueprint or C++, however. Lastly, if you choose to add the behavior tree component through Blueprint, the native C++ code of the AI controller will automatically search for a brain component on itself and set its own member variables accordingly. The behavior tree component allows developers to plug in their desired behavior tree in the editor and have it be ran immediately upon possession. Alternatively, we can explicitly call runBehaviorTree ourselves and pass through a specific tree as and when we find it suitable. If a behavior tree component is not present when calling runBehaviorTree, then one will be created for you. The behavior tree component is in charge of running our AI logic, that being the behavior tree asset. As already mentioned, it will start the AI logic on possession and stop AI logic on unpossess. It will also tick the behavior tree directly for us. We can also use it to pause the behavior tree's logic. The brain component on the AI also features a special messaging system that the AI logic can utilize. You'll find examples of these already in the engine. These messages allow us to know what may have gone on during the processing of a piece of AI logic. For example, in our move to task, we can determine whether or not we succeeded or failed in our move. This will determine whether or not we proceed onto the next node in the tree or fail the whole node in its entirety. A behavior tree allows an AI agent to do their thinking and make decisions that drive their functionality. A behavior tree can be paired with a blackboard to efficiently make decisions, although it isn't strictly necessary to use one. However, it is still highly recommended that you do use a blackboard. As we mentioned previously, the blackboard component and the behavior tree component have been strongly paired in the code architecture. Behavior trees are created within the editor, as can be seen in the image here. We simply right-click in the content browser, go to the artificial intelligence category, and select the behavior tree option. Behavior trees are built in a hierarchical set of nodes that control the flow of decision making, which we're going to cover shortly. In Unreal, behavior trees are event-driven, which avoids doing unnecessary polling every frame. The behavior tree passively listens for events that can then be used to trigger changes in the tree. This type of code architecture means that we do not need to iterate over the entire tree every tick, so instead we rely on the messages to inform us of these changes. They also help with debugging behavior trees, as we can simply only show the relevant information at the time that it was being executed. Here we've got an example of a simple behavior tree, in which the AI agent can either move towards the player and attack them, or if they've not yet perceived a player, they will patrol randomly until they do perceive one. Behavior tree branches are executed in order. When authoring your own behavior trees, you'll notice that all of the nodes have been assigned a number when they're placed in the graph. This numerical value tells us the order in which these nodes will be executed, so at the higher level, the behavior tree executes top to bottom, whilst on a branch level, we execute left to right. This is critical to understand when authoring your own behavior trees. You wouldn't want an AI agent to prefer patrolling to chasing and engaging with the player. It's also important to understand that nodes in the behavior tree can be moved around and update their execution order based on their position at runtime, so clean and well spaced out behavior trees are a must. So on the previous slide, behavior trees come with their own editor graph, and as such have their own graph nodes. Behavior trees are made up of five types of node, that being the root node, composite nodes, task nodes, decorator nodes, and service nodes. So let's take a look at what each one of these do. The root node is the default node found in all behavior trees, and it serves as the starting point for a behavior tree, and thus cannot be deleted. This unique node within the tree has got a few special rules. Firstly, the root node can only have one connection, and if that connection to the root node is removed, then the entire tree is disabled. Next, it does not support attaching of decorators or service nodes. And lastly, the root node does not have any inherent properties. However, when you select it, you'll be shown the properties of the behavior tree on the whole. As we can see with this example, selecting the root node allows us to set the behavior tree's blackboard. So now we've got a root node, but in its own right, it doesn't really do a lot. This is where the composite nodes come in. Composite nodes define the root of a branch. As well as this, they also determine the rules for how a branch is executed, and we'll see how each one of the composite nodes goes on to define these in the following slides. Another important thing to note about composite nodes is that they are the only type of node that can be attached to that root node. Composite nodes support both decorator and service nodes, and decorators allow us to control how we either enter the branch or even cancel out mid-execution. Services will only ever be active if the children of the composite node are being executed. This is important to understand when we come to actually placing our service nodes. There are three types of composite nodes that we can use, that being the selector, the sequence, and the simple parallel. Let's find out how each of these differ and what they offer to the engineer when developing our AI. Let's start with the selector node. The selector node will execute its children from left to right, and it will stop executing when one of its children succeeds in its task. If a child succeeds, then the selector node itself succeeds. If all of its children fail, then the selector node itself will fail. We can see as an example on the right that the selector composite node will attempt to execute the first wait task, however its decorator will cause it to fail after one second, thus failing the task. Instead of failing straight away, the selector node will execute the secondary wait task and thus succeed. If we were to place the secondary task ahead of the first, we would see that the task would succeed and the second would not run. On the left we can see that this composite node also exposes two variables to developers, the first being applied decorator scope. If set, all decorators in the branch below will be removed when execution flow leaves this branch, but decorators on this node in particular will not be affected. Lastly we have the node name, and this is just the readable name that this node should be assigned when being displayed in the behaviour graph editor. It's usually a good idea to name your composite nodes as it acts as a way to identify what this branch of your behaviour tree is trying to do, especially useful when your behaviour tree starts to grow in size. Selectors are ideal for branches in which any sub-branch may perform a task, but it does not matter which one of them is actually executed. Next we have sequence nodes. Sequences also execute their children from left to right much like the selector, but a sequence node will stop executing once one of its children fails. If a child fails, the whole sequence node will fail. Conversely, if all the sequences' children succeed, then the sequence will succeed. In the example on the right we can see there are three wait tasks, with each executing one after the other. If we were to place a similar condition to any of the other task nodes like we did in the selector example, we would see that the sequence would fail immediately and not execute any of the children following the task that failed. Sequences are ideal for things such as moving towards a target, as we would likely run an environment query to find out a location to move to, then proceed to that location. On the left we can see a similar set of properties that we would see in the selector node and they do exactly the same thing. Lastly we have the simple parallel node. The simple parallel node allows a single main task node to be executed alongside a full tree. When the main task finishes, depending on what finish mode we have selected, the other tree will either be aborted immediately or will simply wait until it finishes. Simple parallel nodes are great for things such as moving continuously whilst also shooting. Decorator nodes are the next type of node that we need to look at. They can be attached to either composite or task nodes, but they cannot be placed on their own. They define whether a node or branch can be executed at all and they are also known as conditionals in other behaviour tree systems. Lastly decorator nodes can also be used to abort parts of a behaviour tree, allowing us to bail out of the execution of a branch midway through that execution. So on to task nodes. The task nodes are nodes that do things, so for example move on an AI or editing a blackboard key. Task nodes support both decorator and service nodes. And other than composite nodes, task nodes are the only other node type that can be placed down onto the behaviour graph itself. There's a wide choice of tasks already implemented in Unreal, one of which we can already see in the example below, that being the move to task. Much like decorator nodes, we can create our own task nodes in both blueprint and in C++. And lastly we're going to come to services. Services are nodes that will execute at a defined frequency when their branch is being executed. Services can be used to perform checks or update data about the world that can then be used in place of parallel nodes that you might have otherwise used in other behaviour tree systems. Unreal comes with two services supported out of the box, the first being default focus. This service will set the focus actor directly on the AI controller. This can be especially useful for gain hold of a said actor in blueprint or C++, instead of having to access the data directly on the blackboard. The second is run EQS. This service can be used to regularly run an environment query system template as an assigned interval and will update the given blackboard value with the result. Lastly it's important to note that although services do tick, you don't have to use them in that way. Services come with functions that allow developers to know when a service has come into relevancy of the tree and when it has ceased to be relevant, so they don't have to be ticking all of the time. So now that we know all the different types of nodes that we have access to, we should discuss how you utilise memory in the behaviour tree. Behaviour tree nodes exist as shared objects, meaning that all AI agents using the same behaviour tree will share the same single set of node instances. This approach has a two-fold effect. The first is that it improves CPU performance and secondly it reduces memory usage. It does however come with a caveat, that being that the shared nodes cannot store agent specific data in their headers. However, if we do find ourselves needing to store agent specific data, Unreal offers support to do so in three different ways. So let's cover the first way in which you can do so, that would be instancing your nodes. Behaviour tree nodes expose out a bool that allows us as developers to instance the node and this is the be create node instance parameter. If this is set to true, then this will grant each AI agent using this behaviour tree a unique instance of that node. This will of course allow us to store some agent specific data with the downside of actually having a higher memory and CPU cost to a non-instance version of the node. There are examples of usage of these node types within Unreal's own implementation, such as the play animation task and the run behaviour dynamic task. The second way in which we can get around this is by using the blackboard storage. The blackboard storage can be accessed within nodes to get agent specific data and key functions in our nodes sent through the AI agents behaviour tree component as one of its parameters. As developers we can simply expose an F name property to make use of a blackboard key selector to allow us to get and set data from and to the blackboard. It's important to note that this approach will only support blackboard data types which we're going to discuss in just a second. And lastly we've got the node memory. Unreal allows developers to create a custom struct or class to store variables inside the node's memory. Many of the functions in behaviour tree nodes pass through a Uint8 pointer parameter and this parameter indicates the block of memory that has been allocated to our AI agent. The get instance memory size function, which must be implemented if we're going to use the memory approach, will dictate the size of this block of memory. Nodes will allocate this amount of memory for each AI agent and the node memory is stored in a single continuous block to optimise performance. However it's very important to keep in mind that node memory is not part of the U object ecosystem, so our memory is not visible to the garbage collector. It's highly recommended that when dealing with reflection types that we make use of the T week object pointer to hold your variable. We can see an example of how this is done on the images on the slide and this example is lifted from the move to task already implemented in Unreal. So now we've covered the simulated will of the AI and the brains of the AI. Now we need to discuss the memory of the AI. The blackboard is a special asset type that is created specifically to work in conjunction within the behaviour tree. It's used to store information in the shape of a blackboard key. This information can then be queried by the behaviour tree at runtime to make informed decisions. A blackboard can store up to 255 entries and they can also support parent blackboards. This means we can inherit keys from other blackboards. The blackboard component offers programmers the entryway for querying and saving data to and from the blackboard respectively. The blackboard component is strongly paired to the behaviour tree component. It will cache the component and programmers can retrieve the brain component of the AI directly from the blackboard component. The blackboard component also follows a similar pattern to the behaviour tree component in terms of creation. It's not present by default on the AI controller and much like the behaviour tree component, it can either be added via blueprints or C++. However, this isn't necessary as one will be created when the AI logic is triggered to start. But it's also important to note that the blackboard is not essential to running the AI logic as we mentioned earlier. Again, much like the behaviour tree component, the blackboard component does expose a blackboard asset to the editor which can be plugged directly. The blackboard component also offers a unique callback functionality that allows objects to register as observers of a particular blackboard key so that they can be notified when that blackboard value has changed. A blackboard can store the following data types. We can store a lot of our expected basic types such as vector, rotator, bool, in32, float and string as well as enum. But we can also store some much more unreal specific types such as the F name, U object and U class. If you wish to look at how data for each of these keys is actually manipulated, then we'd highly recommend you take a look at the blackboard key all types header which will give us a handy include for all of the types that we listed above. Lastly, it's important to note that a blackboard cannot store arrays of data. The blackboard works off of a single block of memory and data types are stored with offsets based off of their data size.",
