  "text": " Okay, so to close out this course, we're going to be building a very simple cloth material. And to do that, we'll have to take a look at the shading model to set up as cloth, and also just set up the cloth in general and, you know, building a material that looks a bit like cloth. So just the topic to cover before this is that the shading model to change in the material is going to essentially mean a few things change for the material itself. When we change the shading model to cloth, it's going to simulate a fuzz layer that will produce a more realistic effect that looks like cloth. And the major nose that we're going to take a look at this and that are going to become available in our material because of changing the shading model is going to be for fuzz color and cloth. Now, the fuzz color enables you to add color to your material to simulate shifts when light passes through that sort of clothy surface. And then the cloth section itself, which enables you to control the strength of that fuzzy surface as a whole. Always with this kind of thing, a value of zero indicates that there's no fuzz contribution at all, whereas a value of one fully blends the cloth all over the entirety of the base color, which would be a very rare instance in which you use a value of one fully, but we can take a look at it. So let's go ahead and see how we build this material up. I'm going to right click here and make a new material. I'm going to call it M underscore cloth. Keep it nice and simple. And we're going to build essentially the material you see here, which is a ripped cloth sort of idea. Now let's take a look at it. Open up the material. And first things first, I just need to build my basic material. So I press T, I'll search cloth. And the first one we're going to need is the ripped cloth albedo. So we're going to plug this into base color. Now next up will be the roughness. So press T and add some roughness. I'll search cloth instead of roughness because that'll be a bit more accurate. So plug that into the roughness. And now to actually build on the specular a little bit, let's go ahead and play with something. We're going to try and make this material be a little bit shiny, like almost play with the metallic and that sort of information a little bit. So to do that, I think I'm going to go ahead and bring in the cavity texture and then the gloss texture. I'm going to add these two together. So this is going to be my metallic, so it's going to build it up towards one. But I'm going to keep the specular pretty low here. So let's go ahead and use that gloss for the specular. So just play around with it so you can see, we kind of get a feeling of a metallic cloth. Let's bring the normal information as well, and that should be our last one. And let's look at how we can actually build this to have a bit more of a cloth feeling. So we've just set it up the way we would set up a normal material. We've not changed our shading model. We've not even decided or given it the ability to be like ribbed cloth. So if I just drag this in, if we compare the two that we have here, you can see this one feels normal and you can see these issues here because that's where the ribs are going to be. But you'll see this one has just a little bit more of a fuzzy cloth feeling to it compared to this one, right? Because we don't have a material set up for it yet. So in order to fix these two issues, let's go ahead and take a look at how we do that. So first of all, let's go ahead and add the ribs. So in order to do that, I need to change the masking mode. Now, I'm going to be showing, essentially, transparency in this material, but we don't want it to be translucent. We don't need that sort of nuance of maybe a little bit more see-through, a little bit less see-through. We just want to say whether something's visible or not. So in order to do that, I'm going to change the blend mode to masked. Now, you'll notice that the opacity mask node here has become available to us. And if we look at this albedo texture, you'll notice that it's got alpha or transparency information there, and that's coming in the alpha channel. So in order to use that individually, I'm just going to drag out of the alpha channel here and plug that into opacity mask. And you can see here, now we see through the material in the areas that our texture's telling it to be able to be see-through. Okay, so we fixed that issue, but we've still not fixed the cloth issue. And also, if you see, I can see through this material onto the other side, whereas on my material here, I can't see through it. So that's another thing that we'll have to fix. So let's fix the being able to see through it. Let's go ahead and take two-sided. So I'm just going to click empty space or the main node, which will allow us to see the material as a whole and change this to two-sided. So you'll see now that my material will be two-sided and I can see through the other side. And last but not least, I want to change this to be a cloth material so that we take advantage of the shading model. So in order to do that, I'm going to once again, click an empty space and I'm going to change the shading model here to cloth. Now you'll notice that that's given us another two values here, which we spoke about at the beginning of this lesson, which is the first color and the cloth. Now to keep things simple, you'll see, you can see that, you know, everything's been sort of whited out by the cloth shader. To just keep everything nice and simple, I'm just going to grab the color information here and plug it into first color. And since we don't want this to be crazy fuzzy, let's blow ahead and plug first color in. Sorry, base color into cloth as well. So really basic setup, keep it nice and simple. But as I apply this, you'll see that now we get that sort of clothy feel to it and the see-through nature of it as well. Okay, so that's how to create a quick cloth material inside Unreal Engine 5.",
