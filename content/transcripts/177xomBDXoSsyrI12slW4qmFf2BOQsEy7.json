  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at a more complicated layered system using the material function setup. And I'll walk you through what I created so you can have a better understanding of the possibilities using this old school method. So let's get started. In here, I have a more complicated material method here using material functions. Let's actually take a look at it up close. Now we did a simple kind of layout here where we have moss and then we have wood and we layered it in such a way so that is pretty straight up on how to get these two work together, stacking them in such a way so that we're using material functions in a parent material to be able to have them on top of each other. So let's go and look at the snow one up close. This is one that I created for Disney when it came to working with their scene. They created a VR experience called Myth VR. It's based on the Frozen universe. So I used this example to kind of show them how they can create some layered materials if they needed it. So if we go ahead and go ahead and click on the parent material here, just go and pull this over and we're going to take a look at this up close. Now you'll notice immediately what I have here in this parent material. We're using a make material attributes and we're prompting Unreal to say, hey, use material attributes that I've made. And in here we have some pretty simple function here. We have a couple of normals for blending. We're using a blended angle corrected normals for a little bit more believability and accuracy with those guys coming into each other. So they don't kind of crash into each other. We have a simple rock set up here with some UV control and we have some basic roughness. Now this is where things get a little bit deeper and actually allow you to add a bit more complexity. Let's look at the MF snow cover that I created. So let's double click on this. So up close automatically we can see in here things get a little bit more complicated. But let me show you what I mean. So again, we're in this material function that was made just like we did previously in this material function. We're also making sure that is exposed to library. We are creating a make attributes like we did before in the parent material. Now we just have some simple placeholders here are the initial look we want. You'll notice here I do have some notes in here for each one of these so you know what they do. This is used as a bridge to create a new functions and items to layer, especially in this case. So we're using this particular one as the base material. Know this material function losses to have a base material set up down below. You'll see here we have this node will help create a displacement over a surface. Now this was a little bit older material when displacement was a little bit easier to get to. So we can actually reinstate that functionality and we do have that for Nanite objects. It's built within the Nanite properties of the model details. But you can see there was a place where I did punch these in here so we could have more of that in here. You'll see we have a normal control here with a clamp here keeping things within a range. And then we're using a Lerp used to help determine whether we want the object to use the base material or be covered in snow. So we have that option and then we're using NPCs. Now you remember this from other your other classes. NPCs in material parameter collection. In this material parameter collection, we can choose snow color or snow amount in this particular case, initially choosing what that NPC is going to be once you drag it in. All right, cool. So from there we use the multiply and then we punch these in right into a height Lerp. So if we needed to increase the height of the snow color, it work best this way. Now you do want to be able to control some of your base height information. You'll notice I'm using this as a scalar. Here's an input and you've got to be careful for banding that may occur based on acute angles. You just got to be careful with that. Now I do go over that in a composition class a little bit. How you correct that in the height. We don't go over it in this particular class, but this definitely something you need to look out for because banding can occur on when things are a bit less flat and more round or more thick in shape. So just keep those things in mind. We have an inverted minus here in case you just wanted to flip the normals in the snow. That gives you the ability to do so and at least gives you the opportunity to be able to control some of that with the height. And we also have a matte material blend separate normal color clamp. And here we have base material, top material and so forth. All these are kind of in here. Now one I want to mention out is brought in from a matte layer function. I created the MFL material layer function snow function here and I went in here and we've double click. You can see that I built another system in here and this is where the complexity can happens in here. I have an absolute world position and a snow tiling control and I can choose how much snow tiling I want. This is the banding I was talking about. You'll see that on screen there. There's a divide is a bump offset all set up in here and you'll see also our normals and our input here tiling. Now if you wanted to redirect nodes, you can totally do that. I just kind of kept it so that I had make it a little bit easier with my notes. You can see what is doing what. So I made sure that I isolated these and you can see here this one helps create an effect. So when the rock moves, the snow shifts. So we're keeping that world alignment in there. This one right here is just a subsurface effect that we're plugging in to a secondary subsurface control and then we can control the color from here if we wanted to. We can make that blue ish if we wanted to a bit more. That is up to us. And then again, I am breaking down the notes in here. So things are a little bit easier and you can see where the direction things are going. Now you'll notice we have two outputs. We have an output here for our H output like height and then we also have a regular output results here and you can see that if we go back to we were you'll see there's a snow tiling. If I wanted to change it, I can change it within this function and I can also do it here. So telling once not telling two and I can choose what I want for that. All right. And all these will go to the corresponding you'll see the high output will go to the height texture. The end result of that snow function will be our top material because we know that's our top material. And then finally we go to the results output here. So you can see this one takes a little bit longer to make just because of this snow cover which has a lot going on. But again, I left it kind of a little bit of a noodle fest just so that I can keep my notes here a little bit. So you can see where the directories are going where everything's going in place. Let's open this up a little bit here should take there you go. And keeping keeping in mind where things are clamped and where things final destinations are at. So cool. Awesome. Well that's it with this one in the next video we're going to go and take a brief look at the mega scans way to do things and then in the video following we're going to go ahead and look at the new way to be able to create layer materials and I think you're going to like it. That's it.",
