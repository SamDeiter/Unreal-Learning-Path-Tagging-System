  "text": " Exporting and importing assets within the FBX pipeline in the engine can be a simple task with just the right settings. So the settings we're looking for in your Maya exporting is when after you've selected the FBX format, you want to make sure there are certain things that are checked on. In this case, if you know the smooth mesh is disabled and the smoothing groups are enabled. Now, if you have an animation to include, you want to go ahead and checkmark that there. Do not use the bake animation. That is when you're going to use the Alembic format within Maya to do that. Now on 3ds Max exporting, it's basically the same. So we don't need to go over those settings. Now, if you are interested in blender exporting, one, there is a Synthue plugin that is available through that YouTube and a link that is attached to that that goes over about installing and using that. Again, we won't be covering that today because that is outside the scope of today's purpose. Now we do export from blender and we're going to show you that it's the export FBX and you're going to have to fix the transforms. Now, there's also this thing called add leaf bones. You want to make sure that is checked off as unreal will see that as separate elements. So you actually wind up bringing in multiple characters and that's not what you're going to want. Now, smoothie groups doesn't exist like it does in other DCC programs. So you're going to make sure you have the auto smooth edge split and apply modifiers checked before exporting from blender as well as unchecked baked animation.",
