  "text": " Now that we're familiar with placing actors and navigating Unreal Engine, let's talk about working with materials and how we actually get some desired results from Unreal Engine. So the topics we'll cover here are the real-time material concepts, we'll talk about what PBR is and we'll also talk about parent materials and also material instances. So parent materials being the primary PBR inputs, the node settings and exposing the different parameters and then with material instances, it will talk about almost being a childhood version of this parent material which is a more simplified interface and we can create multiple versions of lighter, in this instance, more optimized materials based on that parent. Real-time material concepts, essentially starting off as what is a material? It is essentially an asset applied to a mesh to control its visual look. In its simplest form, think of it as paint with various properties such as color and finish. So if we see on the right hand side here, we'll see our paint brush and our bucket and tin, should we call it, and we'll be able to paint a certain surface and let's say we decide that this surface is glass. Now the eye looks at the glass and glass has reflective properties and it reflects a lot of light as well. So you'll see the surface next to it bounces off that light and it creates some reflection and inside of Unreal Engine, we define these properties of what we want glass to look like. Whereas when we have chalk, if we set certain parameters on the material to say we want this to be chalk, it disperses the light, it's much more of a matte material, there's not as much bounce going off the light and especially in one direction. So there's a clear difference between how we want glass to look and how we want chalk to look and we can define that all within Unreal Engine. So material defines how the light interacts with the surface it is applied to essentially. And then talking about PBR, PBR is a unified lighting and shading system. So it's a better approximation of light and materials for physical interaction. So it's very intuitive and consistent, you get specific results from using PBR, it's physically accurate and uses real-world physical measurements. So PBR is a combination of you creating the materials, setting up the lighting how you want it to be set up and also the exposure used within the scenes which is controlled through the post-process. Looking at the material editor as an overview, you'll see a whole bunch of nodes here connected into this master section here. So we can set up various parameters, maybe we want to change the texture coordinates of a texture and we want to offset the texture maybe and then maybe we want to add some contrast through a linear interpolate and we want to set a base color for certain samples and maybe we want to add a normal map to it. Again these materials can get super complex, we'll go over a basic material setup in a few slides here. But you can see there's a lot going on under the hood when we can set up materials, a lot of power and flexibility. You can also decide on certain material properties down on the bottom left heel. So what type of material domain is it, is it a surface, what type of blend mode do you want, do you want an opaque material, do you want a transparent material, what kind of material do you want to set up and then also what shading model do you want it to use and there's a lot more functionality as you scroll down the list in the material editor to get the desired results of what you want there. When we're talking about PBR, the primary inputs you're talking about are base color, metallic and roughness. So base color is some kind of flat color without specularity, it's a linear RGB which is a vector 3 and the values are between 0 and 1. The metallic input, so you'll see these base colors, you'll see metallic and you'll see roughness down here on the right hand side but the metallic is a grayscale value that will range from 0 to 1 and more often than not you really want the metallic value to be either 1 or 0. So when 1, its specular reflection is at 100% so it's the most metallic version, 0 is the least metallic version. And then roughness, grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1 and you can actually transition through this area on 1 in the roughness so you could have you know 0.35 for example but it ranges from smooth, mirror-like to a rougher more matted surface. So depending on the roughness of the material that you want you can manipulate that property to have the desired result that you want. We have a lot of different parameters available to us, we can right click anywhere in the material editor and again I'll be creating a basic material in a few slides here but you can right click anywhere in the material editor and create you know vector parameters, anything you need as well as change the parameter values on each of the nodes that you create. So say you created this vector 3 parameter here, you could select it and then set the colour, a lot of powerful functionality which I'll be going through in a second and so and then you can create a material instance that we spoke about at the start. So material instance is still a version of this master material but it's got certain parameters exposed like brightness for example which we can manipulate based on the parent properties but it's just a much more optimized unified way of working. So let's go into Unreal, let's create a basic material, let's show you the different options and then let's create a material instance for that as well. you",
