  "text": " Next up we're talking about bind widget, bind widget animations and synchronized properties. So these are all different functionalities that we can use to facilitate communicating from our blueprint down to our C++ and being able to do various things in C++ that we can kind of trust either ourselves at a later date or some other member of our team, possibly designers or more visually oriented people can utilize functionality that we've done in C++ without having to worry too much exactly about the way our implementation works. So first off, bind widgets. Bind widgets is a mesopet specifier that you can put on widget pointers in our user widget classes and it allows the designer to populate native C++ level members with a designer created widget. This kind of flies in the face of general Unreal development pipeline, a blueprint layer sitting on top of a C++ one. In this case we're essentially leaving a gap in the C++ layer for the blueprint layer to fill in for us. So let's talk through a practical example. Let's say that we've got a C++ base class off of a user widget with a text block member and the text block container is exactly what you'd think, a widget capable of rendering text in UMG, I've already mentioned that a little bit earlier in the session. If we flag this up with the bind widget specifier we're saying that to the compiler this particular widget is populated from the designer layer. We've kind of said that it will exist at some point but we don't actually need to initialize it ourselves in code. We would, like we would with something like an actor component or something like that, we're just going to say that we're going to work with this bit of information but it's actually going to get created later down the inheritance hierarchy by someone on top in the blueprint layer. This frees up any UI designers to implement the text blocks and change its visuals, its positions, its parenting. We're not baking in how this is childed, we're not baking anything by its hierarchy, we're just simply saying there will be a text widget with this name and we're going to do some things with it. Anything else that gets done with it that's kind of up to whoever is putting that into place. As engineers we're now kind of free to assume that this is now valid and we can carry on developing as we would otherwise. This is also kind of just as a flow optimization, it just kind of means that we can kind of offload some of that thinking about exactly how this stuff is going to be laid out to kind of further down the road. Again, whether that's us later to date or whether that's someone else on the team, it just means that we can kind of work with the bits that really matter and not get really really hung up on you know what is the exact hierarchical structure of all of these things. One question you might have is that if we're saying this thing exists, but how can we trust that it's going to exist? How can we trust that the designer is actually going to make the thing that we need them to make or ourselves at a later date, how are we going to trust ourselves? The reason this works is the blueprint will actually fail to compile if it's not compliant with the underlying native code. So bind widget essentially signals to the blueprint layer, hey I need a widget of this type with this specific name to work properly, so you need to add one. This kind of manifests itself in a compilation failure and there's also, I don't know what version of Unreal they actually introduced this, but I don't think this used to be the case, but when you have widgets that implement bind functionality such as our segmented bar widget, any bind widgets there's actually a separate window that highlights all of the kind of bindable bits of information and I'll show you, this is what the widget type is, this is what the widget is called and there's this kind of like little health check to tell you oh hey we've got a binding here. We'll get into actually, this is an example that we'll jump to later, but it's just kind of worth highlighting that as well as just a pure compilation failure. There's this kind of separate window that is going to highlight to you exactly what bindings it's looking for ahead of time and what those things are meant to be called and what type they're meant to be, so it's just a very very helpful little window. Yeah, so yeah the blueprint is going to fail to compile and we've got that bind window functionality. So we talked about bind widgets, synchronized properties is something else we're going to mention. This is a virtual function that we can override to develop smart responsive UI tools, so in many ways it kind of mirrors on construction or post edit property virtuals that we would see when we're working with actor classes, so if anyone is familiar with those things. It'll be called every time a property changes within a specified widget in both the designer and it can get called at runtime, not in exactly the same way it does in designer, so that can be a little bit confusing. It's not every time a single value changes, but it does have, when our widget at least gets constructed and needs to pass our information down to slate at runtime, that is when our synchronized properties get called, but anytime we're changing data inside our designer it will get recalled because our entire widget gets reconstructed. The kind of key point in here is it's not just runtime, it is also in design time, so we're able to respond to changes made in design at design time and give visual feedback. Obviously it's probably quite important to know whether or not we are currently working in a design time environment or runtime logic, so there is also an isDesignTime function that we can kind of use to branch to if we need to do particular design time behavior or ignore certain bits of behavior that we would only be able to trust because they're referencing things that we know will only exist at runtime or something like that. We've got this isDesignTime function to kind of let us know about that. It's worth noting that synchronized properties has quite a lot in common with another function called preconstruct, which we'll bring up again later, but preconstruct was a later introduction to UMG as part of UAV4's lifecycle and there are some relatively subtle differences between the two things, but the biggest one is that synchronized properties isn't exposed to blueprints so it's a C++ only function. Secondly, preconstruct is defined in user widgets, so preconstruct is a user widget downwards function that is exposed to blueprints, whereas synchronized properties is available to, is only in C++, but is available to anything you widget and downwards. Part of synchronized properties responsibility is not just to communicate information from blueprint down to your C++, but it's also to communicate information from the UMG down to the slate, so it's already being used for something something else as well, which is also worth mentioning that it's very important that when you're doing a synchronized property, when you're overriding your synchronized properties functionality that you do call your super function, because like I said, synchronized properties is also responsible for communicating information down from your UMG down to slate, so if that function isn't called, suddenly your slate widget isn't going to work properly, and you know, your slate widget is what you actually see on screen, what you actually click on, so that's quite important. But yeah, again, the discrepancies between preconstruct and synchronized properties, if you actually dig into the C++, you'll see that they're actually calling in quite similar ways at quite similar times, so you can kind of see they do perform a fair amount of similar functionality, they both have this kind of capability of both design and runtime implementation. So if we were to kind of look at a practical example, I've kind of already prefaced this a little bit by opening up that widget before, but this is how we might use a bind widget in combination with synchronized properties to kind of make a setup that we're able to do the C++ code and kind of know how it's going to work, but we actually don't need to worry about the like real detail about where are these widgets going to go, how are they going to be laid out with each other, how are they going to be coloured, it's not our responsibility, the only bit that we care about is we just need widget x and we're going to do y thing with it, everything else is kind of up to the designer. So what we've got here is a kind of widget that is meant to represent a kind of a health bar, and the kind of key elements here is, well I can actually just jump to the C++ function rather than using the slide presentation here, so if I just jump to our 1.5 section, again, if you have this project downloaded all of this code will be available to you, so you can look at this C++ code at your own leisure. So we've got this relatively simple segmented bar widget, you can see this is a C++ class that inherits from user widget, we've got our synchronized properties function which we've already mentioned, we've got a construct function, we don't need to worry too much about that, but we've also got our various variables and importantly here we've got a T-object pointer, we talked about this in maybe our first session, maybe our second, I'm pretty sure it was our first, a T-object pointer basically being the kind of more modern version of just a kind of raw pointer, so this could just as easily look like this, but T-object pointer has certain editor time kind of advantages over, you can spend your own time looking into that if you're not kind of familiar with that. Either way we were saying there's a kind of a widget of type horizontal box and it's called HB segments, we've marked this up as a bind widget, so essentially say we're going to act as though this widget exists but the burden is kind of on the designer or whoever is making the blueprint that implements this widget to actually make sure that this gets created. Then we've got just some additional bits of information, we've got like a segment class, we've got the number of segments we want, we've got some padding between those segments, we'll also come to this in a little bit but we've also got a bindable widget animation. So if we go into our C++ we can see that kind of most of the heavy lifting here is being done inside our synchronized properties, as you can see first and foremost we're calling our super function because we want our code to work, and then you can see we're doing this isDesignTime check, this isn't particularly important, I don't actually need to do this here because this functionality would be just as valid in runtime, I've kind of just put this here to show you us using it, to say that if we're not in design time then we don't want to do this, but actually in reality there's no reason why we wouldn't want to do that, I'm kind of just showing it off. But the kind of other important element here is that hypothetically there are scenarios where synchronized property could get called whilst our bind widgets are null, so it's quite important to do this null checking. If you're going to be relying, whilst we can trust that someone else does have to make this, if they try to compile or utilize this widget until that bind widget is actually properly set up, this is going to be null. So one of the other things we should be very careful about is when we're trying to use this functionality, when we're trying to use bind widgets, we should be checking for whether or not these things are null first to make sure we're not actually just getting null reference exceptions and things like that, and then we just get hard crashes. So the logic here is relatively simple, we've got this horizontal box, we're calling clear children, this is a kind of general function you can call on most panel type widgets and it just essentially says remove every element that's currently inside this panel and kind of discard them, and then we're just doing a for loop for our segment count which by default is 10, so from 0 to 10, and for everything we're using this create widget, we've already talked about this, and again one of the viable things to pass in as an owner of a widget is another widget and we are inside a widget so this is fine, and then we're just passing in this segment widget class, again we've checked up here whether or not that's null, so we wouldn't even get here if it wasn't, if it was, sorry, null, and then last of all, now that this has been created, we're adding that created widget to our horizontal box, and typically this isn't a hard and fast rule, if you created your own panels you wouldn't have to do this, but there's this typical kind of thing that there's these add child to panel functions, and normally what they'll do is return a reference to the slot that now contains that child, and that lets you do things, kind of lay out data about that slot, and so in this context we're using that opportunity to get hold of the horizontal box slot that this new segment is now inside of, and we're setting our padding so this segment padding can come into play. I pressed F11 there accidentally and now it's trying to do a build, sorry about that, yeah, and you can see we're just relying on our padding. Padding is basically an amount, its name kind of does what it says on the tin, but padding is basically the amount that a widget kind of sets itself away from other widgets. So the C++ there is relatively simple, let's see if there's anything else I kind of want to mention there. Well I guess we'll go ahead to the bind widget animations first and then we'll kind of actually just demonstrate that working. So next up we have the bind widget animations, we've kind of already prefaced this a little bit, this essentially does exactly the same thing that you would expect, it's a bind widgets, but it's specifically for animations, so this essentially allows us to specify an animation, say you know I'm going to rely on this animation existing but it's not my responsibility to make that animation, either myself at a later date or someone, whoever is doing the blueprint that implements this C++ class, is the person who has to make the animation and that animation just needs to have a particular name. No matter what kind of animation it is, all animations are UWidget animations, so whereas with bind widgets you kind of have to make sure that the name is right and the type is right with widget animations, they're all widget animations, so the only thing you actually need to worry about is that the animation name is correct. And yeah the other kind of thing is specifically for bind widget animations they need to be marked as transient, you'll get complaints if you don't do that, so just a little thing to kind of bear in mind there. And yeah I think that's kind of everything we're talking about here for the bindables, let's just quickly demonstrate this working. So as I said, I've made a widget that inherits from our segmented bar widget, you know this could be a health bar, this could be an XP bar, this could be mana, whatever you like, but this is kind of just to demonstrate that functionality. You can see we've got our bind widgets all kind of set up, you can look at my hierarchy, it's relatively simple really. I can add obviously as much as I like, I can wrap this horizontal box inside a border if I like, I can and I'll make that border just like a dark red so that it's kind of clearer, and I could add, I don't know, I could wrap that inside another horizontal box and I could say put a text block next to it and just say health, if I'm going to spell it right, and then I can make this fill up the rest of the space. So you can see that clearly there's no complaints here right, even though there's a huge difference between my horizontal box being the only widget in the widget and being inside a border which is inside a horizontal box, but clearly the only thing that the C++ cares about is that there is a widget with this name, that it is a horizontal box, and we already kind of showed some of the variables that are available, but we've got the segment count and you can just see as I'm changing that, this is called every time I'm changing this, our synchronize properties function is getting called again and so we can kind of respond. Obviously there's currently no rule saying that I need to not extend outside the bounds of my widget, if I did want to very very quickly do that I could actually specify some clip bounds, so I could just go to my horizontal box and just do clip, for some reason the C button on my keyboard is temporarily not working, if I specify some clip bounds then we would actually get slightly more sane looking behaviour, but that wouldn't actually reduce the number of... we still actually have 87 segments here, you just can't see them, but that is a way that we kind of solve that problem. So again as you can see it doesn't care about the rest of the hierarchy, it doesn't care what else is going on in this widget, it just cares that there's a widget called segments, and again just to demonstrate what would actually be happening if we didn't have this set up correctly, even something as minor as a change to say hey HB segments 2, and then I go to compile, you can see it's no longer filling with data properly and we're going to get a complaint that you know there's this data that should be bound but it's not bound, we can go to our bind widget and say hey I'm looking for a widget called HB segments, but it's not found, so you know the spelling is very very important here. And the same thing applies to our animations, whereas you know again we... if I were to make... let's just temporarily call that HB segments E, and if I make a vertical box and call that HB segments, or I don't know why it doesn't... oh it's probably not letting me do that. Essentially it's looking specifically for a horizontal box called HB segments, even if there's another widget with the same name but it's a different type, that's not going to be suitable either is all I'm trying to say with this. But that same burden of type isn't there for our widget animations because all widget animations are widget animations. So all you need to do there is make sure that the animation has the right name, regardless of what the animation is doing, you could do a million things, you could do one thing, you could do no things, there just needs to be an animation with that name. In this context I've just made an appear animation which is just going to fade our widget in using our render opacity from zero to one. I'm not actually using this anywhere I don't think, or am I? If I go to our construct... oh I am actually playing it when we play construct, well done me. So yeah you can see I'm utilizing in C++ there, but we've got the same problem here, so if I go to our animations thing and I just change this to anim appear and I just do a little typo and I forget the R, suddenly we're going to get complaints and you know it's going to say that this doesn't work, we're expecting an animation called anim appear, animapia doesn't count. So names really matter here. And again you can see it's very easy to forget that you're still in animation mode, so I'm clearly still got that animation selected, just need to select off that.",
