  "text": " Let's jump into Path Tracer now and today we'll cover what Path Tracer is and what situations we might use it. We'll talk about how to set it up, some new materials and features, referencing the depth of field, reducing artifacts, denoising, setting up materials, editing some specific Path Tracer settings and then talk about some skylights and then to close out some limitations again when using Path Tracer. So what is Path Tracer and why might we use it? Path Tracer uses the same ray tracing architectures of the ray tracing features such as the realtime ray tracing and GPU lightmass that we were referring to before, but it makes it ideal for ground truth comparisons and production based renders. So we might use this for archviz or film or any kind of TV customer. So we get the benefit of refractive glass, we've got the global illumination and reflections, the SSS, etc. So the Path Tracer only uses geometry and material present in the scene to render an unbiased result and it does not share the same ray tracing code that has been developed to work well for realtime rendering. So just a quick note that if ray tracing is kept on, switching between Path Tracer view mode and lit mode, ray trace materials will not view the same. And then to enable this in the project settings, again we open up our project settings in the rendering section, we've got the hardware ray tracing, we've got support hardware ray tracing, path tracing, platforms, which is the windows, targeted RHI's, defaulted to DX12 there, and then in the engine we want to go to rendering, optimizations and enable support compute skin cache. So one active change, your lighting mode to Path Tracer. So some cool new materials and features that come with Path Tracer, so eye shading is now supported, we've also got hair supported, and then glass absorption which is the absorbent distance, which is a scalar parameter inside of your material. So the lower the number, the less absorption and the higher the number, the more light that passes through it. And we also have in Unreal Engine 5 the implementation of energy conservation, is used to reduce the energy loss in specular lobe of metals and glass materials, you can turn on energy conservation from the project settings under engine rendering in the materials section. And as we were discussing in the ray tracing section, you can now use a quality switch replace for Path Tracer as well. So if you've used Path Tracer before, you'll know that there was an issue with the translucency and depth of field, the problem was the translucent material wasn't rendered to the depth buffer, so basically it wasn't getting an accurate depth of field. So now in the Path Tracer settings you can remedy that with a tick box, it's always a good tick box, but now you can reference depth of field with this nice little tick box here, and that should sort out any kind of the major issues with translucency and depth of field. We also want to reduce artifacts, so the Path Tracer simulates light by randomly tracing rays according to a material's properties. When bright areas of the scene have a low probability of being discovered, the resulting samples can become excessively bright, creating specks of light or little fireflies as you can see in this GIF here, it appears and disappears within the frame. So Path Tracing attempts to minimise the most common sources of these effects can still occur in some scenarios, so it's good to watch out for that. And then also when the Path Trace result is combined with Bloom post-processing passes, the resulting pixels can be particularly noticeable because of how they appear and disappear or become brighter or dimmer. So post-processing settings will be key here to save this, and in the Max Exposure Path, which is under the Path Tracing settings of the post-process, you can control the maximum exposure using the rendered Path Trace scene. So adjust that exposure to be a few steps higher than the current scene exposure and set that by the post-process Max EV100, which is found in the Lens Exposure section of your viewport. So that will reduce the chance of fireflies occurring, and here we are a bit higher, but still get some great results. Moving next at denoising with Path Tracing. So even with higher sample counts, the Path Tracer will always have a bit of residual noise in the rendered frame as we saw before. So the denoising option in the post-process volume makes use of Intel's Open Image Denoise library to remove noise from the last sample. So just a quick note here that the denoiser runs on the CPU and is not currently designed for interactive denoising, but rather to help improve the quality of the long-running frames, it does not currently guarantee temporal consistency and relatively high samples per pixel are required for a stable output. So temporal stability can also be improved by increasing the temporal sample count in the anti-aliasing settings in the movie render queue, which you can see here. So note that the animated items may still have flickering shadows, setting spatial sample count and temporal to 10 can help. Path Tracer is still very much evolving, so it's always good to check out the documentation links that we post at the end of each section just to see what the latest features are. And then also the more samples with denoiser on the better results for the final renders using the movie render queue. The default in PPV is 16384. The filter width acts as an anti-aliasing filter, which is a large blurry anti-aliasing results and also emissive materials allow for the HDRI backdrops to be used to give off light or other materials with emissive properties. So how do we set up our materials to work well with Path Tracer? So with glass, there are two methods of rendering glass with specified thickness in the Path Tracer. You can use a few values which are physically accurate, look based on the physical properties of the surface, and then also use additional properties like a Fresnel for more control over the art direction. It's a little bit less accurate, but it allows for the reflection fall off control. So to create physically accurate glass, just a few sample values are required with Path Tracer. So you can see a couple of examples here where we go for something a bit more accurate with that Fresnel in there, and then accurate with added values plugged in on this next example, and then also just something more accurate with more basic features. So it depends on what look you're going for. Again, it's the kind of more art directed approach depends on what you're looking for. But here are a few examples to get you on your way with Path Tracer. If you want a thin glass shader, the thin translucency shading model is useful for achieving physically accurate results with appropriately colored translucent shadowing for thick glass with approximate caustics. So we can create a translucent material. We can change the shading model up here to the thin translucent. So you can see the shading model is thin translucent. To get these properties, you can just click on this material box here, and that will give you all the properties. You want to change the lighting mode to the surface forward shading, and then also add a thin translucent material output node to add color to that as well. If we want to add some roughness to our materials in Path Tracer, we can set some transparency So the Path Tracer is unique in that it allows for rendering of rough transmission in addition to rough reflection. So in the case of the Path Tracer, the shader parameters are coupled together. So the roughness value of the glass material varies to demonstrate the approximate caustics, roughness of the reflection, and the effect that it has on the translucent shadow being cast. So just a quick note here, in that in all materials of the translucent objects, contact shadows can be enabled. If we want to dial in any of the settings of Path Tracer, we can use some approximate caustics here. So the Path Tracer uses approximate caustic paths to help reduce noise, especially in the case where glass or metal surface has lower roughness values. So for these types of materials, the reflective caustics can produce various patterns and help take up in practical amount of time or samples to converge for a noise free image. So because caustics generally take a long time to converge to a noise free result, the Path Tracer reduces image noise by approximating the caustics that would be present in the image using the console command, which is the approximate caustics one. So this variable is enabled by default and you can try toggling between zero and one for your desired result there. And then another element to consider is the difference between refractive caustics and approximate caustics. So by using the denoiser, it's possible to preview how the caustics would appear, given enough time to converge. So whereas the approximate caustics gives a production ready image in much shorter time, you can toggle this CVAR on and off depending on if you want the approximate caustics enabled or if you prefer the disabled look, each will give its own output. And then a few more CVARs that are helpful when editing is the visible lights CVAR, which makes all lights visible to the camera rays. And this is disabled by default to match the raster based modes of the engine, but it can be useful to understand how lights are modeled to spot cases where lights are overlapping. We've also got the progress display, which has a small progress bar of the view that displays progress towards the configured sample per pixel. And then we've got the progress bar that will automatically be hidden when accumulation is complete. So it doesn't affect renders with the movie render queue, and it's safe to have on for your debugging, it's not going to impact the final output. We've also got the denoiser that we spoke about before, and it can be used to quickly toggle the denoiser on and off. We've also got the show flag of path tracing, so making sure that you can toggle setting to one will allow you to use path tracer directly, including at runtime, and then zero will set it off. Setting it to two by default removes any specific overrides from this flag. And then you've also got the sampler tag type, which is changing the sample to allow you to tweak sampling process to accommodate for speed or quality. And zero is the default here. And one can improve sample results, but may take longer and two can greatly increase sampling speed. But of course, it comes at the cost of accuracy there. And to close out looking at the skylight properties. The skylight capture is only visible when real time capture is enabled. So we can improve the render quality by increasing the resolution of the skylight capture to be higher than is used for real time capture. And then also when not using real time capture mode, a skybox or sphere is expected to have a sky representation. So its material must have the is sky, which you can see in the material properties there, enabled in the material settings. Otherwise, its illumination will be double counted against the skylighting. It's likely to produce unnecessary noise that won't improve what you're looking for. So skybox, the sphere shape should also not cast any shadows, because that can include contributions from the skylight and the directional light. And some limitations of path tracer. So these are currently either not supported or partially supported. However, that being said, we've got some documentation in a second, and it's worth always checking the documentation for the latest features because they may be changing and shifting. But currently as it stands, we've got sky atmosphere and volumetric clouds that aren't supported yet. We've got the sky atmosphere, which is partially supported, but requires a skylight, which has real time capture enabled, as we just mentioned. Volumetric clouds are partially, but also required in the real time capture enabled. We've got height fog and volumetric fog, which isn't supported with path tracer. However, this is on the road map, so may be available at the time of your viewing. Spline meshes are not supported nor Cascade particles, which are the legacy because Niagara is the new system there. Light functions aren't supported. Single water shaders are not supported. Motion blur is only supported via movie render queue, which is partially supported. Decal's aren't and neither is Nanite. So again, worth checking in to see what path tracer is and isn't supporting at the time of you using it. So as promised, we've got the documentation link here, path tracer in Unreal Engine, the slides were created by Sean Spitzer, and hopefully that takes you on your journey of uncovering path tracer and what functions and features it can provide you in your projects. So thank you for your time today. On today's course, we've covered a lot of ground in terms of ray tracing and path tracer, lots of different settings and CVAs you can use to really dial in your projects, insetted output. Again, it's going to depend on whether it's real time or final pixel. What it is that you're trying to achieve will always come with that trade off between performance and quality, but hopefully we presented you with a lot of options there to help you on your specific projects. So thank you very much again for your time and we'll see you on the next course.",
