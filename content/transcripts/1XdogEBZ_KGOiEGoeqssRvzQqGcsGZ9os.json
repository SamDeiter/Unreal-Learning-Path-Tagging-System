  "text": " So today we're going to take several animation sequences that exist with Unreal and create our own zombie walk. The first thing we'll have to do though is to create one simple animation and then build upon that, blending multiple animations using the blend nodes to create our animation. So first we're going to go over a few of the blend nodes that we have at our disposal. One of them is the apply additive, the blend and the blend by channel. Now when we get into Unreal, we open our project, we'll be able to go into these a little bit further. But these explanations are basically stating that we can connect our various animations to the A and B and then by adjusting the alpha, we can decide what we want or control what amount of the blend that we wish. So for example, you could have an animation that was just a simple walk and another one that was a walk with a little bit different type of animation, let's say B, and you could adjust the alpha to include a little bit more of the B animation to kind of control it or apply an additive to that animation. So that's what we're going to be working with today. So let's go ahead and create a project so that we can actually go through this and begin to create our first animation. All right, so first things first, let's create that project. So in here in the marketplace, or rather in our library, we have the engine version available. Today I'm going to be using 5.3.2. And once we hit launch, it takes a few seconds for it to load and compile. We're going to go ahead and select the games templates. You can use any of these templates as mentioned many times before, but we're going to use the games and we're going to look for the third person. Then over here, you'll see starter content and ray tracing, which you can leave all these on as it is by default. We don't need starter content, nor do we need ray tracing for this project. And I'm going to create a class. We can call it whatever you want. You can call it AnomBPs5.3, which I'd use for the engine version that I am creating during wherever you're going to store it and hit create. Now again, you're going to have the project splash screen come up. It'll take it a few seconds for it to load and compile. Once it's done that, we can go ahead and get started. Few seconds. There we go. We can bring this on up. Now as you saw in our slides, we'll be able to go over that here in a sec. We're going to be opening up the BP Manny. We're going to disconnect the output pose, then compile and save. So this is what it should look like, the original BP or blueprint. All right. Let's go ahead and open that up. Right here, located under the animations under mannequins. This is where our blueprints exist. Now you'll notice there are two blueprints. There's the Quinn and the regular Manny. If you double click on this, you'll be able to see it. Looks like such. You'll notice there's not a lot going on there. It's just an event graph, no animation blueprint. The reason for this, as this states, this is a child animation of the main blueprint. So all it does is that everything that you do in the Manny blueprint will affect the Quinn because they do share the same skeleton. This works across everything within Unreal. Anything that's shared will do that. So just keep that in mind. So we'll go ahead and double click ABP Manny. We'll dock that back right here. And you'll see the event graph. Now we will be getting into this much later, but right now we want to pop into the animation graph and look at what we got here. So what we see is a main state, some other things going on, a control rig, all this is all working together to create our final outpost. Now without dissecting this particular one, we're going to disconnect this and create our animation. I'm going to go ahead and close that to give us some more landscape. But if you zoom in, you'll see he's kind of breathing, right? A little bit of change going on. So this is what we're seeing through the output post. Whatever has been programmed here is what we're going to see. So I'm going to go ahead and disconnect this and drag this on down here just so we can see our grid. And you'll notice it does look like a lot of the others, like materials and blueprints. This is what the grids look like. So that means that any time you right click, you'll get a selection of various types of nodes that you wish to use. If you hit compile up here and save, you'll notice it pops back to an A pose because, well, we're not telling them to do anything. All right, so we're going to build the first part of our animation, but we'll need some animation sequences that already exist with Unreal. So I'm going to go ahead and grab those real quickly. So let's look for the MM run forward. Look here, we're going to drag that in, not the T pose, run forward. There we go. Got the run forward. Then we're also the walk forward. So you just kind of there, there it is right there. I love how it doesn't want to select it. There you go. There's the walk forward and the walk in place. Let's try and get that again. Drag that in. And then the fall loop is the next one that we want to grab, which is right there. And that's all four of them for now. Now, before we go any further, I want to show you something else that we're going to want to do with the settings. So come over here to details, highlight all of these, make sure they're all highlighted. We want to look for the loop animation. That's going to make things a little easier for us later on. Keep everything consistent. And when we edit, it'll help us a lot more. So once you have that, got all those selected, and you are able to change it to loop animation. You can check each one you want to. You'll see that the loop animation is good. All right, so we are good for there. I am going to move these a little bit more out of place so that we can have a little bit more room to work with. And now we want to begin to work with some of our blends. So now if we go back to our PowerPoint, we will see these three here. You have the apply additive, the blend and blend by channel. And we're going to be working with the blend more than the other two for now simply because we just need a simple animation. But each one of these are based on an alpha. So all that means is when you plug things into the A or B, or actually A and B, that it'll blend based on this alpha. So think of it as just how you're going to blend it as a channel. So if you do 0.5, that means it's going to be equal, shared between. If you have one, it's only going to be one that's shared. It's typically the A will be the one that gets the most. So just think of that. It's just kind of like a pipe flow of energy flowing through it or water flowing through it. So as we adjust this, if we were to go down to 0.2, that means we get a little bit more B than we would have A. And so it kind of works in that way. And you'll see that as we work within the engine. So let's go ahead and pop in there. We've already disconnected. We're ready to go. So let's go ahead and do this. So let's go ahead and right click and type in blend. Now you will notice when we go all the way up here, we have quite a few of these things. It's called blend poses by going and collapse that that's going to make it a little easier to see some of these blends that we're going to be working with today. All right. We're going to select blend, just a simple blend. And what we're going to do is we're going to connect a couple of these and then we're going to do it to the result. And then we're going to record. So let's go ahead and grab our M.M. walk in place. That's down here. Drag that on up here. Connect the little guy to the little guy. Zoom in here for you to see. You have that. And then the next one is the M.M. walk forward. Don't worry, we'll get to these other ones later. We're just building our simple animation right now to get it started. OK. And right now, if we were to hit compile and save, nothing's going to happen because we have to hook this up to the output pose. Let's go ahead and grab that. Connect that right in there. You get that little check mark. Now it won't do anything to hit compile, save. OK. So now we have a kind of a staggered different walk in place. A little bit of a walk forward. Now all we're doing is we're taking the knowledge of what those animations did as each other. So when we blend them together, we know certain things are going to happen, like the arm is going to move a certain way. So that's basically what we're doing. OK. So this is the first part of our setup. Now what we need to do now is we need to record this animation to use later. The reason this is called optimization. So we wouldn't want to have this setup all the time. In order to build our zombie walk, we're going to optimize by creating this recording this animation and then utilizing that to build upon even more. So you may be doing this, for example, you have the teams out doing some mocap and they're going to do something really cool. But hey, the art directors get impatient. They want to see it. This would be the perfect example of when you would want to create something really quick on the fly. And you'll see it's quite fast when you do this more and more. So now to record, we need to do one thing. Come over here to this little record button and click record. Now it's going to ask where you wish to save it. And I'm going to go here to the content. I'm going to right click and type new folder. You don't have to do this. I just like doing this to keep my animations together in a nice little folder and we'll leave the animation frames per second and everything else by default. But you can actually name this. So I am going to name this. So it makes it a lot easier and save some time. I'm going to type in creep and it's called creep walk and then underscore and I'm that just lets us know that it's an animation. And I'll hit OK. I'm going to go to about 15 seconds. You can see it really closely here as it's going. We'll say about 15, you do 10 or 15 arbitrary numbers. Now hit stop. Now down here you'll notice you have a creep up animation has been created. And if you open that when that comes up, no problem. If it disappears, don't worry. It's in this list right here. You can just actually see it right there so you could double click to see it. Now as you see going through, there's a little slight little hitch. Don't worry. That can be fixed later and sequencer or we can do anyplace else to to clean up that animation. But it's not a big deal. Again, we're just kind of working with this. Now what I want to do is I do want to hit stop and I want to put it to about, let's say again arbitrary number, let's say about 120 or so. I want to delete everything beyond this point. All I would do is right click here and I would remove frame 141 to 313. And you can play around with this and readjust the numbers. But we're just going to go ahead and remove the from 141 to 313. And that's fine. We'll just leave it there for now. You can hit play and test it. Everything looks good. You can hit save and it looks good. And close that out and to test it. All I want to do is I want to go ahead and just disconnect all this here. We no longer need it. So to do that, you hit the alt and left mouse button and it will remove all that. It compile. Nothing's there. So I'm going to go ahead and grab my creep animation, which was at the bottom. If you don't see it again, you can just type in creep. Go ahead and see it. There it is right there. I let it and drag it on in. Now let's test it and see if it works when we connect this here. We hit that, hit compile and save. And there you go. You've got your first simple animation all based off from what we saw there. So I'm going to go ahead and disconnect that now. And we'll start with the next part.",
