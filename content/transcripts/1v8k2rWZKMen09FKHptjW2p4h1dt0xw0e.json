  "text": " So the first thing we want to do, as we saw in the diagrams that we were going through before is that we want to create a new blueprint class. So the way I do this more often than not is to right click on the content folder, go to new folder, and I'm going to type this blueprints. I generally like to create a new folder for blueprints and then what I'll even probably do is create a new folder here called maybe let's call it interactions. The name and convention is completely up to you what you want to use, but you can imagine if we're doing multiple blueprints here and we've got different types of blueprints, maybe there's a player blueprint, maybe there's something that's not an interaction, maybe it's a pickup blueprint for example, it's just good to start organizing your blueprints and getting used to the flow. So inside of the interactions folder, I'm going to right click and select blueprint class and we're going to find this pick parent class box that we saw in the PowerPoint previously. Now because we're creating a door, we don't need any of this other functionality. Blueprint actor is an object that can be placed or spawned in the world and because we're placing the door in the world, it makes sense to pick actor here. So I'm just going to select actor and it's going to create a new blueprint down here and I'm going to call this BP underscore and BP is essentially just blueprint underscore and I'm going to call this door. So BP door and then hit enter. Now getting used to good naming conventions again will help your journey in blueprints and keep organization nice and clean. In this example, we're going to go for BP underscore which is a good naming convention to take forward using blueprints but again go ahead and use whatever naming conventions that you'd prefer to use. I'm going to double click this blueprint and it's going to open the blueprint editor. I'm just going to dock this blueprint window at the top of my screen. I'm just going to go to file, save all and okay, we're in a good place. So the first thing we want to do is add our door frame to this blueprint class. So again, we're going to use this components window that's on the left hand side here which we spoke about before saying that we'll get a visual representation of all our blueprint components. One thing I always keep forgetting about Unreal Engine 5, that's what you used to have to do in Unreal Engine 4 but anywhere in the editor now, we can just hit control and space bar which brings up the window. So this makes our lives much easier. So no matter which window you're in, you just want to hit control and space bar and we want to select the door frame. So as long as we have the door frame selected now, we can go to add and you'll see static mesh SM underscore door frame. Now if you can't see that door frame, it's likely that you didn't select it in your quick draw. So just make sure you have that selected and then we'll go to add and we'll go to static mesh. So if we just zoom out here, the navigation that I'm using for zooming by the way is left mouse button will pan me around and right mouse button will rotate the camera. Both can go up and down. So both left mouse button and right mouse button together will go up and down. So again, you can just get familiar with that interaction there. Just good practice every time I add a component, I'm just going to hit compile and we're going to hit save. Compile compiles our code. Now compile, even though we've not got any blueprint code per se, we added something to the blueprint which needs to be checked if it needs compiling. So we got a green tick, we're good and we forgot the save button. But I'm going to hit control and space bar again. I'm going to select the door, the exact same functionality now. So I'm going to go to add door. And because our world zero, our central point of this blueprint is in the middle and our door frame has a pivot that's in the middle and our door actually has a pivot that's on its left hand side here because it needs to rotate from that origin. We just need to make sure we move this across. Now if your door is snapping like this, you'll see there's some grid snapping and some rotation snapping. So I can either toggle the grid down to a lower number. So I'm just using my bracket keys on the keyboard or I can hit five units and see if that snaps. Okay, we're good there. So the door has been made to a unit snap of five and it looks like it's got a nice fit in all over. So again, I'm just going to compile and save and I'm going to get into the habit of doing that each time. Next thing we want to do, now we definitely want to go into the first person map. We want to hit control and space bar. I'm going to navigate up to my blueprints folder. I'm going to grab my blueprint and drag and drop it in the map and here we have our first blueprint in the game. If we hit play, we can see there's a door here. It's not got any functionality. We bang into the door. We can't go through the door yet, but we've created our first blueprint which we'll now add code to.",
