  "text": " So casting is probably a concept that you're already pretty familiar with, but as with things like the standard pointer library and just a lot of the standard template library, Unreal actually has its own implementations of these things which we encourage you to use. So let's just look into that a little bit. So first off we have object is a. Essentially this is what the function that you would call when you want to check purely whether a thing is another thing, whether a class is actually a child of this other type of class. Not when you need access to that class's information, but you just purely want to perform that check. The kind of step up from that is the cast template and type T. And this is when you would be both checking, it's like a dynamic cast, it's when you are both checking for whether or not this object matches that type, but also if it does you get back an instance, a copy of that variable with that type or a null pointer if it wasn't that type. So that's the kind of more complicated version. The templated form of cast does essentially perform is a under the hood, so again slightly less performant because there's a couple more steps. If you only need the binary check for whether or not this is a thing, you don't need access to its data, then it's preferable to use is a for slightly better performance. Cast-cast checks whether it is precisely this type, not whether it is a child of this type, but whether the types match exactly. And last of all we have cast-checked. This is essentially a slightly more performant version of cast where if it fails that cast then you would get a crash, but it performs an is a at editor time, at development time, but actually in a shipping build it doesn't perform that is a check. You would just get a crash. So this is used for a couple of reasons. A it's slightly more performant because that is a is pulled out of the flow in shipping builds, but also it kind of conveys intention. Cast-checked is something that you would use in code when you want two things to be very very tightly linked to say I don't want this to be optional, this needs to be this thing. So an example of that might be the behaviour tree component in the AI controller. Nothing else should be in that pointer. So you can be essentially saying this needs to be this thing.",
