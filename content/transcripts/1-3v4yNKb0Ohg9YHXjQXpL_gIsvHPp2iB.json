  "text": " Let's talk about some post-processing effects and the ways you can edit your scene to get the desired result. Now there's a couple of different ways we can do post-processing. So what are post-processing effects and how do they work? Now a post-process can either be applied via a volume or as we saw before in the camera settings. They are screen space only and they are on by default. So post-processing volumes are how you control the effect. So the post-process in Unreal Engine is already turned on and it's up to you on how to dial it in. They can be specified for each cine camera actor as well. So you know just because you have a certain post-process on one camera doesn't mean that that needs to be applied to all the cameras. You can actually change the post-process depending on the camera as well, depending on the desired effect. Maybe you want a lens flare effect on certain cameras and not on others. That's easily done with the post-processing on the camera. So the ways that we can actually do this are through a box volume and I'll show you how to add that to your scene in a second. And these can be used together with a weighted priority. So you can add a volume around a certain area and that can set the post-process but it can also overlap with other post-process volumes and you can decide the weighting on how to blend between one post-process effect and another. You can also unbound the constraints of the volume. So if you just want one global post-process effect, we can also do that and I'll show you how to do that right now. So if we come out of our sequencer and we look at our scene and we have this post-processing volume here, I'll just delete this for the purposes of what we need and we will go to post, post-process and post-process volume. Now we have our post-process volume in the map. What we were referring to with the unbound before was if I type unbound, I can tick this and essentially what that means is this will affect the overall world property rather than just inside the box. So to give you an example of this, I'll just clear out the unbound and I will change the scale of this to 5, press tab 5, press tab 5. So we've got this larger post-process box here. So what we will maybe do as a very heavy-handed effect is if we scroll down maybe to maybe a global saturation or something like this. So we can set the colors. Let's try setting some shadows, midtones, this kind of thing. I'll close the sequencer out as well so we can see these being edited at runtime. So we can change this, double-click the value, maybe we've just completely desaturated the scene. Maybe let's dial in the contrast as well. Let's just go very heavy-handed and stylistic. So we've got our post-process scene. We've edited some properties. Again, you want to go in and dial in your post-processing to a very specific feel, but you can see that overall we've got some cool lens effect, lens flaring going on and if we zoom out of our volume, this is still being unaffected because unbound is set to infinite extent. So let's untick this. So we've got our global post-processing and when we get inside this volume, you'll see that it is affected only when we go inside this volume. And then when we talk about weighting, you can blend the weight between two different volumes. So if you had one post-process that was slightly more heavily weighted, you could blend into that and you can see that the effect isn't as heavy. And again, you can really just control how you would like the post-processing to look. And of course, as we mentioned previously, you can also affect post-processing within the camera, exactly how I've been doing there, but with the different post-processing here in inside the camera. So again, if you want certain lens flares to happen only on cameras, I believe there's the flare property. Yeah. So you can have lens flares just on the camera. You can set intensities, you can set bockers, any kind of tints that you want there. And again, it's very customisable, shall we say. So a couple of different things that we've covered here. We've covered a post-process volume. We can unbound it to the entire level or we can just bound it to inside the extents of the box. And then we can also manipulate the post-process based on the camera. Now you can set up post-process materials, which are useful to dig into and you can set a material to be used on the post-process chain under the blending setting after the tone mapper. So you can say blendable location on the post-process material. You can say after tone mapping, I want this thing to happen. Now there's a material example here, which you are, feel free to follow and you can decide how you want to overlay certain information. You can add scalar parameters, then then lurp them into the desired result. But there's a lot of flexibility for post-processing to be had with inside of Unreal Engine.",
