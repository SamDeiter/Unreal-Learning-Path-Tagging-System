  "text": " With our physical material now set up, the last thing that we're going to do is put in the landscape visibility mask so that we can have holes inside of our landscape to allow any users to go underneath our landscape. Well, we are not necessarily going to be building any elaborate cave systems or anything like that. This is just a really good thing to know about in case your project does require some type of cave system. And here is an example on the screen of what I'm talking about. Here we have just a normal area and then we have the masked area. And what is actually happening is we're actually painting this out and not only are we painting the visual data out, but we're also painting the collision. Now, this is actually fairly easy to set up inside of our material. Now, if you want to get a little bit more advanced with your setup, you can select each individual landscape tile and there is this landscape hole material which will allow you to specify a specific material instead of having to have a specific material. For our project here, what we're going to do is I'm going to hit control space and I'm going to open up our matte landscape, and I'm going to go ahead and select the landscape. And then we're going to go ahead and select the landscape material. And here we go. And we're going to go ahead and select the landscape material. For our project here, what we're going to do is I'm going to hit control space and I'm going to open up our matte landscape. And so first things first, we're going to come over here to our blend mode and we're going to change this to mask. And then I'm going to zoom in here. And over here we have our opacity mask. So we're going to look for our landscape and we want our landscape visibility mask. So right there. And then we're just going to plug this in like so. Once that's done, let's make sure we apply this and save. And while that saves, the next thing that we need to do is in order to use this, we have to come over to the sculpt section of our landscape tools, click on visibility, and then we can paint in our visibility or hide our visibility just like we're sculpting in landscape. So let's take a look at that now. All right. I'm going to go ahead and close this down. And then I'm going to come up here to our selection, to our landscape. I'm going to come over to sculpt. And then we're going to look for our visibility, which is right here. And then make sure my brush isn't too large. And then I'm just going to hold down the left mouse button and you can see that I'm starting to paint in there. And then if I hold down shift, you can see that I've added that right back. And let's just go ahead and show you that we can actually go through this. We're just going to play from right here. Check this out. Just drop right off there. So it does create a hole that you can go inside of. And again, this is useful for anything, a cave system. If you want to have maybe a house that is partially inset inside of the landscape or, you know, you've got maybe a very large building and you have subfloors that need to go underneath the terrain and you don't necessarily want to get rid of a square component or push it all the way down. This is a great way to get rid of those landscape areas, both visually and remove the collision.",
