  "text": " When it comes to the tools available in Engine for your control rig, let's take a look at some of the functions and control types that can be useful when you're building a mechanical rig. Very often you'll find that something mechanical will contain a piston, whether this is part of an engine or a large robot arm or just there to support the movement in some other way. And for these scenarios, there is a function built into the engine called the Piston function. And that acts as a two-way aim constraint, allowing two elements of the rig, so bones or controls or nulls, to always be pointing towards one another. So if each end of the piston is anchored to a different mesh, say for example like the upper and lower leg of a robotic character, this function will enable those pieces to stay anchored where they are and then always aim towards one another, maintaining that functionality of the piston. Something else that's useful is the FK chain function. Now this is for a basic forward kinematic setup, where you just need a control to drive the movement of a bone. But something great about this is you can actually filter out different translation and rotation axes and just have it moving in one direction or rotating in one direction if that's what you need. When it comes to more complex robotic arms or legs, you might have something like a mechanical arm that you're using on an assembly line, for example. And for this you could use the IK3 bone function, which is a great way to get those moving where you need precise movement for the end bone in the chain, maybe it's a claw picking something up on an assembly line, and you need the rest of the arm to calculate its movement automatically. And when it comes to dynamic movement for your mesh, so this would be things like cables or chains on your mechanical mesh, there are a couple of useful functions that help you get some dynamic movement. So there is the local chain dynamics function, which will apply a sort of physics effect to a chain of bones, just using maths. And there is the add jiggle function that simulates on just one element of the rig, which might be a bone or a control, rather than an entire chain of bones. And it essentially uses a spring interpolate node to try and reach a target, whilst also allowing you to add a delay and damping on its movement, so it looks like it's jiggling as the rest of the mesh is moving. Taking a look at some useful control types here, depending on what type of control you create, you can actually give it different limits and force it to move in different ways. So we have a mechanical arm here that's been set up. And for this yellow control here, if we were to select it, you'll see that we can't rotate in either the y or z axis, we can only rotate in the x axis. And that's because for this type of control, we've set it to be a rotator. That means it only has rotation, it only has the possibility to rotate. And under the settings here, we're actually able to give it some min and max settings. So if you were to activate min and max for x and y, sorry, for y and z, and to set them both at zero, that would limit the movement so that it can't move in those axes, and you can only move in the open one. You can also change this to a position, for example, if you wanted to only have translation values, which can also be very handy. Now something else that has a slightly more complex setup is a float control here. If I just zoom in, you can see that as we move this float control down, this claw opens up and as we move it back, it closes. And that's because we're essentially converting the transform information or the float that comes out of the movement of this control into rotation information for these two claw bones. And in utilising these different control types with their min and max settings, you can quickly get something moving in a mechanical way when you're locking down the different axes in which it shouldn't be able to move.",
