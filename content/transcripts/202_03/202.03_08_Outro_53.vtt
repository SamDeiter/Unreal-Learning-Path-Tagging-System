00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So that brings us to the end of the tool creation class.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you for sticking with us.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's just do a quick recap of what we've covered.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we talked about the theory of tool making, where a lot of it's about considering what you want this tool to do and where you would like this or how you would like this to be triggered.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We've then gone through four exercises and made a few different tools.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.000
First, we started looking at construction script where we use that for a mesh scattering and we improved that so that it used the line trace to connect to the floor.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We then made an exposed function that allowed us to bake out the meshes that we had scattered.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Next up, we created an editor utility widget and we just used that in order to do another line trace in front of the camera and spawn meshes accordingly.

9
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We created a function in this instance so that the same code could be reused over and over again.

10
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Finally, we made a mass rename using an editor asset utility.

11
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And as a final byproduct, we had a quick look at an actor action utility which demonstrated where we would be able to place a trigger connected to the right-hand click menu of an actor within the level.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I hope you got some value out of that and thanks a lot for following them.

13
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Goodbye.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
