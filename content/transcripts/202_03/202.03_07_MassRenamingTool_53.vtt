00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello and welcome to this video on Editor Asset Utilities.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.400
In this we will be doing an exercise where we will be making a mass asset renaming tool.

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.860
Ok, let's jump into the editor and we're going to create a new asset.

4
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.960
So if you right-hand click, if we come up to Editor Utilities, this time let's select

5
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.200
the Editor Utility Blueprint.

6
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.960
This is going to give us a number of different choices.

7
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.360
We are going to select an Asset Action Utility.

8
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:59.320
And I'm going to call this S-A-A-U underscore rename.

9
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.160
And I'm going to double click to open this up.

10
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.360
Again this will look a little bit like the blueprints we've previously been working with.

11
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.720
But one of the things you might notice is we have no viewport in this situation.

12
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.560
We do not need them.

13
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.720
Now an Asset Action Utility works a little bit like a code library.

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.960
So we could write a number of different functions and these would be available anywhere in the

15
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.640
content browser by right clicking on the appropriate assets.

16
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.160
The first thing we're going to want to do is create a new function.

17
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:48.860
And I'm going to call this Rename.

18
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.900
So what I'll do is I will select the purple node.

19
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.640
And you can see over on the right hand side we have options for input.

20
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:10.800
I'm going to hit once and I'm going to call this the Free Fix.

21
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.500
And this is going to be of the type String.

22
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.860
And I'm going to add another one.

23
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.760
And this is going to be the Post Fix.

24
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.400
So this function is going to take in two variables, Prefix and Postfix.

25
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520
And we're going to just put the prefix before the name of any of the assets we're going

26
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.500
to change and the Postfix we're going to put after it.

27
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.600
So let's write some code.

28
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.960
So the first thing that we're going to do is drag off and we're going to want to get

29
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.000
selected assets.

30
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.360
What this is going to do is it will return an array of any of the assets which you have

31
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.380
selected within the content browser.

32
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.700
So say I came up into here.

33
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.640
I'm going to reduce this just down to materials.

34
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.120
If I selected these four materials, it would return an array with these four materials.

35
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:35.840
And I come in here and I will do a for each loop.

36
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.540
Now all I want to do is rename the asset that we have here.

37
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.540
If I type in rename asset.

38
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.820
So whatever I would input here is going to be the new name of the asset.

39
00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.820
We want this to be a string concatenation of our inputs and the actual name.

40
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.760
So I'll drag off of this and I'm going to type in append.

41
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.920
And I'm going to add an extra pin by clicking on the add pin here.

42
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:24.760
Now I'm going to get the object name.

43
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.760
I'm going to connect that up to the B pin.

44
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.720
And I'm going to grab the prefix and put it in the first pin and the post fix and put

45
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.540
it in the C pin.

46
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.260
Now this is our entire code at this point.

47
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.500
So all we're doing is getting the selected assets that we have.

48
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.800
And for each of them, we're going to rename them, putting the prefix at the beginning

49
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.520
and the post fix at the end.

50
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:05.360
And if I now hit compile and save, and then if I jump back to our asset browser, let's

51
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.520
do this with one to start with.

52
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.120
So we've got our basic floor.

53
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.860
If I right-hand click on this, you can see that we now have an option for scripted asset

54
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860
actions.

55
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.780
And next to them, they've got the option for rename.

56
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.220
If I click on this rename, I'm going to get a pop-up box.

57
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.300
It's going to ask me for a prefix and it's going to ask me for a post fix.

58
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.900
And so I'm going to call, I'm going to say this is pre underscore and I will do underscore

59
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.200
post on the other side and click OK.

60
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.300
Now because this is in alphabetical order, we've now lost it.

61
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.060
If I was to search for pre, you can see we have pre, m, basic floor and post.

62
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.740
So that's working.

63
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.020
Now the other nice thing about this is we could come in and we could select, let's select

64
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.020
all of these assets.

65
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.140
We could select as many assets as you wanted.

66
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.420
Right-hand click and under asset scripted actions, rename.

67
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.540
And I'm going to call this.

68
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.340
A underscore and at the end, I'm going to do the underscore and hit OK.

69
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.700
You can see now all of these assets have been updated in one quick go.

70
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.860
The main reason why these asset action utilities are really useful is because they'll

71
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:48.060
automatically appear when you right-hand click and select the assets in the browser.

72
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.060
And I could create numerous ones.

73
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.020
So if I just added another one, for example, and I change this to be hello.

74
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:07.820
And I print string hello and compile, save, jump back in.

75
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.140
Right-hand click, you see under scripted actions, we now got hello as well.

76
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.580
Hello appears in the top left hand corner.

77
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.380
So the trigger, and that's the main thing, the trigger for this is going to be on the

78
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.340
scripted asset actions.

79
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.740
Now what you might find is that you actually want these options to only appear for a

80
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.860
specific class and you can do that.

81
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.780
So if I was to come up here and I was to select class defaults, we have a list here

82
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.700
of supported classes.

83
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.820
If I was to push plus, I could select to only show this on materials.

84
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.860
And now these options would only appear for materials or classes that are children of

85
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.660
materials.

86
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.380
So, for example, if I was to grab this, just control P, right-hand click, the

87
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.780
scripted asset options would not appear here.

88
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.980
However, if I was to jump to the material, right-hand click, you'd see that we do have

89
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.060
the scripted asset actions here.

90
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.420
So you can see how that's a really useful tool to just very quickly create tools that

91
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.420
can run against a lot of different things.

92
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.540
Now, say you wanted to do the same thing and add a menu option in, but this time for a

93
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.660
actor rather than an asset.

94
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.940
Let's just demonstrate that quickly.

95
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:45.340
So if I come into here again, I come to editor utilities and I select an editor utility

96
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.220
blueprint.

97
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.380
Now it's not any of these.

98
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.340
What I actually need to search for is if I search for utility, you can see that we have

99
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.460
actor action utility here.

100
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:06.860
I'm going to select that and I'm going to call this act action utility example.

101
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.420
If I double click on this again, if I just create another function and I'm going to call

102
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:23.860
this hello and I'll drag off here, search for a print string.

103
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.900
Hello.

104
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.260
Compile save.

105
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:35.180
Now, if I select our chair, right-hand click, you will see here at the bottom, we have

106
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.380
scripted actor actions.

107
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.300
I can just select that as hello.

108
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.940
Now, say we wanted to get hold of the selected actors.

109
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:53.860
So if I delete this, grab one of these and I go get selection, get selection set.

110
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.860
That is going to return us all the selected actors.

111
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.380
So I could do a for each loop.

112
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.220
Like that.

113
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.300
And all I'm going to do is I'm going to destroy these actors.

114
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.660
So this is a quick way to go and destroy everything that you've selected.

115
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.300
Of course, you could just press delete, but this is a good example of how you can

116
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.300
implement something on an entire selection set.

117
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.300
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this.

118
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.300
I'm going to go ahead and delete this.

119
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.980
So this is a good example of how you can implement something on an entire selection set.

120
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.820
So if I grabbed a couple of these.

121
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.820
Right-hand click, come down to scripted actions, do hello, and everything's gone.

122
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.740
So again, it's just an example of how you could create an action and you can do

123
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.420
anything from the trigger.

124
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.940
What's more important is where the trigger is.

125
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.740
So you'll know that if you want to trigger something on a specific asset,

126
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.860
then you could do it using an actor action utility.

127
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.100
Okay.

128
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.540
So that is the last of our examples.

129
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.100
Thank you very much for sticking with us.
