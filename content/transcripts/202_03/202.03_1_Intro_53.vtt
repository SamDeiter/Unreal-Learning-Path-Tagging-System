Hello, my name's Edward Bennett and I'm an instructor here at Epic Games.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'd like to welcome you to Tool Creation for version 5.1.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This course was originally written in Unreal Engine 5.1, but the tools are common across all of five.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So you should be fine working in any version of five.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this course, we're going to start off by going over some toolmaking theory in the engine.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It shouldn't take much more than 10 minutes.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then the rest of the course is going to be pretty much hands on exercises.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Each of these exercises, there's an expectation that will take around half an hour.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So the first exercise we'll be doing will be on the using the construction script where we will be scattering meshes.

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Second exercise, we will be baking out those meshes using the exposed function commands.

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Third exercise, we'll be building an editor utility widget to quickly spawn meshes.

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And finally, we will be creating a editor asset utility to do some renaming.

13
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So that's it for the introduction.

14
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's jump into a bit of theory in the next video.
