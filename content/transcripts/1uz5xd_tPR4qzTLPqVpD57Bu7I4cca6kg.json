  "text": " Now that we know how to import our character and animations, let's jump in and take a look at our character in the engine and check out the different animation sub-editors to see how we can preview our animations and get a basic understanding of how to navigate through the different animation editors and what you can do with each one. To preview our character in the engine, we want to open up the Skeletal Mesh. And you can see that's one of these pink icons just here. And you can tell that just because it says Skeletal Mesh at the bottom of the icon, or if you hover over it, it'll also tell you it's a Skeletal Mesh just in brackets at the top there. So if we double click this, this opens up our Skeletal Mesh editor. Now this is where we can preview our Skeletal Mesh, our character, which has the skeleton here and it has the mesh that we have skinned to it. Now this is also where you would assign the materials for your character. So just down here in the asset details, you can assign any materials that you might have, as well as LOD information that you might need to set up for your character just below. You can also see you've got access to your skeleton tree here. So you can see all of the bones for your characters or any sockets that you might have set up to attach things to your characters that you'd find in here as well. And another useful window here is the Morph Target Preview window. So this allows you to preview any Morph Targets that you've got set up for your character. So if you set up any blend shapes in an external software and brought them into the engine, this is where you'd be able to preview them and turn them on and off and see whether or not they're working correctly. And along the top right of the toolbar here, you'll see we've got a few different icons. Now these give you access to the other animation sub editor windows. So whenever you're in one of these windows, you will always have these icons at the top to give you access to the other windows. So we can jump through to the skeleton. We can see any animations, any animation blueprints or physics assets that are related to this Skeletal Mesh that we have open. So if we jump into the skeleton here, this is where you would access and edit your skeleton. So on the left hand side here, you can see all the bones that are in your skeleton. You can select any of these and you can manipulate them and just see how your mesh is deforming. You could also attach or create sockets, should I say, for your skeleton, which is what you'd use to attach items to your character, whether that's at runtime or through sequences or however you want to do that. You can also preview attachments inside this window here as well if you have a socket. Now on the right hand side here, you have your preview scene settings tab. So if you have multiple Skeletal Meshes that are using the same skeleton, this is where you could change the preview for those. So you can see on the right hand side here, we've got two different Skeletal Meshes that use this same socket. Now we can swap between those and see what that preview looks like. And again, you can just manipulate the joints there just to see how that deformation works. And on the bottom right here, we have the Asset Browser. Now this is where you can access animations or blend spaces or montages that are being used with this skeleton or the Skeletal Mesh. Now, if we double click and open up one of these animation sequences here, you can see that it automatically opens up this animation sequence editor window. And you can see that on the top right here with the icon that's highlighted. This is where you would preview your animations. So inside here, again, you've got access to your skeleton tree. You can see all the joints if you need those. There's also the Asset Details tab. So this is where you could modify or edit any animation related properties. So you could change the rate scale and make the animation quicker or slow it down. You could also activate or deactivate root motion. So if your animation has root motion, you can turn that on and off just here. And a host of other animation related properties. You also have access again to the Preview Scene Settings tab. So we could change that to be Quinn again and just see that animation is looking with that character. If you're perhaps trying to use the same animation with multiple characters, just make sure it looks good and it's working with the multiple characters that you have. And along the bottom here is the timeline. So this is obviously where you can scrub through the animation forwards and backwards. You can add notifies. So these green icons here, which just trigger code essentially to do something at running the animation. You can also access the curves related to this character that might be blend shape curves or they could be bone tracks that you have set up for your character. You'll be able to see that in the window just down the bottom here. And again, you have the asset browser. So again, if you have another animation that you want to jump to, you could just double click, open any of those up and also things like blend spaces. So you could preview those here. So if I hit play here, we can go from there. Play here. We can go from the slow walk to the standard walk and then blend into the run. So you can preview all that stuff in here as well. Now, something else you can do, which isn't immediately clear if I just jump back to one of the animations rather than the blend space, is you can actually edit this animation in Sequencer. So if you hit these two little arrows at the top here, choose edit in Sequencer and then edit with FK Control Rig. That'll then give you an option to bake this down to the FK Control Rig within a Sequencer. So if I click bake to Control Rig. And I go to our level here. We can see that as we scrub through this, our animation has been baked down to this Control Rig here. So what I could do is grab one of these controls, which just represent each bone in the body. Maybe I can just grab a few of these and delete them and add a new key where he raises his arm. And you'll see that as I scrub through this, the arm now raises up and down. And what you can do with that, if I just go back to the top, is right click the character and bake animation sequence. And that just means we can save this as a new animation or we could even overwrite the existing animation and it's just a really nice way and a quick way of making edits to existing animations that you have inside the project. Now, we do have a lot of other courses that go over Sequencer and Control Rigs in much more detail. So be sure to check those out if that's something that you want to learn more about. Our next animation editor window is the Animation Blueprint. So if we click this icon just up here, here we have the Animation Blueprint, which is essentially a tool which controls the animations of the skeletal mesh by allowing you to blend animations, control bones and create different logic that essentially defines the final animation pose. So in here we've got two main graphs. We have the Event Graph and the Anim Graph. So if I double click that, here's the Event Graph. And this is similar to a regular blueprint where you can handle different events and variables and logic that would trigger a change in state of the animation. And then you have the Anim Graph. Now, this is where you would define the final animation output pose. So where you can control the blending of the animations, set up state machines and things that basically determine the final animation output pose. So essentially, the Event Graph takes information like player input and then passes that along to the Anim Graph. And the Anim Graph determines what animation should be playing based on that input. And finally, we have the Physics Editor window just at the top right here. Now, this is where you would create and edit any of the collision bodies that will be used for your skeletal mesh in relation to any physics that you have going on in your project. So maybe you want to make your character ragdoll or have things bump into your character. You'd use this window here to edit all of these physics bodies that you can see, adding and deleting from the skeleton tree on the left hand side here, and then readjusting and repositioning the viewport to make sure they fit your character mesh properly and to ensure that things react correctly with the mesh.",
