  "text": " Now that we know a little bit about what the merge actor tool does, I'd like to talk about the hierarchical level of detail tool or HLOD. HLOD is a way to replace lots of individual static mesh actors with one single static mesh actor that has one material and because of this it's going to be cheaper to render. This tool works by going through all of the static meshes placed in your level and it will group them based on their distance from one another. It will then create new mesh and materials to replace the static meshes in those groups so that as the user progresses through the world, distance detail will be cheaper to render and as the user gets closer and closer to that detail it will then be replaced with the original static meshes. Again, the main reason to use these tools are to help lessen the rendering cost of your levels, objects and the distance. Now to access the HLOD tools or the hierarchical level of detail outliner, you need to go to window and then select hierarchical LOD outliner from the menu. If this option is grayed out, that means you are using a level that works with world partition We will cover how to set up HLOD with world partition later on in this video tutorial. Let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now and have a look at how this works. Now inside of the Unreal Engine 5 editor, let's look at how we can utilize HLOD. So our example here, what we're going to try and do is we're going to try to make different HLOD groups that include this table, the chairs and the statue as well as the little platform underneath them and then make another group that contains these two over here as well as these two over here and then make one final group that actually includes everything together. And to do this there's a couple of things we need to do first. First off we're going to need to open up the tool by coming up here to window and then hierarchical LOD outliner and this is going to open up our tool for us. Now if we try to do regenerate or build nothing is going to happen and that's because under our HLOD system, notice we have no HLOD setup asset. Now a setup asset allows us to actually share this setup among different levels. If we're just working in a single level and we don't need to have additional levels, if we come over here to world settings under HLOD system under the hierarchical LOD setup, if we press this plus what we're going to do is we are going to add our different levels here so we can again set this up using a blueprint asset and we can do that by coming here to our content browser. We can right click, come to our blueprint class. We want to come down to our all classes and we're going to look for our, not our blueprint, I'm sorry, our HLOD and then we can select our hierarchical LOD setup and click select. And let's just double click on this to open it up. So one of the things else that we can do is we don't need to use the blueprint graph so if we close this and we come here and we actually open this again we're going to get this without the full blueprint graph as a data only blueprint. Now before I go further depending on which one we use the settings are going to be the same whether we set this up in a level or set this up as an asset. So let's take a look at the settings really quick. First off we have cluster generation. Cluster generation allows us to control the size at which static meshes should be considered to be in this cluster. So if I have two static meshes sitting next to one another and a desired bounds of 2000, if those meshes are within 2000 Unreal units of one another they will be inside of this cluster. The other settings that I have here control things like how much of this asset needs to be inside of this cluster to be considered part of this cluster so we can make things more aggressive or less aggressive. Underneath cluster generation settings we have our mesh generation settings. What this allows us to do is actually generate brand new geometry and materials based on the settings that we need for our individual project. We can either merge things down so that they require one mesh and one material or if that doesn't work we can actually generate brand new meshes and materials that completely replace the objects we have selected for using HLOD. For our system here what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit this HLOD level 0. I'm going to hit once and then I'm going to hit it again and under our cluster generation settings I'm going to set this first value to something really low like 225. I'm going to come here to our HLOD level 1 and I'm going to set this one to something like I don't know like 1800 and then I'm going to set this very last one to something like well say 2000 would be good. Let's go ahead and compile and save that and what we can do here is if I hit control space make sure I have that selected I can come here and add that and regenerate my clusters. Once I've done that what's going to happen is you can see here I have my HLOD actor 0 which is right here. I have my second one which is going to be over there and then my third one which is over there and then my fourth one and then my second level is going to contain actually the HLOD actor contains these three and the floor and then this one contains those two and the floor there. Not exactly what I wanted but we could adjust the values a little bit but it's close enough we did want them split into two actors. Last but not least we have this last HLOD level that's actually going to be the floor over here and everything pretty much combined together so this is good this is exactly what we want. Now that we know that everything is working I'm going to hit this build all and we'll be right back once this builds to show you what it's actually doing. All right now that that's built what we've done is a couple of really really cool things here now this will automatically switch the level of detail levels you can see here as I start to move away the statue makes a very obvious switch right there but one of the things that it's also doing is it's also actually reducing the number of triangles versus what I'm seeing here up close so up close each one of these little bits of chairs tables and statues are going to consume about let's say about 10,000 triangles now using the HLOD system when it combines all of this together and we see the statue is something like this that's actually only 2400 triangles or about 25 percent reduction or I'm sorry remained about a 75 percent reduction in triangles now this gets further reduced as we start to go down the LOD levels if I come here and I go to my LOD level one which is this right here check this out this would be 30,000 and that gets reduced about 7500 again down here this one would be 10,000 and that gets reduced to 2600 finally if we go to our very last LOD level we're going to see here that it would come in at about 40,000 and it's been reduced to 10,000 retaining again about 25 percent 26 percent across the board so this is a really really really amazing thing that we can do in terms of performance the other cool thing about this is check this out so I'm just gonna come here I'm gonna hit ctrl H to let's see unhide everything not sure why it's decided to not show up so let's just regenerate clusters real quick and there we go I wanted to do this because the system once we have it set up if I come here and I move something like this maybe oops I didn't want to actually do that want to disable that there we go wanted to do something like this you know and then maybe I'll come over here and I'll even do something like add a cube here it's a cube we'll even make it a little more fancy we'll come here to our got some starter content and we'll come to our materials and we'll just add like this concrete tile and we'll add like this brick here maybe we'll do something else we'll add like a metal or something like that so let's go ahead and build all them we'll be right back check this out all right now that we have everything built let's go ahead and see what's going on so we have our LOD set to auto so as I start to move around the scene what's gonna happen is it's going to automatically change we can see here there's a change back there if we were to select some different things we would see like this is gonna be our big LOD actor back there let's take a closer look at what's going on by just coming here and doing our LOD 1 so there's our LOD 1 our LOD or I should say LOD 1 that's what I wanted to click on and then we can come down to our LOD 2 so you can see here it's actually changing everything for us and we have the ability to control all of these settings and again if we come back to our I come up here and I'm gonna browse to this inside of our content browser and open it up real quick there we go if we come down to this mesh generation you can see here under our merge settings we have all types of different settings that we can adjust that will affect how this is merged down we also can change the simple for medication method from merged to simplified which will give us a new proxy geometry or approximate now the difference between approximate and simplify have to deal with if you're using nanite or not if you're using NAN non nanite meshes you'll want to use simplify if you're using approximate you'll want to use that for any nanite meshes well the hierarchical level of detail tool works great for single levels in the next part of this video we're gonna show you how you can work with the hierarchical level of detail tool when it comes to world partition or massive open world style levels now that we understand how the H LOD system works let's talk about H LOD when using things like world partition now on the screen in front of us we have the editor using the world partition map and I've set up something similar to what we had before the table and chairs and the statue and above each statue is a little bit of text and this text says approximate mesh simplified mesh instancing and merge mesh now if I come up here to window I want to point out that the hierarchical LOD outliner is not here and the reason it's not here is that while this tool is the way we use this tool is slightly different what we do is for the type of H LOD system we wish a certain mesh to use we can assign that mesh an H LOD asset so for example if I come over here to this approximate mesh if I come over to the details panel and I'm just gonna search for H LOD we can see here under the H LOD layer if I pull this over we're gonna have the H LOD approximate merge mesh now if I browse to this asset and open it up you're gonna see here that it is an asset that can exist inside of the content browser and then underneath here I have my mesh approximate settings which I can adjust and if I look at the other settings here or the other mesh as I should say you can see here I have the simplified mesh which is gonna simplify our mesh and instancing and so on and so forth all the way down to merge mesh now again to make these all you do is you come in here we are gonna right-click and go to miscellaneous and then we select H LOD layer once we've done that we give it a name and then when we open it up we just simply select the layer type we wish up here at the top and since seeing merge mesh simplified mesh or approximate mesh once we've built our level of details we'll then see the results and one of the cool things that we can actually do here is I'm actually gonna hide this I'm gonna come here to this LOD and I'm gonna unhide these by clicking on these little pins here this will unhide this for us might get a little error here but one of the cool things that we can do and we're gonna unhide this one as well is when we select on these if we want to rebuild this and we can see kind of the the results here what we can do is we can select this we can actually not right-click but select one of these and then inside of the details panel we can click on this build H LOD and this will actually build this one single H LOD so anything that we have done to it will be built so let's just give this a second to finish up and we'll make a change and we'll come right back. All right and thanks to a little bit of movie magic we have now finished rebuilding that one so it took a little bit longer than I expected but the results are still what we're seeing right here in front of us we get this for the approximate mesh we get this for the simplified mesh one thing about simplified mesh I want to point out even though it looks bad it's actually meant to be viewed probably about from like this far away so just keep that in mind that's why it kind of breaks down so much it's not actually meant to be viewed very very close like it is because it's gonna try to simplify this thing around kind of like a volume so instancing is going to allow us to have some instances now again one thing I'm going to point about instancing is we have this static mesh instant component we have another component and another one still we need to make sure because we see we have these static mesh and the table and then the chair so this right here is two or three of them but these two are going to be unique so just keep that in mind we want to make sure that when we instance we're instancing things that are all of the same type it's not to say that you can't have multiple objects that aren't of the same type make use of instancing it's just not going to be as efficient finally down here we have our merged mesh this is literally going to make us a new mesh here that is actually completely all merged together with everything using the lowest level of detail so it's going to make things a little bit cheaper so again the thing to take away from this is that when we utilize HLOD inside of our world partition level we assign our individual actors in HLOD asset that is created inside of the browser here and we can then use that asset to make adjustments to groups on a whole you",
