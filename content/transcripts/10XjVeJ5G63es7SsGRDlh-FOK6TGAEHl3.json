  "text": " So, let's look at fixing this crane. What we can see here is we can see, well I'll turn off my focus, we can see that we're cutting through, we're playing it. So, we've got all kinds of craziness going on here. So, the first thing we want to do is fix this rotation issue. This can sometimes happen with cameras, especially when they're going past their orientation of rotation. So, let's just look at the curves. This is a good opportunity to look at fixing the curves. So, we'll show the animation key curve editor if this ever happens to you. Sometimes it's easier to just delete the curve and start again, delete the keys and start again, but let's go into fixing this curve. So we're looking at the rotation value here. So, I'm just going to select this rotation and you can see that the yaw, which is this blue line, is going way up here and then coming back down to the correct rotation. So let's just dial this in. Let's just do that and then if I pin this curve editor here, we can scroll along the timeline again and we can see that although we want the yaw to still be looking at the performance, it's at least not doing anything too extreme for now. So let's again, let's zoom in here. Let's dial this down again. I'm just going to right mouse drag and move this into frame again. I'm going to drop it down a little bit more. And again, it sees little tweaks that can take a little while, but then they're worth it in the performance. So dialing into the dancers performance and that'll do for now. So the main thing here and then we can end the shot, which is looking pretty nice, but so we can close the sequence editor. I think the main thing now is to fix this arm length issue. We can see the arm overextended. It's kind of nice if we can get close to the building because it's kind of a nice in focus close up shot, but we also don't want it to be intersecting geometry. So we'll go to the crane, go to the arm length. Maybe we dial this down to 1750. Again, whatever your scene's composition is, 1750 might just miss it. Let's see. So we're zooming out. That's definitely too far. I think the 1750 could have been more like 1700 maybe that might miss it, but then we're definitely, definitely overextended here. So let's bring this back down to 1700 as well. Definitely still too far out. So let's bring it down to 1600. That might, might work, but you can see as we're editing it, we're just manipulating the content as we go just to get an idea 1600. Let's just dial it into 1400 and just be happy with that. We'll see where we get to. And then we just want to close out the scene. So a little bit of intersecting, but it's fine. And we may want to extend that frame out. I think the main thing I want to do here is just to get across the principles of how to use a camera and you can spend hours and hours tweaking all the small details and definitely worth the payoff and it definitely needs that refinement. But in this instance, you probably get the idea. So I'm just going to unlock from the camera. I'm going to go up to the end frame. So the last shot I'm going to end on black. So I'm going to end, add a key for the black screen here and we're using 751 frames. So it's kind of good process here just to close out the scene for it being 751. So I'll set the end to 751, which just dials in the end of the scene. You can also move out this, this point here to set it yourself. We're snapping on, you can get close, but to really dial it in, you can just type in 751 frames. That looks good. We're at 30 frames a second and we're ending on a black screen. So now we just want to make sure we add a fade in. So I'm going to move to the fade in. I'm going to hit zero. We'll bring the frame in and then as we get out, I'll set a zero again to bring the fade. Now, the last thing we want to do is unmute the fade track. Maybe this fade here is a little bit too long now that we've got a fade track. So let's just dial that in a little bit and let's look at what we've got so far. We should have a panning shot. We should have a rail camera and we should have a camera crane shot. One thing that I've realized we've not done though is on this frame here, we want to cut to the crane camera. So we add our last camera cut of the day. So let's go to crane, crane money. And now let's see how our sequence looks. So we've got our panning shot that we started off with. We rack focus. Got our focus walking off. We've got our rail camera here. We look, we look to the runner. And although now we'll probably break the 180 degree line, let's see where we get to. We've got our camera crane. We've got a camera fade and we kind of zoom out at the end. Now that'd be way nicer to spend a bit more time on that exterior shot there. We want to leave the frame over the course of probably three times the length of that. But we're in a good place. We've covered a lot of ground with cinematics and sequencer. And so let's move on to some post-processing.",
