  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson, we're going to go ahead and create the grunge a layered material and the material layer blend to bring it all together. So let's get started. Now in the previous video, we went in here and we created our tile setup and we kept it pretty simple. Now, again, this can be anything that you want it to be. And let's go ahead and expose that last one we've kind of forgot about. Let's go and put our tile texture, or you can just call it albedo. There we go. And we have everything exposed. Let's go and expose that last one here, which would be our normals. Oh, looks like we already got it. My bad. So we got everything set up on this one. Let's go ahead and build our grunge or what we could use for grunge. And we have the material already set up. If you followed along in the last video, and let's go and double click on that one. He's off screen, so let's bring him over. There we go. And we're going to kind of repeat the last process we had before. It's going to be pretty simple stuff. So we're going to go ahead and create a make material attributes. So make material attributes. There we go. Place that right here, plug that right into that input material attribute. There we go. And again, they act like material functions. They kind of act as a gateway to be able to customize the material any way that we want. And we're going to go ahead and pull in the grunge. Now this grunge can be anything that you choose. I'm going to choose the T underscore grime. So I'm going to keep my finger on T key, left click, and we're going to go ahead and look for T in our details, T underscore grime. There it is. We had a couple locations for it. We'll just grab this one. We also need another one for normal. So I'll keep my finger on T key, left click, and we'll do under the details, T underscore again, G for grime. Let's do RI to get more populated in there in our search. And then we'll grab the normal and punch it in here. Now again, this can be anything that you want. So if you want to, and what I mean by that, you can add as much as you need in these slots, whatever fits the scenario. And I'm going to keep my finger on the M key again. And I'm going to keep my finger on the S key. And this will be the scalar. So this be normal amount. And this is going to be known as our grime. So because we're going to have a couple of normal amounts, if they pop up, put that here, put that over here, and then we're going to put this right in here. Now if you want to do the same thing, they'll be to you can, I'm going to save that last step. I'm going to grab that multiply here and put that right into the normal there. There we go. And we'll just hit apply. So we know that that guy's working. And the last one here, we'll hit apply to that guy's working too. Now you typically you'll hit save. But since I use this file quite often, I'm not going to hit save on this one. So we know that we have our two material blends ready to go. Our layers, I should say. Now we need to go into the material layer blend. Now in my notes, it talks about how going we can go straight to the parent material, which we will. But in this case, we're going to go to the blend first, because it's just a little easier to work with. And I think you can follow along a little bit better here because you may get some errors if you start trying to plug things in without that material layer blend. That thing's kind of important. So I'm going to go ahead and double click on our material. It's off screen. So let me go and pull that over. There we go. And we're going to go ahead and build this out. Now we're going to make this a little bit more complicated. Then I have two different versions in my slides, one that's super simple and it fades it in and out, kind of like you saw with the Megascans example. Now we want to have it so that the grunge punches through. So we're going to have some fun with this. So let's go ahead and pull up the texture that we need. So we're going to go in and grab, let's go and keep your finger on the T key and left click. And I'm going to go in here and grab a T grunge roughness. So T underscore grunge roughness. We'll use this one. And again, you can use any one that you want. There's another one, which is old sculptsman sitting in unreal for so long. Keep my finger on the T key, left click. This one's actually called T underscore UDK. If you are an old school, unreal person, you'll know UDK was the first free version. And you can use this guy too. The only problem is at the very bottom, there's a clip off here where you have no texture and it's kind of odd. So I don't I just point people to this. I don't necessarily use this all the time. So just wanted to point that out. So you could do that because that's in my example. We're going to move this over here. Now, what we want to do is blend things in such a way that we're grabbing. And you'll notice we have me go full screen for a second. You'll notice we have this input bottom and input top. So they act like material functions, these material attributes here. They actually house the layers as they fall into the parent. And I'll show you how to do that. And it actually acts as gateway so that we can populate these areas. We really don't have to do anything with them. But we're going to have to mess with the alpha. If we want these textures to blend a particular way. So what we're going to have to do is I'm going to pull this down and I'm going to call up a clamp because it just keeps things within a range. Now, you can punch in the numbers, anything that you want. You'll see we're automatically get an error. It doesn't show up in our stats. That's because we don't have anything to climb. So it's like, what are you doing? So I'm kind of doing this a little bit backwards. But we're going to go ahead and populate that. So let's go and move this back for a second. Don't panic if you got an error. I just want to get you started in the right direction. I'm going to pull this texture over. And what we're going to do is hit the M key and left click. That's going to give us our multiply. And then I'm going to go and attend and use a scalar to intensify that. Keep my finger on the S key. Get this here and we'll call this a grunge. Intensity. I'm not going to bother grouping these because you kind of get the idea how to do that. You should know that by now. Just to save a bit of time. And I'm going to go ahead and put this default to one. We can set that to maximum to five if we want to. And keep the minimum zero. I'm going to pull that string right into the B channel. Grab this texture sample, pull it into the A channel there. Now we're going to grab this multiply. And we want to be able to control not only just the intensity, but the contrast. So we're going to go and keep I'm going to go and create a power node. There we go. And this power node allows us and unreal so great with the pro tips. It takes two inputs and raises raises the base to the exponential power. And outputs the result. So it actually gives us a little control here so we can actually almost like a multiply and steroids, you're going to go that way allows us to grab this here as the base. And then exponentially, we can increase that information. So we're going to go to and create a scalar again. There we go. And we're going to make this guy the contrast. Contrast grunge. Awesome. And we'll set that to one. And again, you get the idea for grouping. Typically, I will group things and keep that all set in here. But we'll keep this just generic and grab the power and go right into the clamp. Let's make sure we go all the way. There we go. Bam, it is connected. You'll see the area go away and we should be good to go. Now, again, we have nothing to reference with this blend, so it doesn't know what to do. It's not like these two material layers, which already have the plug in and the previews working like a champ. Cool. So in the next video, we're going to go ahead and create the information that we need for our parent material to bring this all together. Thanks again.",
