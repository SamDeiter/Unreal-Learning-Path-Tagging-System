  "text": " Hello and welcome to this next video. In this we're going to be doing some of the coding. We are going to be jumping into the Find Smart Object task and we're going to be accessing the Smart Object subsystem for the first time. Okay, so the first thing I would like you to do is to come down to the stt underscore find smart object and double click to open it. So here we have it here. As you look at this, you can see that we already have the interstate showing. And that is if you were creating this from scratch, you wouldn't have it. You'd have to get it from the overrides here in the drop down. That because we're trying to make this a bit slicker, I've already dragged it in and added it. I've also created a number of the variables. Bear in mind these variables are in the appropriate categories. So we have context for the character and the AI controller. We have the claim handle or the slot handle for the output. These are so that they can be accessed through the state tree as part of the task and can be populated. So let's see what code we've already got. So if I scroll out and come over to the end here, you can see that we have some code already here. We've got our finished task. And this is required for us to tell the state tree that we have succeeded in this task. But before it, we have a little bit of code that is going to allow us to grab the claim handle and the smart object subsystem and get the slots transform and save it to our AI. Our AI is the BP-MPC Chair Finder. Now, this probably isn't the best modular way of doing this, but we are going to need the transform. Probably use an interface in other instances, but I think this shows what's going on quite well. We're going to need the transform in order to hand it to the motion warping. So that is where we are going to move the mesh using root motion so that it can sit down and perfectly interact with the chair. So warping is going to allow us to move the skeletal mesh and make it so that when it sits down, it actually sits down on the chair. So all this is doing is if we get to this point, we are grabbing the chair finder and saving the transform of the mesh so that it knows where to sit. OK, I am going to jump to the beginning here and go through piece by piece. Now bear in mind, there's always a finished version of the code in the finished version folder. So if you do get stuck, you can jump in and get it. I hope that I encourage you to copy along so that you understand what each of these nodes do. First thing that we want to do is find the smart objects. I'm going to right hand click and we're not going to be able to find the smart object from here because it is a node which is part of the smart object subsystem. So I am going to type in smart object and sub. That will bring me an option to get the smart object subsystem. And once I have that, I can drag off and I can search for find smart objects. We'll be finding multiple in this case and then selecting one at random. So that's the code that I need. We'll need to get the character to plug that into the use actor. This is the actor that's using it. And now the next thing we need to do is make a request. So I'm going to drag off of the request pin and I'm going to type make. And you will see the only one that comes up is the make smart object request. I need to drag off this request pin. And as you can see, as part of this make smart object request, we have two inputs, the query box and the filter. We'll start with the query box. What the query box is going to be is the spatial, so the locational size, which we are going to search for a smart object. And if we look over this, this is of a box structure. So we need to make a box. I'm going to drag off from there. I'm going to type in make. You'll see at the bottom here we have make box. Now for this to be a box, we just need to give it a minimum vector, a maximum vector. However, we need this to be relative to the AI. So this is in world space. I'm going to grab my actor again. And I'm going to get actor location. Drag that in. And for the minimum, I'm going to do is I'm going to minus. I'm going to subtract. And on the subtraction, I'm going to right-hand click on the second input pin. And I'm going to change that to a float double precision. I'll plug that into the minimum. Let's change it. I'll do both of them first. I come up and I'm going to do a plus. And I'm going to add that into the maximum. Well, I'm going to convert both of these to a float. Then I'm going to type in literal. Hello. We'll plug this in to both of the boxes. We could make this a variable. Well, what this is going to do is it's going to allow me to just type in the size of the box. And for this, I'm going to go big. So I am going to put that in 20,000. So we definitely find something. Now, it's very reasonable for that to be a smaller amount. And you could make a variable included in the inputs so that we could change it at the point that we're searching. But this will do for us at the time being. So that gives us our query box. Now, next we have the filter. And for this, I'm going to drive off and type make again. And you see it's detected the pin that I've got. And it's suggesting make smart object request filter. Now, with this, you can see that we have two pins down the left-hand side. User tags and plain priority. I'm actually not going to change either of these, but I do need to do some inputting. So I'm going to do the drop down that we have here. And you can see that we have a number of different options. So, now it's just going to work. Now I have a button that says, It is a change in value for us. It's just to enter under the filter. And we don't have to socket that. So, we'll go ahead and stop the wait. drops down. And now it should work again. classes. So in order to do that, I'm going to drag off, I'm going to do a make array. And for the make array, I'm just going to select the GameplayBehaviourSmartObject definition. That's all we need for the smart object filter. However, do bear in mind that if you did want to make something more advanced, you could make a more complicated filter here in order to create something a bit more complicated. Grab Quartz, bring it up just a little bit. I'll get the smart object just for formatting. So I will drag that up a little bit more. I'm going to try and get it all on screen so I can just leave it there for a second. So this is our first section to find smart objects in the local area. Right, with that done, let me jump on to the next section. Now what we need to do is figure out if we are not getting any smart objects, because we want to return a failed condition if we don't have any smart objects. So this is relatively simple. We've got a return pin here. If I hold down B for Planch, I can connect that up and plug in the condition. And if it is false, we want to finish the task. But we want to finish the task as a fail. Quite straightforward, if we have no object returned at all, then we failed to find our smart object. Now next, we want to mark Slot as claimed and get a name handle. So we have our results here. From this, I am going to write off and I'm going to type in random. So we get a random array item. Now you can see from this, we have a smart object request result structure. I'm going to right-hand click and you can see we have an option to split and struck it in. I'm going to do that because what we need is the Slot handle. So not the smart object handle, but just the specific Slot. We might have multiple Slots on the actor and we want to work with that Slot. So I'm going to now drag off of the Slot handle and type in mark smart object as claimed. So we haven't returned any. So we can now grab this and mark it as claimed. Again, we need a use actor. So I will get my character, drag it over. So you've got a little green line there and that plugs in perfectly. Now the claim handle is actually part of our outputs. Now we have our claim handle. We might as well do the same thing on the other side. So I'm going to drag the claim handle, place it over the output pin, and it will automatically connect it up like this. So we now have grabbed a render, one of the Slots, and we've claimed it and set that claim handle so that it can be as part of an output for this task. And this brings us to our final piece of code. So all we need to do now is connect that up and that's our entire code done and dusted. Now we cannot test this until we've got the other codes and bits of it running. Hopefully that all makes sense. I'm going to save and compile to check that there are no errors. And I'm going to go back to Minup. So thank you very much. That brings us to the end of our first piece of coding. In the next one, we are going to finish off the task that actually runs the behavior.",
