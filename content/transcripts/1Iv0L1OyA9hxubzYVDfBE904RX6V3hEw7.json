  "text": " Lastly, today we'll talk about subsurface materials and parallax control. So here we'll talk about creating a subsurface material, which we'll use jade in this instance. We'll talk about using parallax occlusion mapping with material functions. We'll talk about creating some ice and how you may go about doing that. We'll talk about the subsurface profile in Unreal and then also give you some pro tips to close out here. So there's a few things to consider if we're thinking about creating subsurface materials and in this instance, like we said, we're going to use the example of jade like material. So creating something like jade or even ice, you can make some dependencies to make the material rich with control so you have plenty of control for your artists to really dial in the effects that they're wanting to use. So we set up the material to be a subsurface under the shaded model. So when you have your material open, you want to make sure you're not clicking on any nodes. You can click on the main root node that you can see in the bottom of the image here. But essentially, you'll see this on the details panel in your material. So you just want to change the shading model to subsurface to texturize the effect. Color can be stacked with lerps and multiplies to get the desired results. So that's exactly what you can see here. We've got two color values. We're lerping, which is the linear interpolate between this this noise based texture, which are then multiplying based on the amount that you want. And you're making parameters of all these these properties so that you can dial them in either in your material parameter collection, like you said before, that you saw before, or whether you just want it on a per material instance basis. So the final texture output can have a scalar on it to control the amount of noise filter to use. So this is plugged into the lerp. So you can see the amount of noise here, which is the noise being multiplied. And that this is the point that we're talking about here just before the end end result. If you want to control the opacity of a subsurface material, you can create a Fresnel index and control the exponent there. So you introduce a lerp and a scalar to control the subsurface amount, which is the opacity that is used for the transmission here. And then also you can add a multiply into this lerp B to then multiply the subsurface amount effect. So it can be adjusted with a new input, but can be used as a generic range control in this instance. To add subsurface control, we create a Fresnel node as well again. And then this helps sell the idea of some kind of light affecting the surface. It gives you that that rim light and look. You could create a scalar for the exponent. And in this case, it's controls the edge subsurface control. And then you can also create a scalar for the specular reflection. In this case, it'll give the illusion of thickness. So plug that into the base reflection fraction in. And then you can also plug in a multiply with a const three vector to control the overall color. So a few notes here that when we're adding subsurface control, that the Fresnel that is found under the vector ops is a highly customized version of the Fresnel. So that allows you to affect many different aspects of how the Fresnel is rendered. So you can see the properties here. There's great documentation on this. This image is taken from the documentation. So they allow you to dial in the Fresnel values that you're looking for. This is the Fresnel node. But just to know that it can give more control, but it can lead to artifacts if not set up correctly. So only use Fresnel if you're the regular Fresnel. If this version isn't getting the results that you want. And also if you don't understand some of the properties found there. If we're looking at parallax occlusion mapping. So the parallax occlusion of until function node, we use it to simulate a 3D effect. So it's like a bump offset, but with more visual accuracy. So no real distance limitations. It is expensive. The visualizer will not calculate it correctly. So it will stay green and parent to be safe. So when you're looking at your view render modes and you're looking at how expensive this might be, it appears safe, but it does have a lot of complexity to it. As you can see with the complexity of the material. So material collection is that the shadows and the light source reaction are more realistic at an angle than a bump offset. So it can be, it can save on needed geometry. This sample shows parallax UVs plugged into each text UV for the shift in effect. But you can see the kind of pros and cons of each approach here. Sometimes, especially with the newer features of Unreal Engine, say a Nanite approach, you may just want to add the geometry in there. And especially if you're doing anything with virtual reality, the VR will break any kind of illusion of a bump offset or a parallax occlusion. So again, it depends on the project outcome. You want to weigh up the optimization versus the end visual result for the user or the player or whoever it is that you're creating this project for. But hopefully that gives you an idea about how you might use parallax occlusion mapping inside of your projects. Continuing with the parallax occlusion mapping, Temporal A.A. can be used to jitter the number of rays slightly. It causes traces to be out of phase and cancels out artifacts over time. Shadows can be adjusted manually and might need to be for accuracy and it must be activated in the function. So again, just keeping in mind this performance versus visual fidelity payoff. This approach with the shadowing can be expensive or it will be expensive, shall I say. So the pixel depth offset can also be added for accurate intersections. If other geometries are introduced, the flatter the surface, the better in this instance. And then just a note here before we wrap up. If a height map is introduced, steep maps will have noticeable stretching. So to fix this, you can have a world alignment texture that can be used for tiling options or troubled areas. And then for creating your ice effect, for ice, you can use a world alignment material function that can be introduced to help with subsurface visual matching. The world alignment textures help for textures to be consistent and matching and not based on UVs, but world position for the subsurface. And then with a Fresnel node and a subsurface color, they can be plugged in into that subsurface node. So you can see an example of exactly what we're looking at there. The subsurface profile, which you can get through right clicking in your content browser, going to materials and the subsurface profile is here. So the subsurface scattering profile data is an asset that can be created, shared because it's a data asset and saved in the content browser. So the data is intended to be authored by artists and controls the distance, the light in the subsurface should scatter. It controls the color of the subsurface and also the falloff color of the light once it has exited the object. So the data can then be applied to a subsurface material. And then the subsurface profile data can be tweaked interactively, meaning that you do not need to recompile the material to see the end results. So it's just a nice global way of really dialing in what it is you want to do. And you can add it into the details panel of the material here with the shading model. You can just use a subsurface profile and then add that subsurface profile into here. So it really gives you a nice global feel to what it is you're looking for. And you may have them map specific, for example, to really dial in that visual effect of the subsurface in a given level. So it can be created and loaded into material and also migrated into different projects. If you want to keep reusing your subsurface profiles, has a separate menu, as you can see in the bottom right here, updates without compiling, as we said, and it's still not visually robust with the customization of a parent material. A few pro tips to close out then. So it's best to customize your subsurface material with full control of the properties like you can see here. So you really want to dial in, you want to make sure everything's some kind of parameter that you can really hone in the colors and the values that you're aiming for, as well as any maps that you want to include. Megascans export or plug-in material creation. Transmission effect is not as strong as customizing the subsurface material. And you also want to create as much customization as you can for best control and results for an instant material. So as we usually do at the end of these sections, you can find subsurface profiling documentation here and also just information about how to use subsurface in your Unreal Engine materials at this documentation page here.",
