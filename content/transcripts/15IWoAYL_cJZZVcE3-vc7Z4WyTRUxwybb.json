  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at HLODs and how they work with your levels of detail. So let's get started. So HLODs you may ask, what exactly are they? Well they're a hierarchical level of detail. It's a way to combine pre-existing set of mesh actors into a single HLOD proxy mesh and material with atlas textures. So using HLOD may lead to increased performances as they reduce draw calls down to one call per proxy mesh, which is pretty convenient. When generating HLOD proxy meshes, there are several parameters you can adjust, which help define how static mesh actors are grouped together as clusters that will ultimately be built into proxy meshes. Now you don't have to use this tool, but it is available. It's a little bit more on the old school side, and you may find that Nanite fits the bill just fine. But to be able to create it, you do want to start out by going into your proxy meshes. You can find them under your world settings. So these proxy meshes are created from clusters of static meshes, like we mentioned. Each cluster is going to be one draw call. That's the benefit you get from this. Clusters can't be merged into bigger clusters at a greater distance. So useful for wide shots or open worlds. Note, HLOD layers can now be used to house geo also with world partition. So you can use them with world partition also. But I want to put a note here for world partition. If you decide to use it with your team, keep in mind there are still some things evolving with it, such as linking your world partition updates with per force. There can be some workarounds that you may have to tackle in that. We're not going to cover that here, but I want you to be aware of it. So creating it, we're going to go to our world settings and load hierarchical LOD setup. We're going to generate a single cluster if needed. And this can be set to HLOD out in the HLOD outliner also, which we'll take a look at in just a bit. We're going to pop into Unreal and take a quick look too. From there, you want to open your hierarchical LOD outliner and select the HLOD setup asset. And that can be default. So you don't necessarily have to do any heavy lifting on this particular case. We did have an older version if you were used to it, where HLOD would list a lot more options than it does now. It's been pared down quite a bit, but you want to generate your clusters. And when you generate your clusters, you're going to be able to get the items that you need. Now if the actor is changing anyway, it's going to prompt you. It'll tell you, hey, man, you need to generate those proxy meshes again, because that's kind of important things have changed. To update the HLOD cluster, only use build all if you have to, as it can dirty your scene and Unruh will let you know. He'll say, hey, buddy, are you sure about this? This may not be the right choice for you. We're going to actually look at a HLOD volume also in place with an HLOD in my scene that I've given to you. Let's go ahead and jump into Unreal and look at the setup I have, as well as look at the HLOD outliner breakdown that shows some of the things that have been generated and some overall sweeping control that you got in your scene. In Unreal, I'm going to go to my beach HLOD sample. So let's go and click on that. I'm going to say don't save what we were doing. Get that to come up. And we'll see it generate get in there. Now let's go and take a look at things overall. Now let's open up our HLOD outliner. Let me pull it over. And you see that I have generated some HLOD objects in here. We have a LOD actor here that has all the parts for that particular probe. We have another one in here. And Unreal's clustering these. So let me know what has become an HLOD object. Now, any time you don't want these in here, you can delete that cluster. You're like, hey, I don't really need this one. This one's fine. Nanite's handling it just fine. I can go ahead and delete that. You can also, as we go and open these up, look at these on an individual level. And you'll see there's advanced settings here. And it just kind of shows you the transform options. It isn't as robust as it used to be. Or we used to have a bit more where you have a little bit more material control and a few other things. Those don't quite pop up like they used to. So things have been pretty pared down here. You'll notice at the bottom here, we have a yellow message here. It says, Actors represented in the HLOD have changed. Generate proxy meshes to update. So since I've tweaked with this file a bit, I would have to just generate another proxy meshes here for any updates or changes that I've made. So keep that in mind. And again, build all you kind of want to avoid if you don't really have to do it. And there's also regenerates your clusters, but no proxy meshes for meshes in the level. So this is your initial button that you would click. And then from there, any changes you can do for your generated proxy meshes are found here. Now, another thing I want to point out, there's a thing called an HLOD volume. You type in volume here. There's a lot here. You'll see that I've drug in an HLOD proxy volume. This actually acts as a container to hold a cluster of HLODs that we have built in. So I can actually use this as a priority area until Unreal to read a group of pieces of geometry as one draw call. And you'll see this HLOD volume here. And this actually works pretty well. This HLOD volume, you'll see, also has a few more options. It tells you to include overlapping actors. So I can definitely kick that box on. There are a few that are overlapping a bit in my scene. We have a few generic brush settings in here, but we also have include actor in HLOD. So it's going to you want to make sure that's turned on. There's some advance with the brush settings, but it's nothing to write home about. But overall, you can see how things work. Now, down below, you will see a level instancing. We're not doing that in this particular case. Level instancing allows you to grab maybe a group of rocks, these particular ones. And if I wanted to, I can turn them into a level instance actor. But in this case, we're not covering that in this particular class. It's a little bit more building of your game world. But from here, we're mainly going to be focusing on our HLODs. I just wanted to point that out if you're wondering what that does. This basically allows you to have instanced pieces of large. Say you have a huge open world area and there's rock formations and large scapes, landscapes and just things that you've kind of mushed together. And you have all these pieces of geometry to manage them. You can actually create a level instance to make things a little bit lighter. And Unreal will instance those pieces of geometry as an instance part of your level and make thing. It makes things a little bit more organized and categorized and reading the geometry smoother so that your big world that you've created doesn't become too much of a bog in your scene. So here again, we have an HLOD volume. And again, it is calculating everything in my scene the way that I want. And if we did a comparable like we just talked about, I could grab this pieces of geometry here, right click and you'll see level and I can create an instance level if I wanted to. And in there I can have living and HLOD if I wanted. And then it would simply be able to be loaded in here. Now there's a difference when you're working with those. We're working in our levels here. If I was working in a world partition, I would not be working in levels. So there's a give and take situation there. And we do have a class talking about that, in which one of my colleagues really breaks it down a bit easier for you. But I just wanted to explain if there's any confusion about how that system works. So to break it down even further, they are used by the hierarchical level of detail HLOD system to group actors into a single HLOD cluster. So again, like I said before, it puts them in a cluster when generating clusters. The Unreal Engine will override its normal generation process in difference to manually placed volume. So basically going to look at them as a priority area, like I mentioned before. That's it with this lesson. Here's a few links here that allow you to dive in a bit deeper on these topics. In the next section, we're going to take a look at texture and material optimization.",
