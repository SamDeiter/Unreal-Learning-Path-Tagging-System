  "text": " Okay, so before we get started with absolutely anything, I think it's worth going over some real-time material concepts. So the stuff that we're going to be taking a look at today, what are materials inside of Unreal? And then what is PBR? PBR is standard for physically based rendering. What is a material? Essentially inside of Unreal, it's an asset type that you apply to a mesh that controls the way it looks. In its simplest form, I think you can think of it as the paint that you apply over a mesh, and you could control various properties of it, such as the color, the finish, how rough or shiny it is, that kind of thing. And importantly, a material defines how light interacts with the surface it's applied to. So for example, as you've got in this illustration down here, where the surface is like really nice and smooth, which means that light would bounce right off it and create a reflection. Or whether it's got so many microscopic imperfections that it becomes a rougher surface, and when light hits, it scatters around in multiple different directions, you don't get a clear reflection out of it, and you have more of a matte look to your object. So that's essentially materials inside of Unreal. Now, materials need to be looked at within the context of physically based rendering, or PBR. So what is PBR? It's a unified light and shading system. That's the most important thing. It's not so much a particular thing about materials, but that is more of this concept, this idea of a bunch of things working together, namely materials, lighting, and the exposure in the scene. So why use physically based rendering? Essentially it gives you a more intuitive and consistent set of rules that you can follow to understand what you're going to get out of the inputs that you're putting in. And the good thing about it is that it's physically accurate, meaning that you can use real world counterparts and measurements to essentially make a digital counterpart. And importantly, as I said before, PBR is a combination of materials, light, and exposure. It's not just the thing about materials. It's a more general concept. So I think with these real time concepts, we can start getting into more specifics about Unreal, and eventually we'll start looking at the editor itself. But I think we can move on to the next step.",
