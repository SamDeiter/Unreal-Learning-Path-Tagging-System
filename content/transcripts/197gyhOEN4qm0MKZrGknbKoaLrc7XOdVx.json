  "text": " Alright, now that we've introduced you to ways of setting up your fingers, we're going to look at an alternate setup for the fingers using the Get Children for each and the Parent Constraint nodes. So let's get started. So we're going to be exploring an alternate setup as mentioned earlier by using several different types of nodes versus building the function as we did earlier. So we're going to hop into the engine and take a look at what we're going to do and how to build that. So let's go ahead and hop in there right now. We'll take a look at this project. So make sure you're on the number three alternate fingers setup. You'll notice again there are two. There's one that's empty and another one that is done. So if we take a look at the Ctrl Alt fingers done, we'll see this method of nodes are all mapped out together and this is what we are going to be building today. So it's not a lot of nodes, but they are newer and so we wanted to introduce those to you right now. Now where we're going to start again, make sure that you have clicked on the CR Alt fingers in the number three and you'll see that most of this is already set up from the previous one. So we have an active control rig. The finger controls are in place and already attached. So we are going to be rather attaching it with the newer nodes. So let's go ahead and get started on that. So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a sequence because we're not going to tag it onto the end of this like we typically have been doing. This will just give us a little bit more functionality and keeping our nodes clean as opposed to a long stretch of different nodes. So go ahead and create a sequence. You press and hold the S while you click and you will get a sequence. So again, just hold the S key as in Sam and then left click and you'll get the sequence node. And we're going to create a children node. Just go ahead and type in children. And we'll look for this get children node. We're going to go ahead and duplicate this as well. We're not going to hook up anything up. We're just going to get these nodes in here and explain a little bit about those. So you can just hit control D and you'll duplicate that. It's going to place them here for now. You're going to clean them up and bring them down a little farther. Go ahead. And then we're going to set these names to these bones because we do want the bones, the controls. We're going to look for the hand R and the hand, the hand underscore R. And the IKs, make sure you select the correct one. Zoom in a little bit more so you can see. And we're going to do the hand right or I'm sorry, hand left in this case. It's going to that one right there. And we're good to go for that. Now make sure you check recursive on. If I leave this up, it'll explain a little bit what that is. That just basically means it's going to grab everything. For the provided items. So it's not just going to be the hand out. It's going to be all of the items there. And we don't want to include the hand out as part of this because that's not what it is. It's just for the fingers. So everything below the hand out and hand R will be selective. So that's what that means. And we're going to make sure that the type is searching for bone and select that. This makes sure that we are going to be reiterating or iterating through the bones themselves and not everything. So that will get us down to that part. All right. So let's move to the next step. Now we want to do the looping through to hook up the fingers themselves to the controls. So for each nodes loops through a collection of array elements. In our case, the finger joints under each hand joint. Remember, we didn't select the hand joint itself and then it performs an operation on each. So the append know that we're going to be adding connects the arrays into a single input and be fed into for each nodes array pin. Now, if you drag from the pins, blue stack, the array pin, you'll get the proper for each connection. Otherwise, the array element pin will be purple, which won't connect. Let's do that right now. Right. So back in the engine here, let's go ahead and drag off, as I said, and append. There's our pin node and we're going to disconnect this pin with the alt click and drag this to the array here. And we'll drag this one and to the other. So you should have something set up a little bit like so. The next thing we want to do is track it over here and we're going to do the for each. I'm going to grab this. Spell it correctly. And then we're going to connect this array to this array. So it will be feeding all of these both from the left and the right into what the appendings going to do and feed it right into this for each. All right, we're going to finish up the connection here and we're going to use what's called a parent constraint, which is used quite extensively and control. Now, we could set rotation here. However, the parent constraint note works better because it does a lot of work. It works better because it does avoid some of those flipping issues on the left hand. Go ahead and create a parent constraint, dragging off from the for each for parent constraint right there. It's the one we want. And then the next thing we want to do is we want to add the element. Now, typically you could open the carrot up and you could get access to all these different things. But right now we just need the element hooked up to the child. And we'll need to tell it the name, so we are going to go ahead and open this up to reveal the name. And we're going to go ahead and add something to this, because otherwise it's not going to name it exactly how we're going to want it. So we're going to want to add a control name underneath that. So let's go ahead and pull up a concatenate node. And then we're going to type in here underscore, or whatever you want to know, but just denote it as the name that you want for a control, which we've been using control underscore control. And I are going to head and get this right here into this name. Rather extra, we're going to open up a few more fields before we do that. So what we want to do is we want to click this under parents and we want to look for the name. So click this open and we're going to look for the name. Right there, a little hidden, but you have to open it up in order to see that. So it's zooming a little bit more so you can see what we have here. And we're going to make sure that we change this to control. We don't want it to be the bone. We want to name it as a control. So it'll attach this and everything looks set up. So we want to make sure all the connections are available. Well, notice there isn't a connection here. Now, this is where the sequence is going to come in handy. So I'm going to drag this connection, the exact to there and connect the A to our original setup. Here's where the B is going to be connected all the way into this append. Right. And we hit compile. Hopefully, fingers don't go flying off anywhere. Let's go ahead and take a look and test this. I'm going to grab my thumbs, which I typically am doing. I'm going to see if it moves. And there we go. Excellent. So that is the complete setup for using an alternate way opposed to the function that we built earlier. Yet another way of using multiple types of nodes and introducing you to a whole lead of tools that are at your disposal within control rig. So now we're going to move on to the next thing. We're going to be working with nulls in order to build an extra head control on top of the head aim that we had built prior. This guy right here. All right. So let's get started.",
