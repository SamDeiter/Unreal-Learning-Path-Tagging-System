  "text": " So now that we've covered those kind of under the hood fundamentals that go into making a project even open in the first place, it's worth going into a little bit more of the kind of gameplay side, the kind of fundamental Lego bricks that go into making the kind of gameplay functionality. So everything really fundamentally leads back to UObject like we spoke about before. It's important to bear in mind that when we're talking about just a raw UObject, these things have no representation in the world, they have no collision, they have no position, they're just data. That data can be updated at runtime, it's not plain old data, but it is just a kind of data object. They have no inbuilt tick functionality, they have no concept of a world that they exist in, they have no way to tick. Tick is Unreal's version of an update function, something that runs once per frame. Whenever you're spawning a UObject, you have to be provided with some kind of outer, which is the object it lives within. If you don't provide it with an outer, it will default to the transient package, and transient like the UProperty markup means that this object is kind of regarded as temporary and won't be saved. It's important to highlight that UObjects can support networking, but it does require some additional setup. So if you're thinking about data needing to get replicated over a network, you can do it through UObject, but it's worth questioning whether or not there might be a better way, a more streamlined and easier to implement with the engine way of doing that. UObject isn't always the first thing you should be thinking of when you're thinking about network replication. Just to kind of give an example of what a UObject might be in a typical game situation, if we have an example of an explosive barrel, and that explosive barrel will exist in the world, it will be an actor, which we'll get to in a moment, and it will have some components on it, which we'll also get to in a moment. But maybe the way we store, and this barrel can explode, and the way we store that data about what the explosion is, that might be the kind of thing we do through a UObject. So just through some editing magic, I've jumped ahead and kind of created an example of this explosive barrel that we can kind of look at. So just jumping into this explosion data asset, this is what that might look like. So UDataAsset extends from a UObject, as we can see here, and you can see we've got the markup that we need U before because we're still in that UObject part of the hierarchy. So this is a data asset, and here we've implemented the particle that this explosion should use when it fires, the sound effect that it plays, and the kind of radius. So this is some example of what a UObject might look like in your game. And then moving on, we have an actor. This is the kind of fundamental building block that you see in the level. So unlike UObjects, these do exist in the level. They can have positions, they can have collisions, they can have a visual representation. And it's worth mentioning that whenever you're in an editor, a really easy way to tell if something is an actor is if it appears in this section on the right here, the world outliner. It's not to say 100% of actors displayed here. There are one or two that are hidden away, but for the most part, other than the folders here, anything that is in this list is going to be an actor. It's just kind of a good rule of thumb. So yeah, unlike UObjects where they require a bit of manual setup, it's much easier to get that kind of client-server network communication working on an actor. It's set up for that kind of thing. It's set up for RPCs. It's set up for variable replication, data replication in that way. And the other thing to highlight is that actors can inject their own behavior. Importantly, that's something that distinguishes Unreal from other proprietary software that you may have used. Actors can have their own opinion about how code should work, but they do also implement this component architecture, which allows us to bring functionality in from other places and make it a little bit more portable, which we'll get into in a moment. So an example of an actor might be an A Explosive Barrel. Again, note the A because now we are in the actor element of the hierarchy. So just jumping back into our code, we have our Exploding Barrel actor. This is just a quick example that I made. We can see this Exploding Barrel has the A in the class definition, but not actually in the file name. It inherits from actor and we can see what an actor might look like. We'll talk about components in a moment, but you can see this actor has several components within it. It implements its own behavior, so it is not just subject to the functionality of the components. It can have its own data and functions. So just here, what I've said is that if we jump into this definition, when this Explosive Barrel takes damage, then it causes, it makes its explosion component explode. So we'll go into more detail about that in a second. This is just a really small example of what an actor might look like. We can also actually jump quickly into our engine to show a useful flow for when thinking about putting things in C++ or Blueprint. In our example scene I've got here, I've got two of my amazing Exploding Barrel assets. The way I've actually created this is we have this initial class here in C++. This is where we define all the fundamental functionality. So we've said it has these components in it, it's got this data in it, it's got this functionality. We override this functionality from the base class. But once you're at the level of dealing with content, and this will be dealt with in more detail in other sessions, but once you're at the level of dealing with content, it's kind of better to do that in Blueprint. So what I've actually done here, and this is a typical workflow, is that I've defined all the base behavior in C++, and then at the level that I've got something that's actually dealing with content like meshes and actual sound effects and things like that, I've made a Blueprint that inherits from our Exploding Barrel class, and I've made BP Exploding Barrel. Worth noting as well that the BP underscore is just a typical naming convention, it is not hard coded as a requirement unlike the C++ A and U notation. And you can see here on the Barrel mesh I've just specified that it's going to have a cylinder mesh and it's using a default material and things like that. So this is the kind of typical workflow that you might have once you've got Actors or really anything that's using content, is you have the base class in C++ and you actually reference the content via a Blueprint. And that'll be explained more another time why that's particularly useful. And then finally, our kind of last component, no pun intended, of this workflow is the component itself. So when we talk about components we're not talking about an ECS architecture for bringing all your data and having it together in one place for quick referencing for your CPU. That's something distinct. Unreal does have an implementation for that called Mass, but what we're talking about something slightly distinct that is more in common with the idea of entities and components in terms of other engines such as Unity, where we have an entity, in this case the Actor, that represents the object in world and components as interchangeable modular bits that can bring extra functionality. So yeah, they bring reusable functionality and we can add them and remove them even at runtime. Components, Actor components are importantly called Actor components because they rely on an Actor to exist. We cannot have a component without an Actor. All components need to be attached to an Actor and then they can reference that Actor if required, which we'll jump in, I'll give an example of that in a second. The other thing is that we have availability to expose functionality and expose variables just like on an Actor to our blueprints, meaning we can make, as well as the components bringing this modularity inherently, we can also edit components in different situations to use the same component but provide different data to it. So if I were to give an example of what a component might look like, here's another example, again using this same explosive barrel, the actual explosion that this barrel does is handled by a component and that means it's inherently reusable so not only barrels can explode now, now I can put this explosion component on other things and you can see we've used this explosion data asset here and our actual explode functionality is handled inside our component which basically just reads data from our explosion asset, it says OK does it have a particle system, then spawn that particle, if it has a sound play that sound and then just do a little world query to find all Actors within the radius specified by the data again and damage those Actors and what that leads to is something vaguely explosion like where it damages, does a particle, does a sound effect and damages things in a radius, right? And just to kind of demonstrate that behaviour actually working, so you don't need to worry about the actual blueprint functionality here but just to quickly show what I'm doing, when the level starts after a one second delay I'm just damaging one of these barrels but what you'll see is that because of the way the component works it damages everything around it and actually both of the barrels are going to explode even though I'm only actually damaging one of them. So not exactly the most impressive sound effect, not the best visuals but I was just working with premade editor assets but you can see then that that functionality clearly works and what it means again is that we've got that added level of portability that you know I've got explosive barrels now and now I can add that explosion functionality to grenades or whatever else that I want. The last component of this, again no pun intended, the last element of this is scene components which we have already been demonstrating but not explicitly. Scene components inherit from actor components so they are actor components but they're a very common and important distinction. Where as raw actor components are there to provide functionality, scene components exist within the world and you can actually see these two things are separated in an actor and I'll display that in a second. Actor components are maintained in a separate list to your scene components and scene components provide anything that you would need some kind of world representation so it can just be a location, it can be collision, it can be visuals. Scene components can also be attached to bones and sockets which makes them very useful for anything that needs to be related to players, something they might need to be holding like a knife mesh or something like that or a hat, very very common one and yeah they can also be used to detect collisions so components can overlap with other components for any collision behavior that you need. Just to kind of quickly demonstrate some of the stuff I've been talking about, if we look here we'll see we have a barrel mesh component, this is not a component that I've written myself, this is a static mesh component, it's a component that exists just in Unreal by default and you can see our actor has split these two sets of components up. We have my explosion component which has no location data, it's kind of just abstract and it just provides the functionality of blowing up and then we have our scene components which are maintained in this kind of hierarchy that would be similar maybe to any DCC packages that you're used to, DCC packages that you're used to working with where we have kind of a hierarchy. It's important to highlight that when we're dealing with scene components, at least at the blueprint level, every actor must have at least one scene component and it's that component that provides an actor with its location and rotation. So when we have a, when we ask an actor about its location and rotation, actually what we're doing is we're saying the location and rotation of its root component. A typical workflow might be that you have what's called a scene root which is just a blank scene component with no extra data in it, it's basically just a position as an object's kind of pivot and then you attach other things to it and that makes it very easy to do things like by default this barrel would actually be positioned here and then you would see all our barrels would be halfway through the floor. So we can use that scene root as a kind of, we can offset from that and because our mesh is a scene component itself, it has its own location, rotation and scale so we can move it independently of this root component.",
