  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on navigation invokers. So what is a navigation invoker? A navigation invoker generates a navigation mesh with the data on the fly around the actor, which the component is attached to. These are fantastic for dynamically generated worlds or anywhere where it's too large to maintain a nav mesh for the entire world. It's great for open world games and it will just create a nav mesh around the specific actor, which has this component on it. Usually a pawn. So let's go into the engine and have a look at how you would go about setting these up. All right, so here we are back in the engine. So if you want to set up navigation invokers, there's a couple of things that you need to do. So the first thing is I have an open world here and I have added a nav mesh pounds volume. OK, so that is going to still define where the nav mesh is created. If you don't have this, there will be no nav mesh created. So you can go away and then just add it to the entire world and it won't create a nav mesh for the entire world. It'll only create it at runtime dynamically around an invoker. So feel free to make this big. Now, what we need next is to change some of the project settings. So within navigation in the project settings, the two things that you're looking for is first of all runtime generation. So under here we have nav mesh runtime generation has to be dynamic. We're going to be building this at runtime quite a lot. So make sure that this is set to dynamic. Next up, we have to set the generate navigation only around the navigation in focus. So those are the two settings that you have to change. You have to make sure the runtime generation is set to dynamic and that generating navigation only around the invoker is changing. Navigation only around the invoker is checked. And once this is done, if you press the P key, you're not going to see anything anymore. So we're going to be able to unable to actually see when this is generated. Now, that means that we're going to have to jump into the engine to see this running. But we need to do one more thing. And that is any actor that you want navigation to be generated around, you have to add in a component. So here I have our BP top down character and I am going to add a nav navigation invoker. Here we see this and that's going to add it to our character. And from this, I'm going to change some of the settings. So this navigation section here is important because it's going to do a couple of different things. The first thing is he's going to get us to define how far away we want to generate the tiles up to and how far away a tile needs to be before it is removed from the generation. So you'll always want the the removal radius to be bigger than the generation radius. And depending on your tile sizes, I'd make it relatively large. OK, so by default is set to three thousand and five thousand. This is a bit big for our needs because we're not going to be able to see it relatively easily. So I'm going to cut this down to five hundred and the removal at about one thousand. Now, under this, we have supported agents and this is going to reflect the agents which you've created within the project settings. But what is important is you're going to generate the navmesh for any of these which are here. So standardly, you really want to untick any which are not relevant to the porn that you're using. There are some other different cases. Sometimes you might want to use another major navigation invoker on some other kind of actor and you might want to have all of the supported agents. But because we're doing this around our character and we know this character is going to fall into the default agent, I can untick the wide. I'll leave it ticked for the moment just so that we can we can see see that it creates this. Okay, so that's up and running. Now I'm going to jump back into the engine and I'm going to push play and I'm going to push tilde and then I'm going to type in show navigation. And that's going to bring up the navigation mesh. And you'll see here if I click off this navigation mesh, the character cannot figure out the pathfinding. However, if I click on it, it can move and the navigation mesh is going to update as I get closer. I've set this to quite a small number so that we can see it functioning. Now, you'll see at the moment that I can't see the navmeshes which are coming up. So if I go to the navigation mesh, I can see that the character is not going to be able to navigate. So if I jump in and find our recast, select wide and in the details panel, I'm going to tick so that it is drawn. Where is that? So enable drawing. And you can see that both of these navmeshes are getting drawn. So at any point where I'm running this, this is going to have to build two navmeshes and one of them is never going to be used. So that is just wasted wasted time. However, if I untick the wide and run the game again. And again, do show navigation. And enable drawing. You can see that it's now no longer created it. So it is important, especially if you're placing this on the pawn, that you limit the navigation generation to just that pawn. If you had a second creature, which was large and fit in a different agent, you would set that navmesh to generate as wider. And it would generate its own navmesh, even if they overlap. So that is Navigation Invokers. Usually it's set them to a larger size, but very useful for larger worlds where you don't want to have to manage a very large navmesh. Thank you very much.",
