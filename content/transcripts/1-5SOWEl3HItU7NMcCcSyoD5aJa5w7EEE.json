  "text": " We're now going to take a look at creating groom materials as there are a few things we need to make sure that we do in order to have the best looking grooms possible. Now with the standard material editor, we can create all types of different looking grooms. And here's an example of that. We've got a red one and a brown one. We can create purple and green and all types of great looking grooms. Now when we are creating material, there are a few things that we need to have enabled to make sure that it renders correctly. First off, our shading model is going to need to be set to hair. We're also going to want to enable the two-sided option to ensure that we can see the groom from every angle. If you are experiencing some issues, make sure that under the usage used with hair strands is enabled. This is needed in order for the material to render correctly. Now this should be set automatically when the shading model is set to hair. However, just make sure that it was enabled here if you're having some issues. Now inside of the material, you can make a material that's just simply a color plugged right into the base color or there is the hair attributes material node. This allows you to access various attributes from your hair. In this case, in this material, we're accessing the hue and the seed. The seed is a random value here and the hue is the longer strands inside of our groom. And we are using those to color our hair in different ways. Now inside of Unreal, let's take a look at how we can do this. The first thing is we're going to right click and go material. We're going to call this M-A-T underscore hair and then double click on it to open it up. Now, again, we do want to make sure that we have our shading model here set to hair and that we enable two-sided. And I'm also going to look up the hair attributes here. So what with this node, what we're going to do here is I'm going to right click and look for a vector. We're going to look for a vector parameter here. Vector and then let's see, vector. Where is the vector parameter? There we go. We're going to just call this hair. And we're going to give it a default value of like some color like that. All right. So what we're going to do with this here, we're going to hold down the M key. We're going to multiply the U value here by this. And what that's going to do is it's going to give us a little bit of variation here in our hair. So I'm just going to move this over real quick and we're going to double click on our hair here, which opened up. I'm just going to pull it over so we can see this. And then right here in our element is zero. We are going to make sure that we have our hair selected and we're going to put that right there. That is going to change our hair. So, again, we can see here that we by using this U and I'll bring this back on screen here by using this U, we're getting some values here. And if I was to change this to the V, click apply here, you'll see that we'll get the opposite of that. So there we go. So we're getting some of those other values. And then you can see here the tips. We're getting a white value. So, again, the purpose of the hair attributes node is to allow us some ability to adjust various parameters or attributes set to the hair so that we can get more variety when we're using it. One of the other ones I like to use here is seed. If I was to do that here, we can see kind of like some more more random bits for the hair. It's really some more random colors. So, again, there's a lot of really interesting things that we can do with our hair using the hair material attributes node or just by simply plugging in options to the base color and the roughness inside of our material.",
