  "text": " Welcome everybody to this Animation Alimbic Importing and Live Link and Real Training. We are going to cover a couple of different topics today, but what they all have in common is that they are all methods of enriching the possibilities of what you can achieve within the engine by connecting it to an external 3D package, like for example Maya or Blender. Whether to cover any particular external simulation needs or to get a direct link between external software or hardware to accelerate your pipeline, Unreal Engine is the type of open software that loves to play nice with other applications. These are the topics that we are going to cover in this class. Let's take a minute to review the course. We are going to start reviewing the Alimbic Format Pipeline from Maya into Unreal. After that, we are going to cover the Maya Live Link and the Maya ART Rigging and Animation tool. Later, we are going to showcase the Blender tools to export models and animations seamlessly into Unreal. In the same fashion, we are going to go over all the possibilities that the Datasmith plugins offer to import to the engine complete scenes from different architectural and design software. And we are going to end up reviewing the Cinematic Pipeline Breakdown Inside Engine with Unreal Sequencer Non-Linear Editor tool. Alimbic is the quintessential non-volumetric vertex and point cloud file format to transfer deformation animations between 3D software, and is widely used in the VFX industry as the end of the line for all animations as they are caged to ensure a light and consistent result in the final render. Unreal Engine has been improving its Alimbic support more and more with each version. And while it's still an experimental feature, the Alimbic File Importer is becoming not only a viable alternative to FBX to ingest 3D models, but a solid way for importing animations and especially deformation animations via Alimbic Cage. Even when we are going to make our practical workshop exporting Alimbic files from Maya, all the settings can be relevant to other 3D packages and so the import options inside the engine. Let's start by defining that the Alimbic support in Unreal comes in the form of a plugin that is installed by default in Unreal Engine. To get access to the .abc file type in the drop-down list in the import options, we must first enable the plugin. There are currently two Alimbic plugins available to enable in the built-in plugin list, the Alimbic Importer and the Alimbic Groom Importer. The second one is just for importing Alimbic hair curves into the engine from 3D software capable of hair grooming. For the purpose of this class, we are not going to cover the hair groom importing, so enabling the Alimbic Importer and restarting the engine as prompt will do the trick. Just as a reminder, Alimbic is going to work best for cinematic video renders and mainly for deformation animation purposes. Even though it is possible to import 3D models and skeletal mesh animations, the FBX pipeline is best suited for those needs. Now let's put hands-on into exporting and importing Alimbic files from Maya to Unreal. In Maya, Alimbic file exporting and importing is also a plugin in its own. That's why we are going to need to check that it is enabled before we continue. Different to other type of file format pipeline capabilities, in Maya all the Alimbic IO is performed in its own menu tab. From there, we will be able to export the selected mesh or the whole scene. There are many attributes that can be exported through Alimbic, although there is just a few that can be exported through real support. Among them are UVs and materials, but be aware that Unreal doesn't have any type of catmold surface smoothing and UVs created from smoothed shapes may differ from the non-smoothed ones and UV issues can arise. Materials will be imported from the geocache as face mask. No proper material attributes or shading information will be exported. There are three Alimbic import types in Unreal, static, skeletal, and geometry cage. And depending on the content of the source Alimbic, you must learn to use one or another depending on their advantages. Static mesh should be the less common. With this import type, you can import an individual or group of meshes as an static mesh. And if it is an animated Alimbic cage, then you can select the frame to be imported. You should be able to import all meshes combined with their original position or at the root with their own pivots depending on the propagate matrix transformation settings. FBX is preferred for this type of mesh ingestion, as much more features are supported, as material parameters, mesh mood, normals, and tangents. Then there is the skeletal mesh import type. This is the most recommended, as it will perform very optimal and natively because it will be imported as a skeletal mesh. This is by no means a way to import skeletons or hierarchical bone animations. It's just a convenient way because skeletal meshes inside Unreal are the only type of mesh that can import morph target deformations. And that is what it does with the Alimbic cage. It will create a morph for every frame and an animated file with the mixing of those morph from frame to frame. The only downside is that the vertex count should be the same through all the animation. So it will be perfect for cloth animations but not suitable for fluid animations with splashes and droplets separating from the main water body. Lastly, there is the geometric cage import type. This is the way to go to import simulations that depends on different count of vertex or vertex order in each frame. The only downside is that because it is comprised of a geometric sequence where the mesh changes every frame, whether the vertex count changes or not, it is the heaviest and much less optimized way of playback. As well as the inherent lack of real-time motion blur because of the lack of interpolation from one mesh to another because there are different meshes. Although temporal sampling in Movie Render Queue should be able to manage a nice motion blur at render time. There are a couple of disadvantages compared to the FBX pipeline. And the most apparent is that no material information will be imported with the Alimbic file. The definition of the face selections in the face sets will be defined and an empty material will be created at import time but no real attributes nor texture should accompany. Although it will be able to search for ready-made material if the name coincide with the one on the file. There is support for normals and smooth groups where it varies from software to software. You should do extensive tests to get to know the limits of your preferred software and so design your own pipeline. Depending on the type of import that we use for the limbic cage files, we will need a different way to play them inside the editor. For example, after import with the skeletal import type, the asset will consist of an skeletal mesh and an animation sequence that can be easily integrated into Sequencer or fire up from an animation blueprint. In the case of the Geometry Cage type is a little bit different as it will be imported as a Geometry Cage asset, a very unique type of asset, it has its own play and stop properties on the detail panel along with other useful attributes. This one with a little bit of work we are going to be able to make it run from a regular blueprint or from the Sequencer. We are going to see all these in much much detail in a second when we jump into the engine.",
