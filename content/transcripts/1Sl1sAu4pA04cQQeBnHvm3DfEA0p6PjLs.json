  "text": " Now that we know a little bit more about Niagara, let's talk about going from Cascade to Niagara. Now Cascade is the tool that is currently used inside of Unreal Engine 4 to create a number of effects across a wide range of platform. Both new and seasoned Unreal Engine developers could possibly have used different versions of a Cascade across various versions of Unreal as this tool has been in use for a little over 10 years. However, because it's been in use for such a long time, it has a few inherent issues. Cascade systems are made up of a collection of Cascade Admitters and Modules. And with the current setup of Cascade, sharing and working within a team environment can be difficult. This is because Cascade Admitters are hard to share and the modules inside of those Admitters cannot be shared and are also very hard to modify. In fact, if you want to modify any of the parameters, such as the required spawn, lifetime or initial size, you would need to involve a C++ programmer and also take on the additional burden of now requiring a custom build of the Unreal Engine. Because of this, Niagara was built to not only be easy to share, but also easy to modify. As you'll see, Niagara systems are composed of Niagara Admitters, which themselves are actually built up of Niagara Module scripts and Niagara Parameter Collections. At any time, an artist, designer or programmer can open up either a Niagara Parameter, a Niagara Module or a Niagara Emitter and look at the contents and make modifications without requiring any type of custom C++ code or code modifications. The other added benefit of this, again, is that Niagara Admitters and the associated modules are easy to share. Niagara Admitters can now be set up similar to how Unreal's Material System can set up material instances in order to speed up production and help ensure uniformity across material creation. You can do the same thing with Niagara Admitters. Artists could now select from a wide range of Niagara Admitters or Niagara Modules and use those to mix and match and adjust parameters to create their effects. This frees up the artists and designers from having to do a lot of prep work in order to start actually creating and instead get right to trying to bring their vision to life.",
