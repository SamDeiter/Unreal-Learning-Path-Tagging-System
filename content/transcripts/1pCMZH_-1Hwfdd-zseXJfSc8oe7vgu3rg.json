  "text": " Let's begin with Uwidget. This is essentially the entry point to Unreal Motion Graphics. What exactly is it? Unreal UMG is essentially a wrapper for Slate. Slate is the kind of under the hood UI elements as written in C++. Slate is a kind of C++ language. It's a little bit more verbose. It looks a little bit weird to anyone who's spent any time reading through it. It's got quite a lot of specific terminology and strange macros and setup. None of this stuff is super scary once you really start digging into it, but it can be a little bit confusing and off-putting the first time you look at it. But UMG is essentially the kind of user-friendly wrapper around that. It's the layer that sits on top of Slate and gives us the blueprint-friendly visual authoring tools for editing what would otherwise be quite verbose. Certainly not easy to visually parse C++ that actually defines how all the visuals are going to be laid out and how they're going to react to various input and things like that. So our starting point when talking about UMG is the Uwidget. This is essentially like the U object of the widget world. It's the base implementation of a widget in native. It's based from U Visual, so it doesn't inherit directly from U Object. It is actually U Visual. U Visual, just worth very, very briefly mentioning, is the superclass because within widgets there's this concept of slots. There are a specific subcategory of widgets which are called panel widgets which are widgets that can have multiple children within them. It might be something like a horizontal box or a vertical box. These would contain within them this idea of slots, so things that other widgets can socket inside of. So U Visual is above U Widget in the hierarchy because something needs to also be the parent of these slot objects. That's the reason that we don't start with U Visual. That actually goes down a separate branch of the tree. But U Object is the point that we actually start talking about the visual things being rendered in the actual widgets themselves. So as we said, U Widget is, and the same is true of really all UMG, is they are really wrappers for slate widgets. There are probably an exception that someone who knows this stuff very well can think of, but 99% of the time for every time you find a UMG widget there will be a matching slate widget. The standard nomenclature is that the UMG widget would be called what you expect it to be called, like a button is button and it has a button.h and a button.cpp. And then the slate widget that represents that button has the same name but just prefaced with an s. So you have button and then you have s button. Just to quickly demonstrate that, if we were to go to a button.h, we would see that we can see that U Button inherits from content widgets. So that's a little bit like, you know, there are kind of intermediary inheritances and that inherits from a panel widget. But essentially this eventually comes down to a U Widget. And the typical thing that you would see when looking at the C++ is most UMG widgets would at some point have within them some reference to an S widget, which is probably a shared pointer, because slate widgets themselves aren't part of the U Object hierarchy and therefore we can't use this kind of standard U property markup and have them kind of as reference counted like that. They need to be utilized as shared pointers. So typically you would see something like this. My is the normal kind of like nomenclature within the UMG world. So most of the time any widget you can think of, they will have a, if it's a switcher widget, then it would be my switcher. If it's a border widget, it would be my border. And that will be the S widget representing it. So again, we have the button.h and then similarly we have the s button.h. And so that is the slate. Slate is really the thing that actually does the displaying on screen. Slate is the thing that reacts to input. Slate is the thing that reacts to navigation and laying things out. UMG really just reacts as a kind of, like we said, a visual editor on top to help lay these slate widgets out in a kind of nice, easier to comprehend way. And they also give us a kind of way to interact with these things from Blueprint and kind of gain all those Blueprint advantages of being able to see kind of runtime representation of data in an easy way, very quick iteration cycles and all those kind of advantages that we already understand about Blueprints. Common widgets that would kind of like descend from the UWidget hierarchy that you might be using a lot when authoring your own kind of more complicated widgets would be TextBox for displaying text. Overlay is a kind of, we've talked about panels, which are objects that are widgets that can contain multiple children. So an overlay is a panel type where content is, as the name implies, one is rendered over the top of the next one. They're laid over each other, so the further for every new one is rendered over the previous ones. Horizontal box, pretty self-explanatory. Content is laid out, you know, left to right or right to left. And vertical box, similar, this isn't going to be surprising anyone. Content is laid out top to bottom or bottom to top. So I said it lies on top of Slate. Essentially when we're working with UWidget, the reason we might do it is it's kind of a more similar coding environment. We get access to event graphs, it's kind of like easier to iterate on. And also even in the C++ level, it probably looks a lot more like the rest of Unreal C++. Once you enter the Slate ecosystem, you do start seeing peculiar macros and you kind of just have to be a little bit aware of its own eccentricities. So it's definitely, it feels like a slightly specialized skill set to be going into Slate itself and authoring Slate stuff. But when you're within the kind of UWidget domain of things, it definitely feels a lot more like the rest of Unreal C++. Yeah, and also I've kind of already talked about this, but whenever creating a UWidget, actually we create an SWidget under the hood and that will be the actual thing that we end up seeing on screen. With the UWidget, it isn't really displayed, it just simply acts as a wrapper that communicates the information from our gameplay down to the thing that is actually drawn on screen that we actually interact with, that actually lays things out. We've talked about this in our fourth session, but it's just worth going back over that UMG widgets, as with the majority of things that kind of correlate more to player-side feedback, are intended to exist solely on the client. So yeah, widgets are intended to be spawned through a local, emphasis on the local there, player controller. The idea of a server having a widget is kind of a nonsense because, you know, most of the time servers are going to be headless, they're not going to have a display, so why would they need to have something that only exists to display visual data on a screen?",
