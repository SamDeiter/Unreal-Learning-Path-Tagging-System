  "text": " Now, in this next section of exploring Sequencer fundamentals, we're going to take a look at the core structures of Sequencer as we translate film concepts to the game engine. And before we get into using Sequencer, there is some terminology and comparisons that might help you understand Sequencer for first-time users. So, Unreal being a game engine has a more modular approach to building worlds. Plus, it has additional classifications of objects in order to create the game aspect of the engine. And you can use these classes to your distinct advantage as you understand the new terminology, such as the unique terms and actor classes that are broken down here into Engine Terminology and Sequencer Terminology. Now, with Engine Terminology, we'll discuss things like static and skeletal meshes, actors, pawns and characters, worlds, maps and levels, level sequences, control rigs, volumes, blueprints and source control. And while Sequencer-specific terminology will discuss scene assemblies, performance takes, sets, layouts or staging, level sequences with shots and, of course, shots. Now, in Unreal Engine, we have an actor class that you've just been introduced to known as a Level Sequence. And in a nutshell, a Level Sequence is another sort of container that can hold any number of actors like static meshes, characters, lights, cameras, etc. And through the Level Sequence, you can provide these actors with a set of instructions through the use of keyframes for animation or blueprint coding for triggered events. OK, now that we know what a Level Sequence is, we'll start from the bottom here and work our way up. But first, let's jump into the engine to get going. So Unreal Engine allows for the creation of individual shot level sequences that can be assembled to create a scene. So let's look at our first scene. Now, that's not all that you can do in here. Unreal also provides a take system which allows artists to create alternate versions of the Level Sequence shot that contains different sets of animated instructions. So here's our first shot. Now, if I go into my folders here and I take a look in here, I've got my scenes and my shots for scene one, shot one have another folder set aside. And inside that folder, I have two takes. So in traditional filmmaking, takes are typically a single continuous performance of varying duration where the actors go on set, they act out their performance, and then the director calls cut. Then typically, if you want another take, you just reset and do it all again. However, in Sequencer, all you have to do to create a take is make sure that your shots here are in the same folder and then duplicate the shot. So this shot was just a duplicate of shot one, take one. This is shot one, take two. Then you just make changes inside the level to create a new set of instructions. So if I look at this, my first shot, if I pass through here, is just the character walking up. If I right click on this and move up to my takes, you can see I've got take one and take two. If I switch to take two, my cameras are different. And that's because if I double click and open this, my instructions for take two are different than what they are for take one. So in take two, I have two cameras, shot camo one and shot camo two. If I jump back, reverse the takes and go back to take one and then open up my instructions, you can see I only have one camera in here. So once we're done, we can look at the scene level sequence where our shot level sequence lives and easily switch between these takes by quickly alternating between these two example shots. So they can either take your director once, they can keep or make another take to do additional changes without being destructive in nature. All I got to do here is just control D and that gives me another take, take three, that if I go ahead and switch to, go back to my scene, switch back over to take three now and double click, I have the ability to make additional changes to my instructions. So I can delete a camera, create new ones, or set up whatever shot I want for my director. Now as we look back at our film to Unreal Engine structure comparison chart, we can work from the takes and shots at the bottom toward the film level sequence at the top. Just like the shot level sequences that make up scene level sequences, the scene level sequences can be nested into a sequence level sequence and the sequence level sequences can be nested into an act level sequence and act level sequences can be nested into a film sequence at the top of our chart. Of course, you aren't required to use all of these nested level sequences, you can just use what is necessary for your specific project. Additionally, you also have the option of using a single level sequence and a set of scenic cameras along with the necessary camera cuts track to make a self-contained sequence with multiple coverage cameras for a sequence based linear workflow that we will create in our hands-on section later in this course. Now that's it for this section. Next we're going to move on to explore some sequencers features and tools.",
