  "text": " Now, Niagara is, at its core, a tool for creating visual effects or VFX inside of Unreal Engine 4. With Niagara, you can make anything from simple smoke and fire simulations to more complex crowd simulations that can even interact with users. At its core, Niagara is built for everyone in need of VFX. Whether you work in an architectural visualization or you're an industrial designer such as an automotive designer, you're going to find as much use with Niagara as someone from virtual TV and film production to video games. While there is so much that you can do with Niagara, it can often be hard to visualize. However, we're in luck because some of the very talented Epic artists have provided us with some content examples that show us how to do everything from skin particles to skeletal meshes, use Niagara to distort UV targets so that we can have the start of a simple fluid simulation, to even having a setup where the light acts as a attractor or deterrent for particles that are spawned on not only meshes but also surfaces of objects throughout the level. If we come over to the Epic Games launcher and click on the Learn tab, under Engine Feature Samples, there is the Content Examples Maps. The Content Examples Maps are a collection of content that show you how to use the various features that Unreal Engine 4 provides. By downloading and then creating a project, you can open up the content examples and then examine how to use certain features. Let's take a look at this by opening up our Niagara examples. We're going to go ahead and open up the Niagara Simple. And when we do this, what we're going to see is a setup of Niagara emitters going from Very Simple. So if we click on this one, let's go ahead and we'll right click here and Browse to Asset and we'll have a look at this. So we see here we have our very simple Niagara system that's nicely detailed with comments to explain what each part is doing. As we progress further and further down, the examples become more and more complex. By opening up the Niagara Advanced example, we can see how we can take Niagara and utilize it to work with many of the different systems inside of Unreal. By pressing the Simulate button, we can see here one of the examples shown in the previous slide of the mesh of the particles being skinned to a skeletal mesh. So as the mesh is moving, it looks like the particles are deforming off of the surface and then coming back onto the surface. We also have the scattering of the particles here based on the light. So as the light goes over the surface, the bugs are going to try to get out of the way of it. And then last but not least, we have our dissolve effect here, which is the start of, well, could be the start of a really interesting fluid simulation. We can see here these examples over here. If I just press Stop and again, I'm going to right click on this and browse to Asset and go ahead and open this up. We can see here how this effect is put together. We can see the comments of it and use this information in our quest to build something similar.",
