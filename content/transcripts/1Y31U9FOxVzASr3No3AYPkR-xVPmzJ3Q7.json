  "text": " Now that we have our background objects in place, our gameplay going, and even added some Niagara particle effects, let's talk about working with lights. Now, this particular level, since it takes place outdoors, uses a directional light for its main light source. Although there are a few other lights placed on the pickups, its main lighting is coming from this directional light. But it's not just this directional light that is contributing to the lighting that we're seeing in the scene. There's actually a lot of other actors in play. In our example, we're actually using a directional light to control the direction of the light is, but we're also utilizing a skylight to give us a bounce light or indirect lighting. We have a sky atmosphere, which is representing how that directional light would be coming through the atmosphere and being affected by any type of material that's in the atmosphere. We also have our volumetric clouds, which give us these really interesting looking puffy clouds, if you will. Then we also are utilizing what's known as a post-process volume, which allows us to further fine-tune the image that our end user is going to see. Let's take a look at how we can adjust all of this inside of the project now. One of the coolest things that we can do here is, once we have all of that set up our directional light, and if we come into our project here, let me just close some of this. We have our directional light, we have our sky atmosphere and our volumetric cloud as well as our skylight. One thing that we also have added here is the exponential height fog, so we can turn that off. That just gives us a little bit of extra fog, I think makes everything look just a little bit cooler. There's our post-process, and in this example here, what we can do is if we come all the way down here to this infinite extend unbounce, if I just disable that, you can see the post-process isn't doing a lot, it's just doing a little bit, but it's helping clamp down on some of these values. Let's go ahead and just, whoops, click on that one more time, there we go, and we are going to do this infinite. You can see here, it's just clamping down on the values just a tiny little bit. Now, one of the other cool things we can do is if you hold down Ctrl, Alt, and L, it can actually move my directional light around the scene. The coolest part about this is once I have my post-process volume in there, my sky atmosphere, my volumetric clouds and things like that, I can then just use this shortcut Ctrl, Alt, and L, and quickly position the light in any direction that just artistically looks very, very cool and gives us really interesting results. Remember, if I want to adjust anything, it's as simple as selecting one of these and then coming down in the details panel and adjusting whichever parameter I wish to adjust. For example, I can maybe increase the lighting intensity or maybe just decrease it a little bit. With my sky atmosphere, I could change things like if I come down here to my art direction, my sky luminance factor, I can adjust things like that, which will adjust how the sky, as you can see there, it's a little more purplish or a little more bluish, whichever direction I want to go. Looks kind of cool, looks kind of purplish outside. What everybody did do now is just spend a few minutes adjusting your sky atmosphere. Remember, Ctrl, Alt, and L will give you that cool gizmo that allows you to quickly use your mouse to adjust where the position of your directional light is in relation to your scene. And you can feel free to adjust the host process or whatever settings you want and try to come up with some interesting look that helps compliment what you have just previously created.",
