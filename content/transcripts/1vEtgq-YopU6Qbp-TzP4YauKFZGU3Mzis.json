  "text": " So the first thing we want to do is we want to go to the event graph, so we click on the event graph here. If you can't find your event graph, just go to window and make sure your viewpoint is set and then it should reappear for you. But yeah, closing and opening that blueprint should make it reappear for you. And what we'll do is we will select the box on the top left hand side here on the details panel, again this details panel that we spoke about when editing the box extent. I'm going to scroll down using my mouse wheel or you can use the bar and we see a series of events here that we can call. So we're going to go to select on component begin overlap which is the second event and we're just going to click this big green plus arrow that looks really inviting to us. So let's go ahead and click that. So we've got on component begin overlap. Now this is an event inside of Unreal Engine. This will fire some kind of information. So it comes out of this white execution pin. So whatever this event fires, it will come out of here and that will be executing a series of blueprints depending on what we decide to happen. Let's not worry too much about these other outputs for now. You'll get into these as you continue in your blueprint journey. Today we'll probably only be using the other actor one for context but let's just think about the execution flow for now and now we've added this begin overlap. Now if you don't see this, if you don't see in brackets box, it means that that box isn't referring to this and when you click on the box you'll be able to see on begin overlap it says view and you can see that. So if you can't see that now and it doesn't say box in brackets then be sure to just go back to your box blueprint or your box component sorry and make sure the begin overlap is there. Now in the aim of good naming conventions, let's rename box. So I've just clicked it, clicked the property just to rename it. It's a single click and then a single click again to rename or we can right click rename or you can hit F2 and I'm going to call this player overlap and as your blueprints get bigger and the code gets more complex, just good naming conventions will really help you in the long run. So we've renamed this player overlap, we can see this is updated to player overlap, we'll compile and save. Now we need to figure out the functionality. What do we want to happen when the player overlaps the door? Well let's think about opening the door. So we want to get this door and we want to rotate it open. So you'll see that when I rotated this door, again you don't need to do this but you'll see the rotation is minus 50. So when I rotate, close it, it's at 0. When I rotate it open say to 80 degrees, it's minus 80 degrees. So let's go ahead and do that. Let's set the rotation of the door. So to get a gameplay functionality based on a component on this list, you can actually drag and drop it out. So I'm going to get the door and drag and drop, which is just left mouse drag, drag and drop. And then I'm going to drag off the blue output. I'm going to say set relative. So set relative and we want to set relative rotation. So select set relative rotation from the list. Now I'm going to drag out of the white execution box and into this execution box. And it's a good thing to note here that all blueprint code will always fire from left to right. It will always follow that sequence. So we're getting the door, we're setting the rotation and the Z rotation that we just saw when we rotated the door in our viewpoint was, let's call it 80 degrees and let's see what happens here. We can go to minus 90 to make it fully open but let's just see what happens here. So we compile, we save, we go back into our map, let's go to play and let's run over to our door and see what happens. Now we're on the opposite side of the door if you notice there. So I'm just going to go from the correct way first and we open the door, set it to 80 degrees. Now just as a quick debugging, I want to hit escape and I'm going to go back to the door and you'll see in the top right hand side here you'll see BP door which is selected. So make sure that you have your BP door. It doesn't need to say selected because that's just because we have it selected in the map but as long as it says BP door that's what you're looking for. And I'm going to get my blueprint window and I'm just going to drag it down. Maybe if you're working on a second screen you could drag it over to your second screen. And again you don't have to do this but I just want to show you the flow of logic here. So I want to find a space on my screen where I can see these two blueprint nodes and what I'm going to look for is I'm going to look for something that activates this line and as soon as I walk over to that door you'll see that line fire and you'll see it set the rotation. So I'm just going to hit play again. I'm going to run over to this door picking up my weapon as I go just in case there's anything through the door that I need to attack. I'm going to go over to my door and you'll see that that blueprint pin fired on the bottom right hand side there. So again I'll just do it quickly again. You'll see that I run over to the door and you see the blueprint pin fire and that shows that our code is executing. So if we just drag it back up there. If ever you run into blueprints that aren't working and you think why is this not working? The first thing to do would be to add your debug, drag the window into view so you can see it and it's just a good process. For those from C++ you can actually have breakpoints to your code by hitting F9. So if you ever hit F9 on your keyboard so we hit F9. You can add a breakpoint to this which will stop the gameplay going. So if I zoom out and I hit play I hit the door and it will stop that blueprint point. So it's paused my game. It says you've hit this breakpoint and you may want to find some functionality that's going on. So that's more advanced blueprinting. I think it's worth noting for now because it's just useful to know if your blueprints aren't working but at least we've got something that sets the rotation of the door when we hit it to 80 degrees. We can either stop when we hit this breakpoint or hit play. So I'll just resume here and so we can't get through the door at the moment. That must be because we got some kind of collision. We've hit that breakpoint again so I can just remove that. But we see our door working. We can't go through it yet so maybe we'll make that door a little bit wider. But for now we've got our blueprint code in a good place. I'm just going to stop playing. I'm going to turn off this breakpoint by hitting F9 on my keyboard and now we'll figure out how to make the door open a little bit more cleanly. We've set the rotation of the door but how do we make it lurb open? How do we make that door look a little bit better? So let's go ahead and do that now.",
