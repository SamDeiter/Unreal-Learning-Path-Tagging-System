  "text": " All right, now that we have seen how to create grooms, get them imported, and apply materials to them, let's talk about applying grooms to assets. Now you can use a groom assets in several different ways, thanks to the groom component. You can add groom components to actors or blueprints, and no matter which way you decide to add your groom, you're going to interact with the groom in the same way. As soon as you add the groom component, you will then have the option to assign a groom asset and a groom binding, as well as whether or not it should use cards and a cash and some other advanced features. Now first off, let's take a look at doing this just at the level asset. So what we're going to do now is we're going to add the mannequin and then add our groom asset to it. So let's just remove this one here and we're going to hit control space and we're going to go to our mannequin's, not anum's, I'm sorry, but meshes. We're going to grab our SKM Manny Simple. I'm just going to drag that out. And then all we need to do is go over here to the add and we're going to look for a groom. And there we go. And once we have that, we just need to come down here to the groom asset and select our hair and then just pull that hair up a little bit so that it kind of sits on the head there. The reason it doesn't exactly, well in this case I think it looks kind of cool, but the reason it doesn't sit there exactly on top of the head is that this groom asset is something that I just imported and wasn't specifically made for this mannequin's head. Once you have a groom asset that is specifically made for your asset, you're not going to need to pull it up. It will come in and it will have that rock solid coverage that you're looking for. Now you can also do this exact same process via a blueprint. All you need to do is add a skeletal mesh and then your groom asset. Once you've added the groom component, you go to your groom asset and then apply the groom that you wish. And again, in our particular case, using the mannequin and this hair, since they are not necessarily designed for one another, we are going to have to move that hair up a little bit. Let's just pop over to the editor and take a look at this blueprint in action. So we're going to come up here to content. So we have this BP groom here and this was simply made by right clicking blueprint class, selecting the actor and giving it a name of BP groom. Once we had it open in the viewport, all we did was add a skeletal mesh. And in our case, we gave it this SK mani. And then we also use this animation asset just to show you that the hair can react to the animation here. We also went to add and added a groom. There we go. There's our groom. Here we just applied our groom asset, the hair here. And once we did that, we just had to pull it up just a tiny bit. You can see here up about 20 and about forward on the wide about 10 there just to get it on the the character's head. And that is all that we had to do. Then once we've done that, we can go pile and save this. And then we're going to hit control space and just bring this into the level. And there we go. We've got a groom on our mannequin. So again, very, very simple way to get groom going. And you can use groom for multiple things. We could have a groom for the hair, but we could also have something for maybe eyebrows or chest hair or arm hair or leg hair. We can do a lot of different things with groom inside of Unreal Engine.",
