  "text": " In this next section, we're going to look at some key technologies for ICD effects, including our virtual production technology family tree. So this is something that we've been are in the process of developing. It's just basically a visual guide to show you where a lot of the different technologies that are implemented in ICD effects, where they reside and how and what are involved with them. I mean, if you look just on a basic level, we talk about Perforce, Unreal Engine, and the various stage engineering requirements. We're going to get into the stage engineering requirements in a little bit. But if we look specifically under Unreal Engine, we have some things to call out here. Virtual scouting, real-time environments, digital humans, camera, the LED wall itself, of course, various compositing technology, and what's needed for practical lights. And as you can see, there's a number of additional tools and capabilities within Unreal Engine that are derived by these specific needs. For virtual scouting, of course, we have the implementation of VR and LIDAR scans, real-time environments. Well, there's Quixel, which is a product that you should become available with, with the various mega scans that can help to populate your virtual environments. The digital human aspect of all of this, there is MetaHumans, which is something that has been released about a year ago, maybe a little bit more. This implements various technologies like Control Rig and Live Link, along with various facial capture systems that Epic has utilized to do live facial capture using an iOS device like an iPhone. And then, you know, there's also the various elements of being able to integrate animation in from various DCC applications, traditional animation and traditional characters and how they're rigged. And then to the camera itself, how do we track a camera? And again, it's utilizing a lot of the Live Link protocols that we've developed in order to communicate back and forth between objects and Unreal Engine. There is the number of different I.O. cards that we utilize for bringing in visual imagery from the camera, whether they're using Black Magic cards or Kona cards. These are ways in order to get visual information into the engine that you can use for all kinds of different purposes. There's the LED wall, of course, and all the associated technologies there. End display, switchboard, web remote. All of these are different technologies and capabilities that you'll be learning throughout this particular program. And then also compositing with Composure and practical lighting capabilities and being able to control lights through DMX. Now, these key virtual production technologies, there's some in specific that I want to call out. First are a series of production design tools. So production design is unquestionably one of the most important aspects of the whole LED volume in camera visual effects process. You need to be able to adequately create and prepare the items that you plan to shoot, whether it's practically or virtually. So in a virtual setting, we want to talk about being able to do virtual set scouting. We want to be able to combine various GIS data, LIDAR data, drone scanning and so forth in order to create the worlds that you plan to shoot. And this can be very important when you're trying to decide how much needs to be practically shot versus how much can be done inside of an LED wall. And when you have these environments scanned and built, they can be really crucial, critical even, for your planning process and pre-production. How great would it be to be able to basically have a scan of the environment of where you're planning to eventually shoot live action elements in. From there, you can set scout and look at all of the different options available to you. There's also some key virtual production technologies for various visualization tools. Now, I talked about PreViz. PreViz was a very early forerunner to a lot of the processes and workflows that we're utilizing and observing in the ICV effects process. But now with real time PreViz, you have the option of basically being more iterative and having the ability to interact with the data and have potentially your director, your visual effects supervisor, your cinematographer, all being able to come in and look at Unreal in order to provide their feedback in real time. You can do character blocking, you can do virtual camera blocking, and all of this can be either done on the day or potentially again using the multi-user capabilities inside of Unreal. You could potentially have the ability for your director, your cinematographer, your motion capture actors, all in different locations working together in session within Unreal Engine. This will again ultimately feed the whole ability to create some really nice preliminary sequence designs and constructions which can feed the whole creative process.",
