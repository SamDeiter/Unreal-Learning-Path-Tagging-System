  "text": " Hey everyone, my name is Martin Cousens. I'm going to be your host of the day for our training session looking into Introduction to Networking in Unreal Engine for Programmers in Unreal 5.5. This is the fourth session out of five, so if you haven't seen those previous videos, there will be perhaps a little bit of overlap in some small bits, but you can absolutely watch this in isolation. The first three were into C++ in general, gameplay specifically, AI, this one's going to be about multiplayer and networking, and last of all we have UMG. So what are we going to be covering today? First off we've got the server client model, gameplay frameworks, variable replication, remote procedure calls or RPCs, relevancy, dormancy, net role and net mode, active replication flow, and then replication graph, which is a plugin you can or don't have to utilize alongside other replication logic, traversing in multiplayer and lastly testing in multiplayer. This is a largely theoretical concept-based tutorial so I just want to highlight that from the off. We're going to do a little bit of in-engine stuff right at the end when we're talking about testing, but for the most part we're just going to discuss topics that I've not necessarily got much in the way of in-engine demos to show off. So just thought I'd give you a heads up about that.",
