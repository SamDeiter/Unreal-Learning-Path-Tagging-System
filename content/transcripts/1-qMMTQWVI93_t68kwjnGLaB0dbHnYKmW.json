  "text": " So, let's first take a look at planning for the control rig and some considerations to make when you're thinking about how your mechanical mesh should be deforming. So it's useful to think of it as sort of rigid body versus organic skinning and thinking about how each particular piece of the mesh needs to deform. So mechanical meshes are typically rigid bodies and should be skinned to one bone each. So it's very likely that all of your mechanical meshes are broken into many different parts and you know they're all connected and held together with screws and bolts and rivets and they all have different pivot points. So you want these solid parts to only be skinned to one bone so that they don't deform in an unusual way and you know look all bendy when it's animating. But that's not necessarily going to be true for every part of your skeletal mesh. Meshes like springs should be weighted perfectly evenly between two bones so that when they compress and contracts they'll be deforming accurately. And you may also have parts like cables or wires on your mesh that are carrying things like hydraulic fluid or electrical cables and these obviously are going to need to deform in a more organic way than this big chunk of solid metal. So they may have several influences from different joints depending on how long they are and how they might need to deform. So it's really about considering and thinking how each part of the mesh needs to deform and then just skinning them in the appropriate way to make the rigging in the engine a bit more straightforward for yourself. When it comes to orienting your bones it can be really helpful to orient them in the direction of travel. So typically we would use the x-axis to point down the bone in the direction that that mesh would travel. And this is just going to help speed up your rigging workflow in the engine. So when you're thinking about things like pistons or any sort of telescopic type movement, being consistent with your axis that you're pointing down the bone can be really helpful. When it comes to meshes that act in the same way, so like the tyres of a car for example, they're all going to be rolling the same and sort of turning the same, setting up all of the bones with the same orientation, and this could just be world orienting them for example, can be really helpful and simplify the control rig logic again, because you can use the same logic for all of these tyres instead of making sort of custom adjustments per tyre to account for any differences in their orientations. Mirroring bone orientations by behaviour can also be very helpful, because if you have something like a claw grabber that we have here, we can set things up so that we can feed the same logic into both bones and easily use one control to manipulate both of them. So in this example with this sort of claw grabber that we have here, the logic has been set up so that we can move this teal coloured controller left and right, and as we do that the claw will open and close without having to add any extra logic to account for the differences in their orientation. So we're just grabbing the transform values and converting it to rotations and feeding that straight into the claw bones. And that's only possible if you mirror by behaviour. Something that you might find with your skeleton hierarchy is that you end up having fewer chains of bones and more individual children coming off a shared parent. So in this example here, we've got a car where we have a root and then each of the wheels and the doors simply have a single bone to control those meshes. And with this example of the suspension on the car chassis, you can see that this rear and everything that's fixed to it is a child of the same parent on the right here. And that's because any meshes like suspension springs or damper arms here where each end is fixed to a different mesh, making those bones a child of the mesh that they're fixed to is going to make things much easier when you're rigging an engine than if you had a chain of bones here instead. So with a mechanical rig, you'll probably find that you have fewer chains of joints and more single children coming from shared parents of the things that they're affixed to.",
