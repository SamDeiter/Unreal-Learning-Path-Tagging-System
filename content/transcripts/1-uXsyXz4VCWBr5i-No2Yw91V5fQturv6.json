  "text": " All right, let's begin with an overview of ICVFX. So when we talk about ICVFX, it actually falls under an umbrella term called virtual production. And virtual production has a number of different classifications that we should discuss. Number one, visualization. This is basically what we originally considered pre-visualization, and it includes a number of various forms of 3D pre-visualization and virtual scouting. A lot of these tools have basically evolved to be part of this process, and they're included under the entire term of virtual production. Secondly, there's performance capture. And this, again, another broad term, it includes things like standard mocap, performance capture in general, facial capture, and even keyframe animation. Everything needs to have some sort of source for performance. Then we move on to traditional hybridized VFX production. Now, this is getting into a much larger space. This is the classic green screen along with tracking markers that is used to construct various VFX shots, typically building out various layers and bringing things together in comp at a post-production facility. And then finally, we have in-camera visual effects. And it's this particular category that we want to talk about today. This is the whole LED wall virtual production based process in which you're filming everything through the camera along with what you're seeing behind the actual foreground actor on an LED wall. But there are a number of different project types that we usually refer to, and they are basically fully animated production. This is a form of virtual production. Obviously, everything is computer generated and in CG. There's a live action equivalent, of course, where we're shooting live action content and we're using the virtual production and VFX process in order to comp in various backgrounds, matte extensions, set extensions, and other types of effects. And then finally, the whole CG live action hybrid, we're bringing it all together on the stage, in-camera visual effects in hand. In order to get a better appreciation as to how in-camera visual effects developed, we're going to look at some historical context. And this is always something that's of interest to a lot of people. But ICV effects just didn't spontaneously appear. It actually has a number of different forerunners to it. So let's first talk about the Pepper's ghost technique. This is basically it's an optical illusion. It was designed to reflect the performance on a pane of glass that was between the performer and the actual audience. And this was popularized by Disney for its Haunted Mansion ride. And it's actually been used today at current modern times, particularly for producing like a form of hologram of famous actors like Michael Jackson or Tupac. There was a number of them that have used this technique. Next, we'll talk about rear screen projection. Now, this is kind of a classic, and it's usually associated with a lot of people who consider these films to be like B movies nowadays. But this was really a simple technique. It was basically combining a projection pre-filmed reversed background, and it was projected onto a screen so that you'd have a central foreground actor and the rear screen behind him. This technique was perfected pretty much, you know, its highest point was 2001, A Space Odyssey. They used it there, but it was used on an array of different films throughout the 1930s all the way up to the 1970s. Next, we have front screen projection. Now, this is basically it's a derivative of rear screen projection, where again, that pre-film content was composited behind the actor. But the way that the image was brought and projected was a little bit of a trick. They usually and typically use like a prism or some sort of beam splitter in order to project the image from the front of the screen rather than from the back of the screen. And this afforded us some extra benefits. Number one, the image was brighter and the colors were more saturated. And this basically is again still being used today. There's been a number of modern productions that have used this, like Oblivion used front screen projection for a number of its visual effects shots. But it's films that you normally saw during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Let's take a look at our next one, which was dynamation. Now, this is a Ray Harryhausen technique that is a combination of different things. It's basically combining stop motion animation on one plane, along with a rear projected screen on another plane and then a foreground matte. And this is kind of a very interesting precursor to a number of different techniques used in animation as well. I list it within virtual production as a forerunner for all of this because it is really forward thinking in a lot of different ways. Next is the sodium vapor process. Now, this process utilizes a photochemical approach to filmmaking where it combines actors and backgrounds together. This originated in the 1950s and it was heavily utilized by Walt Disney again. And they called it yellow screening. And this utilizes basically really powerful sodium vapor lights that have a specific wavelength and cast and a camera that, again, utilizing a beam splitter. This prism was exposed to different, basically separate films. And one would be the beauty pass in full color. And the other would basically be a black and white matte pass that was used to help with bringing the composite together. This was the first precursor to the blue screening techniques, which we see next, blue chroma key. This was designed after the traveling matte technique was perfected and developed by RKO Pictures, Radio Pictures in the 1930s. A blue screen process developed along yellow screening and used a very similar technique of combining an optical printer with two projectors and a camera and a beam splitter in order to produce these two passes, one for the beauty pass and one for the matte pass. This blue screening technique eventually became the favorite over yellow screening, and it was used a lot during the early or excuse me, the late 20th century. Blue screening eventually evolved into green screening. And this is a process that was developed in the early 1970s by American British television networks and various newscast centers. We were starting to see the beginnings of the microcomputer age, and this basically assisted and eventually evolved past the optical printing process and started to combine, of course, with computer graphic imagery. So green was selected over blue just due to the fact that green was not as heavily utilized and is not normally found in, you know, typically in the skin of most people. Green screen was just a better approach for that, whereas you see that a lot of skin tones have a lot of blue in it. So they moved over to green as a better process. Ultimately, through the use and advancements of computer graphic and aided imagery, the green screen technique was combined with tracking markers where the movement of the camera could be reverse engineered and fed into various different compositing programs, allowing you to basically combine computer graphic animation along with live action film. This ultimately gave way and is giving way to the process that we're talking about today, which is in-camera visual effects. Now, this is basically the earliest forerunner to this. You're probably familiar with it. It's the Mandalorian. And this was basically a whole amalgamation of techniques that are being brought together, computer graphic technologies, motion capture, camera tracking. All of this is combined with live real time graphics that are being generated and put onto an LED wall. And this is something that we're going to be talking about today. What does this LED wall look like, how it's put together and constructed and so forth? And this allows, of course, for any kind of computer generated imagery to be placed behind the actor. And when combined with some mid ground elements and some foreground action, you can construct some very, very believable effects that can be shot in camera in real time. And it's really quite an advancement.",
