  "text": " A critical thing we need to keep in mind when building network games is detecting the environment that we're running in. For that we have the net modes enum. Frankly the net mode is the most watertight way of querying whether or not the current environment is a client or a server one, a fact that often impacts our implementations. Let's take a look at what net modes come with Unreal and where we might use them. First up we have the standalone net mode. This executable is running in total isolation and is in no way subject to a server's authority. We can pretty much surmise that we're running a single player game at this point. The dedicated server net mode however is exactly as you'd expect. It's a dedicated server with no local controllers only connecting clients. The listen server net mode is a bit of a blend. This executable is acting as both client and a server. Other controllers are connecting to this client with this local client being the host. The client net mode is the opposite of the dedicated server as you'd expect. This executable is connecting to a remote authoritative server. Net mode checks often come into play when building out features that have both front and back ends. So let's take a health component for instance. We'd want to check that we're currently under the dedicated server net mode when actually applying damage, but we'd want to check if we're under the client net mode when playing any on-screen effects or updating any UI elements. A net mode check is the safest way of checking you're currently under the appropriate environment. Although thematically similar to net mode, net role deals more specifically with the authority of the given circumstance. It won't directly tell us if we're on a server or not, but it will let us know if the current environment is authoritative or an actor. When we call get local role on an actor, we returned one of three roles. Authority lets us know that this actor was spawned locally. This environment spawned it and can refer to both clients and servers. Should we change anything about this actor under the authority role, we know that A, a server isn't going to correct it back to another value, and B, if we're currently on a server and this actor is replicated, the change may be propagated down through replication. It really is critical to note that authority absolutely does not mean server. It expressly means that the actor in question was spawned locally and is seen as the single source of truth in regards to how this actor is altered. Case in point, a client responding to damage locally by spawning VFX would be spawning authoritative particle systems. Simulated proxy, however, means the actor was spawned on the server and replicated down to the local client. It's owned by another client, but requires representation locally. A perfect example of this would be another player in your world. Some other client owns it, but the server is still authoritative. It has been sent to the local machine because it requires some kind of representation. Conversely, autonomous proxy is the other side of the coin. The actor was spawned on the server, but the local machine owns it, so that would be your player character in this context.",
