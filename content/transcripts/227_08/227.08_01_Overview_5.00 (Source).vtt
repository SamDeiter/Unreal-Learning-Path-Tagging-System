Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on intermediate HMI pipeline, which

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.280
is more of a technical course.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
Today we'll be covering engineering concepts, we'll talk about some design considerations,

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.000
we'll talk about some DevOps tools you can use, and then talk about how to optimize projects.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800
And then we'll jump in with a little hands-on workshop to show you actually how to deploy

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.360
and package builds with some interaction.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
So let's get stuck in.
