1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Let's now dig into the developer operations section.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.280
So we'll have quite a lot of in-depth information

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.040
pointing you to the correct areas of either documentation

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.040
or tools that you might be able to use when working

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.440
with HMI in your projects.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.640
So the first tool we want to go over today

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.920
is the sometimes you'll see it be referred to as UAT,

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.580
but it's essentially the Unreal Automation Tool.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.060
So the automation tool is a host program

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.620
and a set of utility libraries you

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.900
can use to script unattended processes relating

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.500
to Unreal Engine when using C Sharp.

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.860
So internally, we use the UAT for a variety of tasks,

14
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.740
including building and cooking and running games.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.220
You can run automation tests and script other operations that

16
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.980
can be executed on your build farm.

17
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.540
So the source code for the automation tool

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.660
and various scripts that run it can be found in your project

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.620
in the Engine Source Programs Automation Tool.

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.020
So you just want to go to where your Unreal Engine is installed,

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.300
go to Engine Source Programs Automation Tool,

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.580
and you can find that there.

23
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.180
So the automation system is built

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.940
on top of a functional testing framework, which

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.760
is designed to do gameplay level testing, which

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.980
works by performing one or more automation tests.

27
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.260
So the more tests that are written,

28
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.620
there may be more functional in nature,

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.660
either low level core or editor tests that need to be written.

30
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.340
You can use the automation framework system for these.

31
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.700
So the test can be written, broken down

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.420
into different categories, depending on their purpose.

33
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.940
So you might have a unit test or a feature test or a smoke test.

34
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.300
You may have heard these phrases before.

35
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.940
You can even do things like screenshot comparisons.

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.580
But if you do want to dig into this deeper,

37
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.100
there again is great documentation.

38
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.980
It's the testing and optimization

39
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.180
section of the documentation.

40
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.340
And there you can dig into exactly what the UAT is

41
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.300
and how to use it in your own projects.

42
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.380
We've also got continuous integration

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900
and continuous deployment.

44
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.300
So as part of a packaging process,

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100
which we'll dig into a little bit later here,

46
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.900
the automation tool can be used for this.

47
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.820
And it's used to work through a set of utility scripts

48
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.300
for manipulating Unreal Engine projects.

49
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.700
So for the packaging process, the automation tool

50
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480
uses a particular command called build cook run.

51
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.220
And this command can cook content from a platform,

52
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.140
package it into the platform's native format for distribution,

53
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.220
and then deploys it to a device.

54
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.300
And it can automatically run the project where you want it to.

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.460
So packaging your project doesn't solely

56
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.140
require the use of the UAT.

57
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.020
But you can use it from the File menu

58
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.820
to select the available platforms or the command line

59
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.020
to cook and package the content for a platform.

60
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.820
So when we look at Gauntlet, Gauntlet

61
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.700
is a framework to run things and validate results.

62
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.660
It's specifically designed.

63
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.460
It's not limited to this, but for running Unreal sessions

64
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.860
on a variety of platforms.

65
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.100
So an Unreal session is all the processes

66
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.380
needed to execute a game with Unreal Engine.

67
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.940
So you may have a multiplayer game

68
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.500
that requires four clients and a server.

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.740
You can use Gauntlet for that.

70
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.540
And then Jenkins is an automation.

71
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.460
Jenkins in relation to automation is recommended.

72
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.460
So you can combine it with the P4 plugin

73
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.060
to manage the data, the P4 being the Perforce plugin.

74
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300
And you can build a trigger for automatically building

75
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.940
your game.

76
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.500
So a few good documentation pages to follow here as well.

77
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.760
You've got Launching Unreal Engine Projects on Devices,

78
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.700
which is a great documentation page.

79
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.580
We've got Packaging and Cooking Games in Unreal Engine.

80
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.420
And we've also got Build Operations, Cooking,

81
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.820
Packaging, Deploying, and Running Projects

82
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.660
in Unreal Engine, which are all useful documentation pages

83
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.140
to look into more.

84
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.860
When we look at the hardware considerations of our projects,

85
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.100
we want to know about the GPU versus CPU utilization.

86
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.500
We want to know what background processes are going on based

87
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.460
on the setup of any kind of specific vehicle hardware.

88
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.980
We've got resolution scaling for optimization,

89
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.100
depending on what screen we're using.

90
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.220
We want to measure the performance available on Vulkan

91
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.100
but not OpenGL.

92
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.740
And you can also have device profiles,

93
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.100
which you can customize the rendering settings

94
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.780
on a per hardware basis.

95
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.660
You can do all this in the project files, in config,

96
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.460
default device profiles, any.

97
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.740
So in your Windows Explorer, just

98
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.860
go to your config folder of your project,

99
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.180
and you can find the default device profiles there.

100
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.980
When you're working with multiple people in your team,

101
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.740
this is good for solo development as well,

102
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.020
but especially so when you're working in teams,

103
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.380
we want some kind of version control.

104
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.860
So version control helps prevent conflict resolution

105
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.900
and asset locking.

106
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.780
So it's almost like a library system

107
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.460
where you can lock a file, take it out,

108
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.260
use it without someone else editing that same file.

109
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.340
So GitHub alone is not good source control.

110
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.420
We have a few options here.

111
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.020
You've also got the multi-user editing

112
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.860
plug-in on local network.

113
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.260
But however you want to approach team development or solo

114
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.540
development, it's definitely advisable to use version

115
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.380
control.

116
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.220
So again, some good documentation here.

117
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.180
Using source control in Unreal Engine

118
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.020
is a good documentation page, and also the multi-user editing

119
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.820
in Unreal Engine is a really good documentation hub.

120
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.900
When we look at using Unreal Engine source,

121
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.460
you can grab that from GitHub.

122
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.740
You just need to connect your Unreal Engine account for this,

123
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.340
and you can just set up the menus and the connections here.

124
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.220
And then we also want to install Visual Studio to build

125
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.940
the source files from Unreal Engine.

126
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.780
So no matter which source control software

127
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.660
you end up using, the manner in which you interface

128
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.500
with that software from inside of Unreal is the same.

129
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.540
So the following guides that I'm about to say

130
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.580
will detail everything you need to know about source control

131
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.100
in Unreal Engine.

132
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.780
So we have development setup building in Unreal Engine

133
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.900
on the production side.

134
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.980
We've also got just a source control in.

135
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.500
If you go to the production pipeline setting

136
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.420
in Unreal documentation, that's a really good place to start.

137
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.340
So just production pipelines.

138
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.940
And then there's a source control specific area

139
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.620
in there, which you can see has in editor, per force,

140
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.420
and SVN documentation.

141
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.620
So that's a really good place to start

142
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.980
learning about how you might integrate the engine code,

143
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.700
but also just source control into your projects.

144
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.700
And when we look at the Make AAR,

145
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.540
Make AAR versus the Android application,

146
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.020
where we should use UE's library.

147
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.540
So the Make AAR generates an AAR,

148
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.460
which is the engine wrapped into an AAR

149
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:46.460
and provides a Java-based API to initialize control at runtime.

150
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.740
It sends data to and from the engine via blueprints.

151
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.220
So the engine visualizes essentially

152
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.940
any of the visuals from the engine

153
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.660
are injected into the graphics library context

154
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.020
for the Android Surface View.

155
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.780
So basically, Make AAR integrates Unreal Engine

156
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.460
into existing Android apps to render on your Surface View.

157
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.780
So normally, Unreal would be its own application

158
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.380
when you package it.

159
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.020
But if you want to run Unreal inside of an Android Studio

160
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.140
project using something like Surface View Target,

161
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.020
or you want Unreal to be the full screen application,

162
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.380
you don't need to use Make AAR.

163
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.340
And when we're looking at cross-compiling here,

164
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.820
we can compile Windows to Linux.

165
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.820
And also the Mac native compiling.

166
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.180
So cross-compiling makes it possible for developers

167
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.700
to target Linux from Windows.

168
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.460
And at this time, cross-compiling is only

169
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.140
supported for Windows and Mac users.

170
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.980
You currently have to the results of the native compiling.

171
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.100
Additionally, we do support test and provide libraries

172
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.300
and tool chains for Linux x86 on the 64 platform.

173
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.740
And if you do want to look at the documentation page,

174
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.420
that's sharing and releasing with Linux

175
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.180
in the native tool chain.

176
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:13.900
So since Unreal 4.0, and so if you're using Unreal Engine 5

177
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.420
and onwards, the setup shell automatically

178
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.860
downloads the tool chain, which generates to your computer

179
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.220
