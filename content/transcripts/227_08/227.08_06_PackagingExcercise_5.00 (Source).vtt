00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now to wrap up, let's talk about how we might package our projects.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200
We've been talking about how we might approach the actual development tools.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.700
Now, how do we get the project that we've created and deploy it to the target platform?

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
So it's important to note there's a variety of different packaging types you can use.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140
You can use Dev versus Release.

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.940
So if you want to have console commands access to you or any kind of development information,

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.440
as we spoke about in a previous slide, you can use a Dev Release for this to be able to just debug any information.

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.140
And if you want Release, then there'll be no access.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.740
It's for the end consumer or the end user that you want to experience that.

10
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.740
You don't really want the debug information in there.

11
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.140
So we can get started by the Unreal Engine Android development.

12
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.540
And so we can run the setup Android back, which is found in our Epic Games engine folder.

13
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.340
We want to install Android Studio.

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:11.440
And then if using the 5.0 version of Unreal Engine, you want to install these extra versions.

15
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.240
So anything 5.1 on later will already come with some of this content.

16
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.640
So just double check which versions you're using and install the relevant APIs.

17
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.740
You can also enable developer mode on the device.

18
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.740
You want to check your Android version and typically tap in build number seven times.

19
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.140
We'll allow that here on the bottom left hand side that you can see.

20
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.740
And make sure don't sleep while charging is enabled and then also allow USB debugging.

21
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.840
When we're making a new project, we want to create a new blank project in Unreal Engine.

22
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.440
So you just want to load the Epic Games launcher, pick a project, but then pick a blank project

23
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.040
because this will be the cleanest version of a project that you can cook and package.

24
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.440
And we want to just make sure the mobile and minimal settings are applied.

25
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.140
So when you see the new project screen, you can just make sure you tick it's for mobile

26
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.040
and the minimal settings are applied there.

27
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740
Then we can make a blank map.

28
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.840
And if we go to maps and modes in the project settings, so to find the project settings,

29
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.840
we go to edit at the top, go down to project settings and there'll be a maps and modes in the project setting.

30
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.940
And this new map that we've created, you can just assign that map as the editor startup map and also the game default map.

31
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.740
The game mode and instance can be set there as well.

32
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.140
If you want to update that or change that.

33
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.840
When we've created a new level, we want to create a couple of new blueprints.

34
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.340
So we want to create a new controller and a new game mode.

35
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.440
So for testing, you may be able to enable mouse click events.

36
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:10.040
So you can do that in the controller as we showed earlier in the course, enable touch events there, enable click events is also accessible.

37
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.940
When we've created the new controller in the game mode, we can then just assign those in the actual game instance class that we have.

38
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.640
So you'll see again, these changed icons here.

39
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.740
This is what we've got.

40
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.740
So we've got our custom controller.

41
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.940
We've got our hood class and we've got our palm class.

42
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.440
Next, we will make sure our project settings are set up correctly for Android.

43
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.040
So we'll go back into our project settings.

44
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.140
Again, you can find it edit at the top of your Unreal Engine browser and go to project settings.

45
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.440
Go to the platform section and find Android and you just want to make sure you configure your project for Android here.

46
00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:00.440
And then optional, but you can show console on four finger tap, which is the tick box there just in case you want any debug information.

47
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.240
We can then create a new UMG widget by right clicking in your content browser,

48
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.240
going to user interface and adding a widget blueprint.

49
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.840
And you just when this box comes up, you can just click use a widget here.

50
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.140
That's fine.

51
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.940
And then we want to just create a basic window like this.

52
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.840
So you want the canvas panel at the bottom as your first property here.

53
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.240
And then you've got a background image.

54
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.140
We've also got a test button and some test text.

55
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:40.240
So we've just created a basic UMG like this with some kind of button that will be accessed within the blueprint.

56
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:49.440
So in the blueprint, we want to make sure we load up the custom controller that we assign to our game instance on event begin play of the controller.

57
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.540
We want to drag off event begin play.

58
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.540
And if you just type create widgets, then.

59
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.140
It'll add a create widget box and we just want to assign the UMG widget that we just created in the previous slide.

60
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.540
So when you assign that there, that will the text here will update to whatever you called your widgets.

61
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.540
So in this instance, we called it example widget.

62
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.640
And so you can see create example widget widget.

63
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.440
When you drag off owning player, drag off to the left and type self that will create a little self reference.

64
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.940
And it just makes sure it adds to itself.

65
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.340
And then on the return value, you can drag off here and type add to viewport.

66
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.840
And that will add your example UMG to the screen.

67
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.640
Then when if we want to test it, we can test on the mobile preview.

68
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:48.740
So on platforms, which is at the top of your viewport here, you can just go to mobile preview and then you can play a new editor window.

69
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.240
And that will allow you to test whether the button is then clickable.

70
00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:02.240
To test deploying to the device, again, we can use this drop down here and we want to check that we've installed the SDK and Android Studio.

71
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.840
We want to make sure we ran the setup Android back at the top of the hands on section here.

72
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.140
And we want to make sure developer mode is unlocked on the device.

73
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.040
Compression between PC and HMI are different.

74
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.740
So just make sure you pay attention to that.

75
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.140
And then also it takes time to build and deploy.

76
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.340
So when you click and it's just compiling and doing its thing, don't worry, it can take time to do that.

77
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.240
You can run the Unreal Insights as we referenced previously if you want to test.

78
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.040
But you just need to make sure you install that first.

79
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.640
And so some packaging settings to use, you can choose whether you want the compressed cooked packages.

80
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.540
You want you want to exclude.

81
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.240
You can choose whether you want to exclude on any unnecessary content.

82
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.340
So maybe you only want to cook certain maps or have a list of some specific maps.

83
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.940
Do you want to make sure it's not for distribution?

84
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:06.940
Do you want to blueprint native eyes anything, which again is size versus speed as a trade off between performance?

85
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:16.640
And then do you want to do a full rebuild or do you just want to iterate through the build so that every time you package the game, it gets a little bit faster?

86
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.240
So here are a few options you may want to set for yourself inside your project settings.

87
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.440
And then lastly, talking about packaging, we can go to platforms at the top of the browser here.

88
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.940
You can go to Android and you can make sure that you have the Android ETC to set.

89
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.540
And for this instance, we probably want a development packaging build so we can test those debug settings.

90
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.640
We can do that four finger tap.

91
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.940
And this is essentially how we would go about packaging a project.

92
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.740
So you can click package.

93
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.640
Just know that that takes quite a while to go through.

94
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.040
But by the end of it, you should have a package deployed build on your Android device.

95
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.140
And you can then use it to debug any information you may want to see on the screen there.
