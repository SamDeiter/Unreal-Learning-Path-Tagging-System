00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
So thank you for being on the course today.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.400
Hopefully, it gave you a really good overview of the HMI pipeline,

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.640
which is more of a technical approach.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.640
There's a lot of documentation to dig into, discover.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.160
Hopefully, today you found some new tools that you didn't know about

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.440
inside of Unreal Engine to help you deploy your projects to Android devices

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.600
and make user interfaces and think about the design and the execution of these package projects.

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.800
So hopefully, it's given you a lot of information to take away

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
and start digging into, and we'll see you in the next course.
