1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
And that brings us to the end of this course today.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.439
Hopefully you learned a lot of information about V-Cams and how to set them up.

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.599
It was a little bit heavy with the technical setup at the start.

4
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.719
It's a very kind of step-by-step methodical processor.

5
00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:20.120
Hopefully once you've got it set up, you're kind of familiar with what everything does

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.440
and then the settings don't change too much so you can just next time jump straight into

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.760
using virtual camera.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
Without your scenes, use the different app functionalities to really help navigate and

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.600
scout the locations that you want to use.

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.800
And then when you actually start beginning the recording using take recorder or any other

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.160
powerful features of Unreal Engine, it allows you to really quickly record and iterate and

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.280
dial in those performances and then get them rendered out in sequencer.

13
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.520
So hopefully you learned a lot today and we'll see you on the next course.
