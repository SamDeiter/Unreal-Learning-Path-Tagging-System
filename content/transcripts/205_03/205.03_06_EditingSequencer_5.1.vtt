00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Now that we've got our performance captured and we understand the whole pipeline of using

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.880
the virtual camera, let's talk about how to edit our sequences within Sequencer.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
So a Sequencer allows for the trimming, editing and manipulation of keyframes and animation

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400
curves captured within the take recorder.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.960
So again, we've got all this data now captured from the live performance.

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.160
And now we can go in here and clean it up.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.960
So anything from the virtual camera moves to a rig inversion animation derived from

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960
recorded performance capture data.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.799
So the performance capture takes control rig animations, virtual camera movement, live

10
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.320
folly, anything that you added to the take recorder essentially will all be visible within

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.600
here and allows you to really dial in on the specific keys.

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.960
And you can open the curve editor as well using this button here.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.359
So that opens your curve editor, which is this larger window if you really want to dial

14
00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.679
in some of these keys.

15
00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.319
And then you can also finalize the recordings with the Sequencer editorial tools.

16
00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:13.079
So edit the recorded takes with the curve editor, save the takes as a new level sequence,

17
00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.719
and then the level sequences can be added as sub-scene tracks which we touched upon in

18
00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:18.719
previous courses.

19
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.400
There's documentation on the sub-scene tracks if you're unsure what they are and it allows

20
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.520
you to set camera binding ID in the camera cuts.

21
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.960
We can create sub-scene tracks in Sequencer.

22
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.480
We can add the V cam track in the timeline and then also adjust the shot duration for

23
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.160
the final edit.

24
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.280
So all of these can be edited within Sequencer.
