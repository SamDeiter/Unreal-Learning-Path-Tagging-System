00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.919
Let's get started setting up our virtual camera in Unreal Engine.

2
00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.839
First thing you'll need of course is a computer running Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.259
Next we'll need either an iPad Pro, which is recommended, but an iPhone X or later can

4
00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.960
also be used.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.080
And then you'll want the LiveLink Vcam app installed on your phone.

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.320
This is a free app in the iOS app store.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.719
You can also download the Unreal Remote 2 app as a backup in case you run into issues here,

8
00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.479
but hopefully will have success with the Vcam app.

9
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:39.039
Over in Unreal, we'll want to enable the virtual camera plugin, which by its nature will actually

10
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.920
activate the LiveLink and Pixel streaming plugins when you restart, but you're welcome to enable

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.439
those on your own as well.

12
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.519
Now in your actual Unreal Engine scene, you have two different choices.

13
00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.120
You can grab the Vcam actor, which is already set up to work with the Vcam app, or with

14
00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.559
your standard Cine Camera actor, say you've already got a camera with all the settings

15
00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.200
that you know you want to use, you can go ahead and add that Vcam component to get started

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.599
in the same way.

17
00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:15.400
What we like about the Vcam actor is it already has the user interface that will be demonstrating

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.319
setup.

19
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.519
In either case, in order to access the details of our Vcam, we will actually have to navigate

20
00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:29.239
down the hierarchy of our actor down to the Vcam PS for Pixel streaming component.

21
00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:33.879
And this is where we will do things like set up our LiveLink subject to be our Vcam Pixel

22
00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:35.519
streaming session.

23
00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:40.719
A few of the standard setup elements once you've selected your Vcam component would be to hit

24
00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.199
the checkbox to enable it.

25
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:47.599
If you have an active session, the LiveLink subject should automatically populate as your

26
00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.359
Pixel streaming session.

27
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.799
And then you'll also want to hit the checkbox for lock viewport to camera to keep our Vcam

28
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.120
session active inside of the viewport.

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.480
Under output, you might already see UMG overlay populated, but this is where you could select

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.960
a different user interface besides the default one that we'll be reviewing.

31
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.240
Over on your mobile device, this is what you should see when the app boots up.

32
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.280
And here we are going to want to input our IPv4 address.

33
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.560
This can be found by opening your command prompt and typing an IP config or clicking

34
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.639
the drop down in your Pixel streaming menu in your viewport.

35
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.319
You'll also want to make sure that in the settings for the app that you have selected

36
00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.960
Pixel streaming and not remote session.

37
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.080
At that point, if you hit connect, you should see a connection form between your computer

38
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.920
and your mobile device.

39
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.639
And you should see both your viewport in Unreal Engine and your mobile device screen matching

40
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.039
complete with the selected UMG.

41
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:54.039
Note that it may be necessary to uncheck and recheck the is active option in the output

42
00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.079
tab in order for the app to begin tracking.

43
00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.779
And if Pixel streaming does cause you any issues, you can set up a remote session either

44
00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.519
with a Vcam app or with the Unreal Remote 2 app.

45
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.719
Similarly, you would enter your IPv4 address here and press connect.

46
00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.919
If you have any issues, we have some troubleshooting steps.

47
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.419
First of all, make sure the virtual camera live link plugins as well as either the Pixel

48
00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.439
streaming and or the remote session plugin are all enabled.

49
00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.239
Next, make sure your iOS device and computer are directly connected to each other and sure

50
00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.639
they're on the same Wi-Fi connection.

51
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.599
Make sure you're not using a signal repeater to confirm verify that both your iOS device

52
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.599
and computer are on the same public IP and you can do this by googling what's my IP to

53
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.039
get your public IP address.

54
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.319
And here's what I mentioned about using IP config in order to find your IPv4 address.

55
00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.239
If you're connected to multiple networks, make sure you're looking at the right one.

56
00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.519
For example, if you are connected to Ethernet, look for Ethernet.

57
00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.280
And if you're connected to a wireless network, look for wireless.

58
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.579
Next verify that both devices are on the same subnet.

59
00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.840
You will often notice a difference between something like a 192 subnet versus a 10.subnet.

60
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.759
So make sure, for example, that both your iOS device and your computer start with, for

61
00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.079
example, 192.

62
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.840
And lastly, just verify that you did type in the correct IPv4 address inside the iOS

63
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.360
app.

64
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.959
If you do want to explore connecting via a remote session, there might be some additional

65
00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:35.259
settings you have to configure in your project settings, plugins, UDP messaging.

66
00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.800
You'll want to make sure that you find that IPv4 address and a few more troubleshooting

67
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
steps.

68
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480
Make sure only one instance of Unreal is open.

69
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.639
Try disabling your firewall.

70
00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.600
Try whitelisting devices and checking your firewall rules.

71
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.160
Verify that the app is on and actively capturing data.

72
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.920
And then my last and favorite step for all things broken, just try resetting or restarting

73
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.920
all devices involved and try again.

74
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.120
If you do not have access to an iOS device, there is a third party app made by By Owls.

75
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.519
A stripped down version similar to the Vcam plugin and it is available in the Epic Games

76
00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.160
marketplace.

77
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.519
Just note that it is not free.

78
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.319
Next up, we'll take a look at the virtual camera's user interface.
