00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
Hi, this is Alex Coulomb, and now we're going to take everything Pete has shown in the previous

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.040
course sections and apply them to create replacement footage for our level sequence.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
So to get started with the VCam application in Unreal, you're going to want to make sure

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.440
you have a few plugins on.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.019
One will be your virtual cam.

6
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.039
One will be pixel streaming.

7
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.560
And the final one will be Live Link.

8
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.920
Once those are enabled and you've restarted, all you'll have to do is activate pixel streaming

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.039
in the dropdown here.

10
00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.159
You can just say launch signaling server.

11
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.159
And once that's active, you're going to want to take note of your IPv4 address there, the

12
00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.759
local one, because we'll put that into the app in a moment.

13
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.799
We can also go ahead and just grab in our VCam actor, which you can also find under the plus

14
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.159
virtual production and VCam actor right there.

15
00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.039
And once you have this activated, you might just want to tilt it slightly toward the person

16
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.359
you plan on capturing, bring it up a little higher if you want to.

17
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.759
And then what we're going to do is go under the component for the VCam actor, the one

18
00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.439
called VCam.

19
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.439
And under here, we're going to want to make sure this is enabled, which will activate this

20
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.679
nice little UI.

21
00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.039
And then we can close place actors to give us a little more screen real estate and go

22
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.920
to window virtual production live link.

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.920
And we can see that right now I've got a yellow colored icon here telling me that the VCam

24
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.960
app is detected, but it's not actually active right now.

25
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.080
So over on my iPhone, what I'll now do is go over to pixel streaming and again see 192.168.1.6.

26
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.200
And I will match that over here on my iPhone.

27
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.519
Don't worry about the port.

28
00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:58.799
And I'll just hit connect or go.

29
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.320
And if it doesn't connect, make sure under settings you go and change your connection

30
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.400
type to pixel streaming.

31
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400
That's key.

32
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.480
And let's try one more time, connect.

33
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.560
And it says it wants to use our microphone and right away we can see it spring to life.

34
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm going to press OK for our tracking here.

35
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.840
And we can see we're now matching up our viewport and what we see in editor.

36
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.719
We've got a green light over here.

37
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:28.639
I can click on the UI elements directly in my viewport or use my finger inside the browser.

38
00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.800
And I can start to actually move around my space.

39
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.680
And I can even walk around physically to get exactly the view I want before hitting record

40
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.840
to actually create a take.

41
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.840
So to start here, I am just walking around just giving a sense of a one to one relationship

42
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.079
between my real space and the virtual one.

43
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.360
And up, looks like I just lost my connection there.

44
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.880
Worth demonstrating.

45
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.760
And if you disconnect like what just happened to me, just make sure you go back into your

46
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.880
live link subject settings and just reconnect.

47
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.439
And here I am just walking around again.

48
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:21.199
And I just tried hitting the record button to show you that you can actually activate

49
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.479
recording a take directly from the app.

50
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.479
Short one there.

51
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:34.199
We'll review that in a bit.

52
00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.639
And just demonstrating some of the wheels we have here for changing ISO and a number of

53
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:49.519
other settings that will look familiar to anyone who's ever operated a camera before.

54
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.599
Also note that we can move the camera around just using our fingers.

55
00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.719
What registers as our right thumb will be rotation just along the Z axis.

56
00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:07.759
And if we manage to get our left hand into there, that starts to register as your movement

57
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.919
on the X and Y axis.

58
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.120
And here's what it looks like if you are too close to a wall in your real space, you just

59
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.279
have to back up a little to find the floor again.

60
00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.360
Couple other things in here.

61
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.240
If we hit this, we'll actually lock our augmented reality camera if we wanted to focus more on

62
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.079
some other manual settings or if we found a static view we want to keep.

63
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:44.759
And here we are with that left and right navigation that's manual.

64
00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.720
And we're going to fly mode right now.

65
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.960
So now we're also able to navigate on the Z axis.

66
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.360
And here we are just recording another take.

67
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.879
And then we just tap that record button again when we're all done.

68
00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.080
And when you're all done recording, you can just go ahead and uncheck that enabled setting

69
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.360
on the virtual camera.

70
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.680
And if we'd like, we can even take a look at some of the recordings we just got.

71
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.240
With take recorder, we can say review the last recording and lock to that camera cut

72
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.199
view and we can see whatever we've done.

73
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:36.199
Let's take a look at a couple others over in cinematics takes today's date.

74
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.480
And we can also see the one we made over here.

75
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.800
And you get a nice natural handheld camera effect.

76
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.079
So we'll see if we can use this one to replace one of the shots in our finished film.

77
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:54.680
So to find that, I'll start by searching for anything called film because that's the name

78
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.439
of these final sequences.

79
00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.199
And we'll see that there is one here in 205.03 that says V cam drop.

80
00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.160
So I'll open up this one to actually put our V cam file inside.

81
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.000
And so let's just review what we have in here at the moment.

82
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.759
So we'll lock to the viewport and we see we've got our pan up.

83
00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.800
And you know what, right there, that's probably a good spot for our little shaky cam shot

84
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.199
because feels a little bit strange to suddenly have the camera move like that.

85
00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.240
So maybe we can cut in right there.

86
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.639
I was going to scroll through the rest and see if there's anywhere else.

87
00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.400
We might want to use our little shaky cam shot, but I like it over here.

88
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.680
So I'm going to double click on here and we'll see that we have a subsequence with additional

89
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.920
shots.

90
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.840
So I like this first shot as is.

91
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.160
And the second one right before that camera moves, that's where I'm going to try to insert

92
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.240
my V cam footage.

93
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.240
Now the tricky thing is my V cam footage did not record the animation that we have for

94
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.879
our mannequin in here.

95
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.519
So in order to have that come in correctly, we are going to want to copy that mannequin

96
00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.519
data.

97
00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:04.560
So I'll just grab that whole mannequin object with its animation and do control seed.

98
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.920
And now I'm just going to insert my V cam shot, which as we might recall is the one that

99
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.800
we called scene underscore one underscore O two.

100
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.600
We could certainly give that a better name.

101
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.199
This is fine for now.

102
00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.079
And we'll actually drop it into its own track entirely down here.

103
00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:26.279
If we wanted to actually overwrite what we have up here, maybe we can just snap it like

104
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:30.519
that because then we can actually leave the existing shot here for the moment.

105
00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.719
And this one will be on top of it.

106
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:33.719
So there's the shot.

107
00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:37.719
But of course you see we do not have our mannequin there.

108
00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:41.799
So if we want to get our mannequin in, the easiest thing to do will now be to open up

109
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:47.240
in here and to paste in our mannequin with control V.

110
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.839
But then we get a message saying the sequences read only.

111
00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:55.159
So be sure to go to the upper right and unlock it and we'll try again.

112
00:07:55.159 --> 00:08:00.119
And then you might find that there's no animation here because of where the time scale is.

113
00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:05.679
We're starting in a different time code here, but that can easily be fixed by going up to

114
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:15.719
here and grabbing the actual animation from here from Manny animation track.

115
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.760
And we will paste it manually into here.

116
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.480
And just drag that back to the beginning.

117
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.760
Now because of the alignment we have over here right now, we will want to make sure that

118
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.760
we're matching that.

119
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:37.120
So we'll actually snap to the beginning and you'll see that now we are aligning.

120
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.720
So we've got the head coming up right there.

121
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.480
And you'll see that if I were to disable this, uncheck active, we see that the hand is an

122
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.159
exactly the same spot.

123
00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:54.639
But maybe we like the beginning of what we had there.

124
00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:59.200
So we could kind of cut and choose where we want to keep the old animation.

125
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.960
So maybe right before that camera starts to move, like right as the hand is coming up,

126
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.560
that's where we use it.

127
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.639
A little bit of confusion.

128
00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:14.200
And then maybe we cut it off right before that shrug.

129
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.920
So right about here.

130
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.879
So one more time.

131
00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:25.720
Original new shaky cam, confusion, and there's a shrug.

132
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.240
And then everything plays on as normal.

133
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.879
So at that point, if we wanted to, we could start to clip this more.

134
00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:39.759
I could use my shortcut control forward slash and start to pull this apart.

135
00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:44.200
Or just remind myself that this is continuous and leave that on top.

136
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.519
Depends how you want to do it.

137
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:54.439
But there's our easy insert of our V cam shot into the larger sequence.

138
00:09:54.439 --> 00:09:56.480
That's it for the practical application.

139
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.120
And in the next section, Pete will review what we've done so far.
