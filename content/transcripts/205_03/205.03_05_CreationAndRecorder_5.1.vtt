00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
Just doing a quick recap of the take creation with take recorder just to make sure you're

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.820
familiar with the tool and that you have access to it in your projects.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.240
So a take recorder enables you to quickly record and iteratively create sequences inside

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.640
of Unreal Engine.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.879
So takes can be created for virtual cameras, body and facial performances, you can even

6
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.240
catch in Niagara or vehicle animation.

7
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.439
When it comes to vehicle animation or blueprints and more, you can have in previous courses

8
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:39.799
we referred to them as possessible actors, you could be controlling a character in a

9
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.000
game like situation.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.439
Have take recorder enabled and be recording the movement, the running around, the jumping,

11
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.000
whatever you might be doing.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.480
And then that bakes it down into its individual animation sequence, which can be played back.

13
00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:01.159
So if you want a very game, game like feel to a performance, for example, you can record

14
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.560
that with a keyboard and mouse or gamepad and then play that back with the take recorder,

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.039
which is a really powerful tool.

16
00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.719
It saves a lot of iteration time.

17
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:17.479
And then recordings can also be taken iteratively with one or multiple actors added into a sequence.

18
00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.359
So here's a UI for the take recorder.

19
00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.640
There is documentation on the take recorder if you'd like to get a deeper look.

20
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.640
But essentially, here's a high level of the user interface, which you can dig into.

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.519
And you can pause the video if you want to really figure out what each of those options

22
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.280
does.

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.799
Then we also have the settings here.

24
00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.079
So you can add access to the sources by dragging from the world outliner.

25
00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.560
So you can just drag and drop them into the take recorder, or you can use the source panel

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
here up here.

27
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.320
You can just click source from actor and then add a specific actor.

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.799
Make sure to change the record type to the appropriate settings and then select play

29
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920
and then record in the take recorder.

30
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.799
And then recording is displayed in real time.

31
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.400
So when you are finished, click stop on the recording, and then that will save your animation.

32
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.960
So it's a pretty straightforward tool to use.

33
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.159
Again, we've got documentation down here.

34
00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.560
A few notes as well is that take recorder allows users to specify which actor properties

35
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.879
can be recorded.

36
00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.280
So if you've selected the meerkat as in this example, you could remove any data that you

37
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.599
don't necessarily need.

38
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.079
Again, it's sometimes good to record all the data that you're not sure you might need for

39
00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.960
editing later down the line.

40
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.079
But if there's data that you just definitely don't need, sometimes it's easier to just

41
00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.079
disable that.

42
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.120
So it just cleans up that sequence a little bit more and you're not dealing with as many

43
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120
properties.

44
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.740
And then the last note is that you can record as many takes as you need by repeating the

45
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.360
process or using the existing take as a basic template to combine performances into that

46
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.180
single file and then each individual take is saved into a sub folder.

47
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.480
So again, documentation is there if you'd like a deeper dive on the take recorder.
