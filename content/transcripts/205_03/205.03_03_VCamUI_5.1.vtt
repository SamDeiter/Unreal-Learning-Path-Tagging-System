1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
Next, let's take a look at the user interface for the LiveLink V-CAM to better understand

2
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.439
some of the options available to us as we start to use this interface.

3
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:16.500
Now the interface will look different depending on whether you're using say an iPad or an

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.219
iPhone, but the core features will be all here.

5
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:25.280
So some of the elements we have available to us include the application log, kind of

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.539
your standard output log in Unreal to the device system stats, which will include things

7
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.939
like our aspect ratio and our bit rate and our time code.

8
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.439
We'll see the ability to disconnect from the session and go back into our standard Unreal

9
00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.679
Engine editor.

10
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.200
We can see our camera stats, in this case 18 millimeters, and a 16 by 9 aspect ratio

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
also translated as 1.778.

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Over here we can see our aperture stats including our ISO, which is set to auto, a focal distance

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.219
of 1000 meters, and an f-stop of 2.8.

14
00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.180
The little camera icon over here will tab out to give us additional camera settings,

15
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.740
similarly with tools over on the right side.

16
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.020
And for 9 and 10, we have a virtual joystick system not unlike the default touch interface

17
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859
that you'll see when developing a mobile game.

18
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.099
This is set up so that the left joystick will move us on the XY axis and the right

19
00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.180
joystick will be for boom and pan.

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.819
We'll see this in action in the next lesson.

21
00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.939
A few other elements to take note of, we have of course our viewfinder in the middle.

22
00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.579
We have the ability to add bookmarks if we would like to snap easily to different camera

23
00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.359
points in our bookmark manager.

24
00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.420
We have our playback controls, which will look familiar to anyone who has used the sequencer

25
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.500
or cinematic viewport, although with the touch interface we can actually scrub our finger

26
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.780
along here to also move forward or backward in time.

27
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.540
15 is our record button, very much like the take recorder.

28
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.140
16 shows our axis scale, more about that on the next slide, and our stabilization stats.

29
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.699
We can tune this up or down depending on how much camera shake we want to have.

30
00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.139
We have our tilt pan and roll degrees just to get a sense of the current rotation of

31
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.379
our camera.

32
00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.859
And lastly over here we have the name of our slate and the sequence frame that we are currently

33
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:22.979
on.

34
00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.780
More information as always can be found in the Unreal Engine documentation.

35
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.900
Here we see some of the additional options we're presented with when we open up our camera

36
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.539
toolbar as well as our tools toolbar.

37
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:40.460
Axis scaling is very similar to the world to meters scale setup for anyone who's worked

38
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.900
in virtual reality because this allows you to essentially change how your physical movement

39
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.939
will translate from the real world into this virtual world.

40
00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.780
If you want to be able to cover a lot of ground very quickly by moving your iPad around and

41
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.300
using the AR features to cover more territory, you can dial up the axis scale to be able

42
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.659
to cover more ground, or if you would like more subtle movements, you can bring that

43
00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.659
down.

44
00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.500
You can also set the value to zero in order to lock and play with dialing these up or

45
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.540
down with your fingers on the left and right side.

46
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.659
So we have the axis scale on the left and the joystick movement gain, joystick rotation

47
00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.579
gain over on the right.

48
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.659
Over here we see some of the dials that give us additional access to our camera controls.

49
00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.819
So our lens control for a lens preset on the inner dial and the focal length on the outer

50
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.819
dial.

51
00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.459
We have the right dial allowing us to adjust our f-stop as the inner dial and our focal

52
00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.500
distance as the outer dial.

53
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.259
And then over here we have our film back control to select any presets we might have like

54
00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.699
16 by 9 for example or other aspect ratios.

55
00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.060
Continuing down here we have the ability to adjust our ISO and exposure control and then

56
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.219
we also have our f-stop out here.

57
00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.259
On the right here we have our exposure compensation so we can dial the perceived brightness of

58
00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.060
the world up and down.

59
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.259
Here allows us to adjust our near clip plane depending on how close we want to be able

60
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:11.139
to get to objects before they start to clip out of existence.

61
00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.419
A couple more key features to draw your attention to include the reposition button which basically

62
00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.939
allows you to lock the camera in one spot and then you can physically move in the real

63
00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.060
world without changing that position.

64
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.939
This is great if you are restricted in your physical movement but actually want to cover

65
00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.019
a larger space.

66
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.060
Same idea can be done with tilt.

67
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.740
For example if you want to have a very severe Dutch angle that might be harder to achieve

68
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.139
in the real world and you need to dial up that rotation depending on your physical movement

69
00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.220
or just get yourself in a more comfortable physical position while having a potentially

70
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.220
more extreme angle.

71
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.780
Next up we'll look at filming a shot with the Vcam and then insert that shot into an

72
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.220
existing sequence.
