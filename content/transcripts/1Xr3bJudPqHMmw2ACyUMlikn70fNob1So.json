  "text": " So replication, this is a concept that isn't particularly unique to Unreal. Obviously every online engine, every online game would have some kind of concept for data going from the server to the client, but replication in Unreal is kind of worth talking about because it's got a lot of unique components that are kind of like probably more Unreal only. So what actually is replication? The term might be interchangeable, might be called other things, but replication is basically the process of data going from the server to the client and it gives server authority over client side variables and essentially what the server will do is frequently check for whether or not the information that the client has matches what's on the server. So networked actors have a kind of a net update frequency and this is used to determine how often an actor replicates, so how often we make these checks and the server will keep a kind of shadow set of data. So that's the server as well as the server having the actual data for what the value actually is, it will keep a kind of copy for what the last thing is sent to each client was and the server is going to compare that shadow data against its current set of values and if there's a kind of mismatch, so if it's to say oh this is this data is clearly changed from what I last sent to the client, then it knows that it's going to need to kind of like send some information down to the client to bring them kind of back up to date with what the server's current ID of everything is. Obviously this check comes with an inherent kind of network cost, so there are things we can definitely do to kind of reduce that cost and maybe not be making that check quite as often. The cheapest one to do is updating our net update frequency, which is essentially a little bit like reducing your tick time almost, we've talked about doing that before as a way to kind of optimize your tick. You can basically just check for replication less frequency and that's through our net update frequency on a per actor basis. I think we may get into this a little bit later but it's something we've talked about before as well is that actor is our kind of like main point for dealing with replication whilst components can be replicated to actors, our kind of central entry point. So a lot of this stuff is stuff that a lot of these networked concepts that we talk about would be stuff that we do handle on the actor itself. Net update frequency is actually an example of that, in fact you can just quickly jump into the engine. I'm in the level blueprint here but level blueprint is actually an actor so this should be here, update frequency, yeah, net update frequency, you can see it's there, this would be available in any actor. So yeah, that's one of the quickest ways to kind of update this, the quickest ways to kind of like make your game more net performant is looking at your net frequency, net update frequency is one of the lowest hanging fruits. It just comes back to that kind of, and a lot of this kind of network logic is really just about that, it's that kind of same core tenet of really all code optimisation is that doing something less is better, the less you can do something the better. One of the kind of important things to bear in mind when we're talking about replication, one of the things that's often forgotten is that people can enjoy, depending on your game setup obviously, it's often a problem you hit up against that people can join your game mid-session and so it's worth considering how you are passing data around such that you maintain some kind of, all the information that is stateful isn't purely replicated through like function calls, isn't just oh this information has changed and therefore I'll just let everyone who's currently connected know that you maintain some kind of persistent state for all of the bits of information you care about and therefore when a new player possibly joins ten minutes into your game they get all the bits of information they actually need and they don't get some kind of smaller subset where you've got a mismatch between players that were here for this initial bit of information getting broadcast out and then the players who join afterwards who kind of missed that. So what can be replicated? Essentially, Unreal provides a lot of data types that can be replicated out of the box. The vast majority of data types are replicated but some are completely not and others require a little bit of nuance and kind of understanding about how they actually work. So straight off the bat, our atomic types are kind of fundamental types, bools, ints, floats, all of these are going to be replicated. Unreal also supports struct replication as long as the information in those structs are one of these types that are already replicated. It's worth mentioning that when we're dealing with structs as a kind of efficiency thing, if you are changing information in a struct you don't need to change the overall struct. We'll get into this a little bit and I've got a kind of example that shows this right at the end of the presentation but you can change individual bits of information in a struct and Unreal will understand that it's only that bit of information that has changed and therefore only send that unique bit of information within the struct over to the client or if you're communicating that data back to the server somehow, the same way. So you don't have to make a change to the whole struct to say oh this will get replicated. If a struct is replicated and you only change one member within that struct, it is only that member that will get passed over to the other clients. Enums, obviously even though they are specialized types, they are under the surface, they are really a Uint8 and so they will be sent over the network just as an atomic type really. Arrays are also supported and they're kind of smart things done about arrays where if you make an overall change to an array then it's your first time, then the whole array will be copied over but if you make changes to entry to elements within an array or you add a single element, it's only those individual changes that will get replicated over to the clients. So again there's a kind of an efficiency that is already being done for you so you don't need to be super clever with these things. It's worth mentioning though that when you are doing, we've not talked about RPCs yet, that when you are doing RPCs and you're passing RPCs with arrays and you're passing an array in as a parameter of that RPC, the whole array will be copied over and you can't avoid that. Just kind of a kind of anti-optimization that's worth bearing in mind. As with a lot of T-Maps, they're unfortunately a little bit underrepresented in a lot of different aspects and replication is one of those. So if you kind of want T-Map functionality, one of the easy things that you can do for anyone who's not familiar with the term map, there might be other terms you have used for this, but this is essentially the idea that you have a container, a type that contains multiple entries, but rather than being represented by an index like an array, it's represented by a key type. So you give it some kind of type that represents a unique value and then it maps to a value. So it's otherwise called key value pairs. And if you need that kind of map-like functionality but you want it to be replicated, you can do it via an array and if you override your functionality to have an equality operator check, then you can easily kind of find within that array. There are performance differences obviously, but you get a lot of that same functionality and you can also use indexOf by key or find by key, even if you don't want to do a direct struct to struct comparison or value to value comparison, you can use key types. So just be aware that there are kind of like ways around that for usage purposes, but obviously there is a kind of meaningful performance differences between a map and an array. So you know it's not a perfect replication is not the right word to use there, but it's not a one-to-one relationship, but you can get a lot of the way there. To all intents and purposes, pointers are supported for replication in a sense, but the pointers that are replicated are only pointers to objects that are themselves replicated. So you kind of need to have a knowledge of all the data in your game that is replicated to know whether or not the object that you're talking about is going to be kind of valid to be replicated itself. Essentially when objects are replicated they are kind of given a unique ID and that unique ID is itself replicated from server to client, so it is consistent between the two and therefore when you're passing a pointer around actually what gets replicated over the server is that unique ID and therefore it's easy for your client to then rebuild that same connection and be like oh they've passed in this unique ID, I know what object has that unique ID and therefore I'll hook that up on my local side. So that's how it works and therefore pointers do work, they can be replicated, but only pointers to objects that are themselves replicated. So how do we even make something replicated? We've talked about kind of what replication itself means, but how do we actually do this? So there is essentially just a variable inside actors. Like I said, actors are our kind of key entry point for all of our kind of replication logic and there is essentially just a bool that represents whether or not an actor is replicated. If you just go to your actor, there is a replicates, I think it's called, yeah, replicates and this can be true or false by default. You can also set it at runtime through a function called set replicates. There are going to be certain consequences to that. It's not necessarily advisable that you update these things at runtime because there's probably going to be a lot of kind of weird consequences of that. So the vast majority of the time you should be doing it within the body of the, if you are going to be doing set replicates true, if you are going to be calling that function, you should probably be doing that inside your constructor. But you know, there probably are kind of workarounds where you could hypothetically hack into that and replicate that replicatedness over the server, but that would be a little bit weird. The vast majority of the time an actor should, this should be true if an actor ever replicates and false if not. And that's basically our starting point for whether or not this thing can, you know, none of the rest of this is relevant if the actor is not itself relevant. And also with a component, we have a similar variable and similarly we've got that function should be done within the constructor. If a component replicates is not on an actor that replicates, then it's completely irrelevant. Components can only be replicated when they are on an actor that replicates. And then once something is replicated, then that just means that this thing can make use of replication functionality, but there are additional steps that we have to take whenever we actually want to mark something as replicatable. So first off, if it's data, typically when we're talking about replication, we're talking about like actual variable replication and that is we would have to have types that can be marked up with a U property. So we know what this means from previous sessions that you can only mark something up as a U property if it's inside either a U struct or a U class as we've spoken about. So all of this is only applies to anything that inherits, is part of the U object hierarchy chain. And you would just add, if you just want data that is replicated from server to client, you would just put the replicated markup above it. And the other option is replicated using, which basically gives us replication, but with additional callbacks. So with replicated using, what you do is you, this is essentially saying this data does get replicated from server to client, but additionally to that, there is a function that will be called and here is what that function is called. The name does matter, I'll go into this in a little bit, but it does need this onRep underscore is a kind of requirement. But then what you call the function after that is kind of completely up to you. It doesn't have to have any correlation with the actual data that you're replicating. It's worth noting that data won't be replicated if it's the same, if it's already, if you make a change on the server and it's not changed from what the client thinks, then that information is not going to get replicated over. So it's worth bearing that in mind in the context of onRep, if you're relying on your onRep function to get called, but you haven't actually changed the data that's not going to change anything. It's also worth mentioning that if you are relying on your onRep functions getting called, if you are in single player and I believe also on your listen server, then your onRep functions won't necessarily get called. So you kind of need to account for that. On replication is only really for when data is getting passed from the server to a client. So when you're in standalone, that relationship kind of isn't there and therefore your onRep functions won't be getting called. So you need to account for that and possibly develop alternative avenues if your game is a game that can be played both single player and multiplayer and you're relying on this onRep functionality. The other thing that you will need to do is put any variables. So replicated and replicated using are not enough on their own. You also have this function which is getLifetimeReplicatedProperties and you basically need to pass in some macros to essentially say this is data that will get replicated and you're essentially going to be passing in the same variables that you've put replication markup above. You're going to pass in the name of the class that this is within and then the name of the variable itself. I've not actually spent a huge amount of time looking into the macro itself, but I suspect what this is doing. There are other parts of the engine that do this. I suspect that this is doing a compile time checking just to make sure that you've spelt this name correctly and therefore if this is called somevar and then you just make an editor change and you change that to somevar2, I suspect it's going to be a compile time check so the compiler will complain at you to say hey you've not correctly renamed this. There's no variable called somevar anymore so you need to update that. There are alternative options as well. It's not just the doReplifetime macro, there is an additional one called doReplifetime. There are a couple of actually but the other one that's worth bearing in mind is the doRepLifetimeCondition which lets us specify some additional parameters where this should only replicate across the client in certain situations. We've actually got an example so we'll come to kind of the reason I've actually made this is for demoing a couple of other I'm sorry jumping to the wrong actor there demoing this for a couple of different reasons and we'll kind of get towards this at the very end of the session but just kind of show some of this in situ and as you can see we've got a float here this is inside a U class obviously again we can't have U properties if it's not inside either a U struct or a U class so we have an actor here I'll actually demo this actor like I said at the end of the session but we've got a variable here I wanted to replicate this variable therefore I have to do a U property markup above it I have to say it's replicated and then that alone is not enough I have to make sure that that is inside an actor that is replicated or a component that is replicated on an actor that is replicated and so you can see if I jump to my constructor for my actor you can see I've done all the relevant things we'll talk about relevancy in a moment but you can see that in the constructor we've said you know this actor replicates and the other thing we've done is added saying I do rep lifetime we've passed in our actor class and we've passed in the variable name so some replicated float all of that are the things that you need to do to make sure that this variable will actually get replicated and then here we have we're making use of this on rep this rep using so you don't need to say replicated and rep using rep using can be done it inherently implies that this value is replicated and then you pass in the function that will actually get called when this value gets replicated too so this again the name here doesn't have any bearing on the actual data that's replicated you're just saying this function will get called when this value gets replicated into but the on rep is important so this function is just down here it is important that this function is a u function if it isn't a u function it won't get properly found this is all using the unreal reflection system so this function has to be a u function and similarly you can see that you know with inside that function we don't need to go into great detail about this but we're just basically printing a string so when this value gets updated and replicated onto the client that value we're going to do some printing and similarly we have to do for replicated using values as well as replicated values we have to add them to this get lifetime replicated props you also want to be sure that you call your super function here because there's going to be data further down the chain that is also replicated so you don't want to forget to call that so that the parent class functions are getting called and then here we've got this example of the do reply time condition this condition there's a whole suite of these that you can kind of look at but so you can kind of jump into core net types dot h and look at those but the example that I've given is this this particular type the some replicated struct variable we've marked it to only get replicated for simulated actors we'll talk about what that kind of meaning is but it essentially means that on the owning on the person on the the connection on the client that actually owns this actor i.e. for the case of a pawn that you know the the client that is actually controlling this pawn this data won't get replicated to them so this particular condition is one that you might use if it's data that you know will actually kind of come from the client so say for example your client is making local changes to their customization so they've changed what hat they're wearing and they make that change locally on their client and then replicate that data to the server therefore that might be data that the server doesn't need to replicate back to the client because they know the client for through other alternative means will have the the most up-to-date idea of that information and therefore they only need to replicate it to the to the clients that aren't owning this actor itself that's just an example of the kind of condition you might want to place on your variables when they get replicated otherwise this is basically saying replicate this data to all clients whenever you know they pass other checks that we'll get to in a little bit the other thing to bear in mind with any you know passing data from the server to the client is it takes time obviously these things aren't instantaneous when testing sometimes it can feel that way but you know depending on how far away your your server is from your client and depending on the internet speed you could be talking you know fractional seconds you could be talking multiple seconds so do bear that in mind don't rely on things being instantaneous because they are not so when we're talking about function calls we've talked about the idea of passing data over replicated data but we also have rpcs rpcs are a term that is not necessarily unique to unreal this is something that exists in you know other engines i think it's a kind of general term but if you're not familiar with it rpc stands for remote procedure call it's essentially a little bit like a function that you send over the network so we can there's a couple of different this is rpcs aren't one thing it's kind of a whole subset of things we can send we can do a function call from we can go from a client to a server we can go from a client the server to a specific client as long as we are calling our that function on an object that's ultimately owned by a particular client each player controller as we kind of all the way back here we kind of said we've got this relationship where the server has every player controller and then every client has their own player controller and no one else is so that's as i said this kind of one-to-one unique connection that each client has with the server so that's where this kind of comes in here is that when we're doing kind of client function calls that is those are to be done on objects that they're only going to get called on that unique player controller so each player controller kind of represents that unique connection between the the client and it's and the controlling server so when a client is communicating information back to the server they can only do it through their player controller and obviously they can only do it about objects that they are the owner for and then we have this kind of third type so we have you know client to server obviously that can only be done on objects that the client owns server to client that's with the intention that we're kind of communicating that information to an individual client also through their player controller and then we have this kind of net multicast this is a little bit we talked about delegates i believe in our second session we have the idea of multicast delegates so that's the kind of information that is just broadcast everywhere it's the same kind of concept here and this is basically a function where the sir it's it's not from client to server it's only of a server to client and this is a kind of shotgun function that broadcasts to every single client and it therefore require no player controller because they're just going to let every client know about this so the way that we would do this is similar to how we had to do u property markup with replication for our rpcs we have u function markup so this implies certain things right we for a function to be a an rpc it has to be a u function and for u functions to exist they have to exist within a u struct or a u class so all of that logic or all kind of bubbles down and yeah we can specify one of those those three configurations we can specify if it's a client server or a net multicast the other thing that we can mark up is whether or not a function is reliable or unreliable so yeah in the in the context of this again is not necessarily unique to unreal but reliable functions are essentially functions that you can trust will always make their way to to the client they may not necessarily get that instantaneously they may take time if the client has some kind of package loss or if their connection gets disrupted it might take some quite a bit of time and unreliable functions are essentially functions that you know due to packet loss due to connection problems there may be a kind of like essentially this function might get lost so you need to kind of bear that in mind when your marking functions is reliable or unreliable reliable functions aren't just magically you know the temptation can just be to mark every function as reliable but actually the the general advice is to make as many things unreliable as possible only the absolute most key functions to make reliable and that's because reliable kind of has extra cost when functions are marked as reliable they kind of enter a queue and they kind of maintain both on the server and you know it's almost like it maintains that shadow set of data to make sure that this data does actually make its way to the client so they are more expensive to both call and maintain so therefore if a function can be unreliable it should be unreliable but you just have to kind of understand that that you know there is a world where that function never makes its way to to the kind of receiving client if if there are connection problems or anything like that the other thing that could kind of bear in mind is that we can we've also got this capability for validation so validation is an additional markup that we can do on the on the rpc and essentially it lets us specify kind of an additional set of data so with validation as when we specified on rep what that means is we can kind of add some additional function that will return either true or false and this is basically a way of primarily for things like cheat detection and if it's if we return true then it was validated if we return false then essentially the the server will instantly kick this connection so typically you you know you want to be returning true you don't want to be kicking everyone off your connection but it's there for if we imagine we have an rpc that the client can tell the server they've reloaded their clip and this is the amount of ammo they reloaded you could do some kind of simple check for whether or not the the amount that they're trying to reload by is even a sane amount that could ever possibly be reloaded and if not you know maybe you can only ever reload one bullet at a time or you know what the maximum clip size clicks yeah clip size is for their gun if they're trying to reload some kind of bogus amount then that's like an example of how you could you know use some kind of gameplay data to validate against and therefore you can assume that they're cheating if not and then they'll get kicked off so that validation unlike our rpc when we do with validation that we don't specify a unique function name we simply have our our existing function name and we will basically have additional markup so for anyone who's used to doing delegates it would look the same way you have the the function that you actually say hey this this function is you know is a is an rpc and it would look like this here's its kind of signature here's its name here's the parameters it takes in then when you actually do the implementation for that in your in your c++ it would look like this so you you don't necessarily have to declare this in the header but in your body it would look like this your the the kind of actual header element of this should kind of get automatically generated for you if for some reason you wanted that to be a virtual function you would probably need to declare that in your header as a virtual version of the same function but otherwise the the kind of in the header that will already exist but it's only in the body you would need to do your function name underscore implementation and this is the thing that would actually get called when the rpc kind of filters through to the client and then you would just do whatever you wanted your game logic to do in here and then last of all we have the validate and the same thing it's whatever your your function is called underscore validate and then this would be have to be a bool function that returns either true or false and again if this returns true then it's pass validation if it returns false then that connection is going to get kicked so be very careful when you're returning false yeah i think that's everything to kind of say about our kind of core markup so as we said already we have kind of three ways of marking a function up we can mark it up as server client or multicast when it's a server that means it's called from the client to the server so this is the client communicating data to the server this should only be called on objects this is essentially all through the these first two are all through the player controller so this should only be called on objects that are owned by a particular player controller so you know an example would be your the pawn that player is currently controlling they are owned by that player controller and therefore they are owned by that connection so that's the client communication information to the server that might an example might be passing input along i just gave an example that a player might on their local machine do their customizations as and when they've kind of locked those customizations in that that might then be a server call to kind of communicate that information to the server to say hey server i've updated all my customizations and now let the other clients know that my hat should look different or something like that then we have client functions this is functions called on the from the server to individual clients again this is through a player controller so this is about a particular owned connection and then we have multicast that we already talked about this is a kind of shotgun this is our function that is just called everywhere so this might be any data that is kind of like everyone i know for a fact that every connected client will need to know about this that might be a case for a multicast",
