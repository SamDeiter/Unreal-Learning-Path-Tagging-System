  "text": " Now that we've completed our zombie walk, let's take a look at the state machine animation blending with an Unreal, working with some logic. Let's go ahead and jump into our animation blueprint. And what we're gonna do is we are going to unplug the really cool animation blueprint that we created. Go ahead and take that alt click and drag the output pose into here. And make sure you hit compile and save. Take a look at that main state machine. Now the main state machine is comprised of multiple nodes, just like what we saw visually, that determines certain logic. So let's go ahead and take a look inside. So zooming in here so you can see it, you'll notice that you'll see a visual representation there, even when you mouse over. If you hit control alt, you'll see a basic description of what a state machine is. Go and double click in that. And as the Russian nesting doll, as you see, has multiple types of logic going on here. Right here, we have a fall loop, a jump, and a two falling logic. And if I were to double click into this main state, or these states, I will see a sequence or an animation sequence here of the mm fall loop. So what happens is, as each time one of these states or active states are triggered, a animation is then also triggered based off from that state. So for example, this little transition is what determines what to do. So is it falling? If not, then it's jumping. If in the middle of the jump, at the end of that, we're going to fall. And this is going to be a conditional logic that continually runs. Now something else that's really nice about this, so we can double click in here. We could build an animation blueprint just as we saw that we built earlier. So if you remember the animation graph, this stuff right here, these nodes, we could do the exact same thing within one of these logic loops and make it even more optimized. Over in this case, these were built very simple to just trigger based off from whatever's happening. So if it's jumping, then we trigger the animation jump. And then this logic of a transition that we know that once he's done jumping, he's going to fall, that we want to have control over that. So that's what we're seeing here. We double click on that, you'll see all this additional information. So we could even adjust the curve to change either from the Hermite cubic in and out to any one of these as well, all based on what you want. So you have complete control over all the curves. And this is a great example, if you're landing quickly and you want to have, let's say a shorter duration or getting into a quick jump to fall, it has a longer duration. So these are all adjustable. All these transitions are adjustable. You'll see there's time here, the duration. I click on this transition, you'll notice it's slightly different, 0.4 and 0.3. So these are also adjustable, right down to the very granular part of anything you wish to adjust for your animation. Now you could also set up a whole system in which you have a core base pose, a control rig that goes into that base, and then even have a live link node with an actor in a suit, and even apply a controller to control the lower option, let's say it for driving the animation. Now that we've completely looked at our main states of animation graph, we're going to hop into the physical animation and create some animations based off from physics within Unreal Engine.",
