00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So thank you for checking out today's course on the landscape painting and sculpting.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hopefully it gave you a good overview of some interesting tools you may not have used before,

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
whether that's to do with the landscape sculpting and painting tools, and also just the cool brush settings that we have available to us when editing these landscapes.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We touched upon splines, which can be a really powerful tool to get a lot of mileage out of your landscapes,

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
whether it be roads or with barriers or whatever it is you want to be adding to your landscapes.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then the landmass tool, which is a cool new feature on Unreal Engine to really get some quite unique and interesting results from the landscape.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So hope you got a good use of some tools that you may not have used before, and we'll see you in the next course. Thanks.
