00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
Looking at landscape splines next.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.800
You can see that in this image here,

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.840
you can see the splines being used to map out a road

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.800
and some barriers here.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.480
And so landscape splines can do a number

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.960
of really interesting things in your landscape.

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.600
We can place splines down by holding down the Control key

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
and clicking on the landscape,

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.080
and then we can move and rotate and modify

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.600
the tangent handles of the landscape splines.

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.040
In a similar way, you might have used the spline tool

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.720
in a number of other ways inside of Unreal.

13
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.560
It's the same controls there to move the tangent handles.

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.960
And we can just click the landscape spline icon,

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.400
which you can see here in the viewport

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.360
to allow you to do this.

17
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
So you can deform the landscape using splines as a guide,

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920
and it's great for making paths or roads.

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.440
And to do that, you just go to the tool settings,

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.800
click on the deform landscape to splines option,

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.120
and then we can do this through the all splines

22
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.760
or just the current one selected.

23
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760
So you can see an example here of using the spline

24
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.040
in the details panel under landscape spline.

25
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.960
You wanna press the segments buttons

26
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.080
to select all the landscape splines.

27
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.640
And if done correctly, you should now see the option

28
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.560
in the details panel called the landscape spline mesh.

29
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.320
So if you select the landscape spline mesh

30
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.160
and press the plus icon to add a new static mesh

31
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.600
to the array, we can add a road for example,

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640
like in this image.

33
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.640
So for the mesh, we can import the SM underscore street

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.160
static mesh, which I'll do here in a second in the editor

35
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
to show you exactly what's going on.

36
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.080
And then we just want to uncheck center horizontally

37
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.600
and change the forward axis to Y

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.520
because of the orientation of the road mesh.

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.920
Just make sure you uncheck cash shadow

40
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.800
on your road setting mesh.

41
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.200
More for an aesthetic reason,

42
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.560
doesn't necessarily need to be done,

43
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.720
but it just looks a little bit cleaner

44
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.440
when we add that road spline.

45
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.480
So let's jump into the editor here and do that.

46
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.840
So when we're back in our editor here,

47
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.120
we can go to the manage tool at the top,

48
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.680
select splines, we're still in our landscape mode as well.

49
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.760
And then as mentioned, you hold down control and left click.

50
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.240
And so that will add a key onto the landscape.

51
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240
So you can see that we've got landscape spline selected

52
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.000
and you can just hold down alt and drag

53
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.700
to create a second spline path here.

54
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.040
So I'm just going to grab my road mesh.

55
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.480
I'm just going to right click on my content,

56
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.520
create a folder called meshes.

57
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.640
And from the other screen, I'm just going to drag in my FBX,

58
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.640
which is the SM street FBX that we were talking about before.

59
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.480
So we've got the street and let's just save all there

60
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.880
and just make sure everything's saved correctly.

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.320
So now in the detail setting of the landscape,

62
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.520
we then want to find this details panel

63
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.400
and we want to go to the segments section of the landscape.

64
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.280
So we can select the segments

65
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
and then we want to go to the landscape spline mesh.

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.760
And press the plus icon.

67
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.520
And then you'll see this index here

68
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.160
and it's looking for a mesh.

69
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160
So we just want SM street mesh found here.

70
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.560
And then we want to uncheck center horizontally.

71
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
As you can see, it's come in on the different axis.

72
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.320
So let's just uncheck center horizontally

73
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.640
and change the forward axis to Y.

74
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.800
There we go.

75
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.680
And so we can untick our shadow again for aesthetic reasons,

76
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.280
completely optional and up to you.

77
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.680
But you can start to see how we might be able

78
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.680
to edit this landscape based on the different settings

79
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.200
that we have available to us using the spline tools.

80
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.520
So if I just hit space bar,

81
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.080
you'll see I've got my gizmo here.

82
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.760
And essentially again,

83
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.080
as beautiful as we made this landscape look,

84
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.760
you can make your roads look beautiful.

85
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.560
You can hold down alt to add a new point.

86
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.320
Again, like we said, we have the same widgets

87
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.640
and gizmos available to us when making landscapes.

88
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.560
So we can move these around.

89
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
Again, you can like lift these up, et cetera, et cetera.

90
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.160
You can kind of get the idea,

91
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.360
but hopefully that gives you a good starting point

92
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.440
for using splines on your landscape.

93
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.000
Again, some of the settings that you'll need

94
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.400
are to do with the segments of the mesh that you're using.

95
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.520
If you're importing a mesh that doesn't look quite correct,

96
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.240
just check whether the center horizontally needs

97
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.200
and check in and also which the forward axis is.

98
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.520
So if Y is the forward axis for your mesh,

99
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.840
just make sure you set that.

100
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.040
And then we untick shadow in this instance

101
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.000
just to make it look a little bit more visually pleasing.
