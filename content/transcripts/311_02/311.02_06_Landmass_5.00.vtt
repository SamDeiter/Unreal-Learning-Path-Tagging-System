00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Next up, and lastly, we've got the landmass tool.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.340
So we can enable landmass from the plugin.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.160
So if you unsure where your plugins window is, you just go to edit at the top of your

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.860
browser, go down to plugins, you can either just type landmass in the search bar, or you

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.800
can find it in the other tab.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
When you enable that, your editor will likely want to restart.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.360
So just go ahead and restart your editor, and then we can move on to the next step.

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.040
So we can still create a new landscape using landmass.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.040
So we want to open up landscape tool, make a new landscape, any size again, however you

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.540
would like to make that look, and just make sure that enable edit layers is enabled.

11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.660
The landmass tools require that setting as we used last time, in order for these to work.

12
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.080
And then we have a few different options available to us.

13
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.360
So we want to make sure we're in landscape sculpt mode, which is the setting that we

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.160
used previously.

15
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.100
And then from the quick add in the project menu, we want to look for the custom brush

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.420
landmass.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.900
So with this little icon, you can just type in landmass.

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.860
And this act will allow you to control the location that landscape will be affected by

19
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.860
the brush.

20
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.980
So we can add more points from this brush when we've dragged it in.

21
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.680
You can add more points by selecting one and pressing alt whilst dragging exactly how we

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.220
did with the spline tool in the landscape.

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.760
So we can just make these different shapes using this custom brush landmass, which then

24
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.500
you can edit over the top of.

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.780
So you can see that we can start getting some really cool results here.

26
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.160
We can also use the material to offset the landscape.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.840
So if we wanted to add a change any settings here, here are some example brush settings,

28
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.640
which is a simple brush where you can see that that just adds a lot of interest to the

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640
environment.

30
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.560
So you can do that by first setting the brush type to material only.

31
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.820
So you can see brush type is material only.

32
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.500
And then to adjust the look, you just offset what you need to do in the brush material.

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
So when you can see that we've masked out some information here in our sample simple

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.160
brush and you can see that landscape then gets edited based on this material information,

35
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220
which is pretty cool.

36
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.580
And then we can also do some more custom things here.

37
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.060
So we can use a material to offset the landscape.

38
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.340
So again, material only, but we want to, so we want to set the material to material only.

39
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.920
And then to adjust the look of the offset, we just need to, again, just use this custom

40
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.760
override material where you can see that there's now the Unreal Engine logo, which is you just

41
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.320
tick the override material.

42
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.280
So even though we had a simple brush material to begin with, you have an override material

43
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.960
as well.

44
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.840
So here's an example of the material.

45
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.540
So to make the material work with this, the material needs to be unlit.

46
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.140
So make sure your material setup is unlit and use two material functions.

47
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.060
So we want to unpack RGB height here.

48
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.100
And this is for unpacking brush data into a format that can be worked into the editor.

49
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.840
And then we also want to pack the RGB height.

50
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.740
And this is repackaging the brush into something that will work with landmass.

51
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.480
So these two functions that highlighted, that's what you'll need to make your material work.

52
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.480
And then the material was converted into a material instance to make it easier to work

53
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.300
with the landmass system.

54
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.120
So once you've created this, you can change that texture sample into a parameter if you

55
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
want.

56
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.680
Just turn it into a material instance because then that makes the editing easier.

57
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.400
For a more in-depth example, check out the default landmass brush.
