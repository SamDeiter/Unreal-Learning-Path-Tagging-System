Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on advanced landscape sculpting and painting.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So today we're going to be covering the sculpting and painting tools and how you modify the settings to get the desired results you're looking for.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll also talk about how to refine some of these brush settings and we'll talk about the landscape spline tool,

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is kind of useful for creating roads and barriers and things like this over your landscape.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then we'll discuss the landmass tool at the end of the course, so let's get jumped in.
