00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
Moving on to our landscape painting tools that we have available, you can see that in

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.600
a similar editor window that we had before, you can see that we have the paint, the smooth,

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.880
the flatten and the noise. And what's interesting here is we have these layers, which you see

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.840
a grass layer, a dirt layer and a rock layer, which has been created through a material

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.700
that we have applied to the landscape. So the material creation here is such that we

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.620
use a layer blend node. So you can see the layer blend is just this option here. And then what

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.580
we'll do is we'll add three expressions here. So you can just hold down three on your keyboard

8
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.540
and left click, and that will bring up this coloured parameter here. Well, it's not a parameter by

9
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.980
default, you can actually right click and make it a parameter if you'd like. So you can call this

10
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.140
grass, you can call this rock, you could call this dirt if you wanted. But the main, the main thing

11
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.940
we want to look at here is this layer blend node, where if we select it, we can actually add elements

12
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.660
to the array by just clicking plus plus plus, that'll be on your bottom left hand of the screen here.

13
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.820
And if you make sure weight blend is assigned here, it should be set to that as default. But for each

14
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.380
index, we then want to give it a layer name, we want to give it grass, maybe dirt, and then rock.

15
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.740
And you can see that this will just go into the base colour of your landscape material. So it

16
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.740
enables you to modify the appearance of part of our landscape by painting textures onto the

17
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.780
landscape to help define some materials. So the tool settings here will work just as they do for

18
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.180
the sculpting mode. And once the key difference is that you need to select the layer you wish to

19
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.500
paint with when you're in landscape mode. So to show you what this looks like, if we've selected

20
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.140
the layer on our landscape mode, you can show that we can either do a weight blended layer,

21
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.900
which is a normal one, or we can do the non weight blended layer, depending on what this

22
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.220
layer is trying to do. So to show you exactly what this looks like, you can see that the weight

23
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.260
blended layer normal is this is the material and you would start painting in the grass.

24
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.660
Whereas if it's non weight blended layer, everything is applied based on on the height of

25
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.620
what your material is on the landscape. So you'll see I've created this super quick material in my

26
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.100
editor here. I'm just going to make sure I go in and apply this material to the landscape,

27
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.860
which you can just use by going back into selection mode, selecting the landscape,

28
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.460
and then the landscape material just needs to be the landscape material there. So we'll just type

29
00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:05.220
in landscape. Try and find it. If I just say m underscore landscape, there we go. And then we'll

30
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.580
apply that landscape material like this. And then if we go back into our landscape tool here,

31
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.660
you can see that we've got our paint tab at the top here. And we essentially just want to be

32
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.820
painting in the layers based on this layer information. So then we just want to press

33
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.660
this little plus icon. And we want to select the weight weighted blend layer in brackets normal.

34
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.660
So just as a reminder, the weight weight blend layers allows you to paint on top of layers,

35
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.940
so the layers can then blend. So we want to use this when we want to blend say rock into

36
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.260
an into dirt, sorry. And if you don't want the the weight, so non weight blended layers,

37
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.900
it allows you to replace layers as you paint over them. So we want to use that when we have

38
00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.900
snow covering rocks or dirt, for example. So we can just press this plus button. We want the

39
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.060
normal mode here. It'll suggest some kind of name for you. So you can just click save there.

40
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.420
And then we'll just press plus and then click save. And then we'll just repeat this for the

41
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.260
last time. And then layer normal, save. And then you can save everything here. So save all.

42
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.980
And then when everything's saved, it's just a case of painting in the information that you want. So

43
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.180
if you want the rock, and I'll just make my brush a bit smaller here. But if we wanted the rock,

44
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.620
we're just literally painting in the rock, as you see here. And again, we're changing the settings

45
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.180
such as the fall off, the strength. You know, if you just want the solid rock there, you can do.

46
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.180
Of course, this this won't look as beautiful as it possibly could do if you were actually trying

47
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.580
to do it for for real. But you can imagine we have a dirt layer down here. I'll change the fall off

48
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.780
a bit and maybe we just paint a bit of dirt down there, which is really strong. And then, you know,

49
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.740
we change the tool strength, you kind of get the idea of how you may want the layers to blend.

50
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.660
Your shader will keep rebuilding. You can imagine doing this on a larger scale. But here's a super,

51
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.860
super basic material. Three const variables, vector const variables that we can change the color of.

52
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.500
And you can see that we have the grass, the rock and the dirt. And it means we can paint

53
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.140
that into the landscape and create some beautiful results like you can see here.
