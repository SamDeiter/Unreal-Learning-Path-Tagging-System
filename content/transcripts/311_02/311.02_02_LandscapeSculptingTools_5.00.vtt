00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's start off by looking at some of the landscape sculpting tools.

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
So I'll just open my editor and jump in there now.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.160
And with my editor open, I'm just in a default blank map here.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.720
And I'm going to go to the selection mode and go to my landscape.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.160
And you can change this to whatever size and scale you'd like.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.320
I just want to work with something a little bit smaller here today just to give you an

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.160
idea of what's going on.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.920
I'll leave my components the same there and I'll just hit create.

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.000
And then when we create, we also want to enable edit layers at the top left here.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.520
And we'll show you what they do in a second as this gets loaded.

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.760
And now with the landscape loaded, you can see that we've got this landscape here that

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.280
we're preparing the shaders for as well.

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.720
But at least we can start editing the shaders.

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400
So the landscape, sorry.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.080
So you'll see by default, I have this sculpt tool here.

16
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.840
And what I can do is I can change the size of this by pressing the square bracket keys

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.120
next to my key enter key on the keyboard.

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.600
So by doing open bracket, it goes smaller.

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
Close bracket, it goes larger.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.640
And you can see this brush size is being changed here.

21
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.320
So we can kind of just left click around to edit that.

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.680
And so you can kind of see that we have all these different tools here.

23
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.760
And if we go to flatten, we can kind of flatten out the landscape as well.

24
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.720
But lots of different tools and you can change the strength of the tool depending on the

25
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.720
result.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.240
So brush size, brush fall off and the tool strength are going to be your friends here.

27
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.440
And you can play around with some of these settings, especially on this top row here,

28
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.640
just to kind of get the results that you're looking for on your landscape.

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.040
You can also see that when we enabled edit layers, we have a few functionality available

30
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.480
to us on our landscape.

31
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.680
So once the edit layers has been added, we can then rename them to something more useful

32
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.760
like a base mountains, roads, for example.

33
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.600
And then to use the edit layers, we first need to select a layer by clicking on it.

34
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.280
And then we just edit the landscape as we usually would.

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.440
So when we're done with that, we can just adjust the effect of the edit layer by adjusting

36
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.560
the alpha input.

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.800
So let's jump into the editor here and show you what's going on there.

38
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.400
So you can see as we previously had, we had our landscape here.

39
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.440
And you'll see that we have edit layers here.

40
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.960
So we can right click on this edit layers, we can rename this to say, base, for example.

41
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.400
And then we've, you know, edited this layer as we've been using that tool.

42
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.920
And then we can create a new one.

43
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.720
And let's say we just scope some more on top of this layer.

44
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.280
And you can see that then we can change the alpha of this layer to say how much of this

45
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.680
layer we actually want to add on top of that, which it can be really useful for kind of

46
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.960
painting in as we used in the previous example, the base and then the mountains and then the

47
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960
roads.

48
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.120
So, you know, if I wanted to rename this mountain, for example, and just we can kind of make

49
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.360
it so that it's preserving the information from the base and layering up our information.

50
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.320
So edit layers might be useful for you, especially if you're doing a lot of detailed landscape

51
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320
work.

52
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.120
And again, you can add as many layers as it takes to kind of get the results that you

53
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.920
want while preserving the data from the layer below.
