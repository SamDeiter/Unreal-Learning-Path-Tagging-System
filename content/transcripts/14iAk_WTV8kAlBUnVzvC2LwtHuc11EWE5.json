  "text": " Okay, welcome to this video. This is a second video on examples. In this case, we are going to be querying layer data within a landscape. Just a quick example of how you can use that to generate your PCG. So here we are and we are on slide two, example two, painting PCGs. So in this, we're going to see a very simple, straightforward square of a landscape. And what's interesting about this landscape is it's creating the grass, but it's only creating the grass where we are using the landscape layer graphs. So to demonstrate this, if I was to come into the selection mode for landscape. And let's expand this out a little bit. Now, you'll see that I'm on the paint tab here across the top and I've already loaded in my landscape material and it has two layers in it, grass and mud. And at the moment it is all set to grass. What I'm going to do is I'm going to change over to the mud layer. I'm just going to paint on some mud. And you'll see the PCG is now populating some stones based on that layer. So it's reading it into the landscape material. And I can sort of design my landscape and my PCG just by painting it into the world. OK, so that's how we do it. Let's see how this was put together. So the first thing is we need a landscape material, which is set to this. And here we have in our landscape material, the important part is our landscape layer blend, going into our material outlet, material attributes. And we have two, we have a grass layer and we have a mud layer. So this is going to dictate what material is on the land. Now, if we look into our PCG graph, we have a very simple, straightforward PCG graph. We are getting the landscape data as before. We're coming in and transforming the points. But what is quite interesting, I see if I can get it up here as a depot object. So if I was to... As I look, you can see that at the end here, we have an extra attribute, which is automatically getting added to our points attributes. And that is the grass and the mud layer. And what these are is they give us a variable of how much that layer is painted. So you can see at some points, it's halfway between the two, most is over one or zero. And that is what I am filtering on here. So if I look at this filter attribute element, I'm looking at the attribute grass. That's going to be this grass attribute here saying, is it more than... And I'm doing a constant threshold of zero. So those are the elements that you need to change. I'm doing exactly the same here for the mud. I'm just changing the mud over and I've changed over what meshes we are smolding. But that has... It's just an example of how you can... A lot of different stuff gets placed into attributes. And as soon as there is an attribute, you can sit there and you can sit there and use them and filter by them. OK, so that's all you need to do. Obviously, it can get vastly more complicated. But it just demonstrates quickly how you can get more data into your PCG to change the way it works.",
