  "text": " With extending the light switch now completed, that is going to go ahead and wrap up this video tutorial series. Now we first started this video tutorial series talking about object oriented concepts. Remember this deals with the parent-child relationship where parents establish default functionality that's then passed down to the children and the children can override or extend that default functionality that they receive from the parents. We then took a look at the difference between the controller and pawn classes and why we want to have one single controller control multiple pawns. We then moved on to working with blueprint interfaces and why these are important not only for optimization but also makes it very easy to have blueprints interact with one another. We then took all of this information that we discussed and put it to use by creating a light switch that when activated can turn off a specific light and we followed that up with extending that light switch to allow us to select multiple lights so the same light switch would turn multiple lights off instead of just a single one. I hope you enjoyed this video tutorial series. My name is Sam Deiter with Epic Games and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",
