  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video where we will be jumping into the engine and starting off some of our exercises. Before we start there is a project file which comes with this course. I highly recommend that you download it. This course is designed to be a follow along and this really helps to make sure that you know how to set everything up and have some hands on experience working with it. Now there are a few plugins that you might want to have turned on or actually require some of them if you want to use smart objects. In the project that we're downloading these plugins should already be turned on so you don't need to worry about setting them up and restarting them but I would like to go over them here. So to start off with we have the smart object plugin and this is what will allow us to set up and use the smart objects. The second one is the AI behaviour. Now the smart object system doesn't necessarily use the AI behaviour system but it is recommended and this is the system that we're going to be using in all of our examples. It is a modular way of creating behaviours that can be plugged into things like state trees. And in order to get these running in combination with each other there is another plugin that we'd like you to turn on and that's the gameplay behaviour smart objects. Now in these two systems to talk to each other. Now we're going to use another plugin which again is not necessary but it does really help when you're trying to tie together animations with specific locations and measures. And that plugin is motion warping. What this is going to allow us to do is adjust animations dynamically so that we can have things like sitting, vaulting and interacting can line up correctly with the smart objects and the measures that are within the level. Now with that said let's jump into the project and we will start off by creating the classes that are going to be needed. Now when you've downloaded this project and opened it up you should hopefully get a screen that looks a little bit like this. Now we are using something that's called the training page and what this is going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to move between the different sections of the project as we're going through and it's going to highlight the assets that we're going to want to be using. So hopefully this fires up when you start off. If not under the links first kill this down under the link selection we have the training And that will bring this up. What I usually recommend is that you take it and you dock it in the top here and ideally place the outliner below it. And if you bring it down so you can just see the top you can check that you're on the same slide as me and we're in the correct place to teach the class. If you don't have it don't worry too much the level itself isn't too hard to navigate. I am going to jump to the first slide here the example chairs. Now one thing you can see is this is brought on my content browser. Now we're going to be doing a lot of work in the content browser so I'm going to hit the button dock in layout. Now you can see that we have it down here. We are at the exercise one and we can see that we have our first that we're going to be looking at. Now at the moment we have one NPC who is in the level. If you were to push play he would do nothing. Well this is because we have some problems in our state tree. And if we have a look at our state tree chair. As you can see we have a relatively simple state tree. And what it's going to do is we have a route and we see if we can find a smart object that is unclaimed and we use that smart object if we can find it. Now if we do not find the smart object we are going to come down to the part of combat here and wander about and go back to route. And after that we've gone after we come back to route we are going to check to see if we've got a smart object again. Okay so it's a straightforward we have two settings you're either wandering around or you're using a smart object. Now the reason why this isn't working is because if we really jump into the tasks you'd see that we are lacking a load of code. And that is because we are going to add in this code as part of the exercise so that we can see how it's work. But before we do that we are going to need to create a few different classes. So the first class that I would like you to make is gameplay behave. So this is what we're going to run when we actually go in and use the object. So I'm going to come up in here I'm going to search for blueprint class and I'm going to search for gameplay behaviour. And you can see that we have gameplay behaviour here and I will select that and I'm going to name this GP for gameplay behaviour and sitting down. So we're going to be doing a lot of sitting down. Okay so that is my first class. Now the next class that I want is going to be the gameplay behaviour config. So if you right hand click again come up to the blueprint class and search for gameplay behaviour. So we have that here and we will open that up. So again the gameplay behaviour is the actual thing that we're going to do. The config is the configuration where we can change some of the settings in the gameplay behaviour. Now the next thing we're going to do is create a smart object definition. Now this is slightly different to how we've created the other ones because what we're actually going to do is right hand click and we're going to be looking into the miscellaneous side and from this we're going to be selecting a data asset because this is what the definition can be part of. So if I search for smart you can see that we have an option for a smart object definition. I'm going to select that and I'm going to call this smart object definition so sod and this is going to be for a chair. Just going to call that sod chair. Now we have all the files we need in the next video we can start setting them up so they work in conjunction with each other.",
