  "text": " So, the first modeling tool I thought might be useful to touch upon is the relocate pivot points. This will be a really powerful tool if you want to make these minor changes to content that's inside your editor. It's a really quick and easy way rather than loading your external package. So, you can relocate the pivot point manually or we can use presets to snap it to the most common places. And then once we've applied the changes, it will save in your static mesh editor, which means any instance you drag out will have the new pivot point selected. So, to jump in the editor and to show you what we mean here, we have this forklift and the pivot is in the correct place and it's quite easy to move around with the pivot being in the place it is. If we had imported our pivot from our DCC package, you know, maybe the forklift was off world zero when we exported it and we hadn't really set the pivot point correctly, you can see that although the pivot point is able to be moved here, especially when we're like close up to the content, it makes it very hard to navigate, especially when you rotate something, it just goes way off the pivot here. So, how do we get the pivot point to match something closer to this forklift? So the first thing you want to do is select your modeling mode here from the drop down. So the top left hand of your screen here, with three different options, you just want to select modeling, which there is a shift shortcut key for as well. For those of you that are toggling through these settings quite a lot, it might be useful to remember some of these hotkeys. So you want to make sure the modeling tab is selected. You'll see two dialog boxes open. You'll see a modeling tab at the top here and you'll also see a mode toolbar here. So you may see some of these options highlighted. If you don't, it means that you've not got your actor selected. So these are all grayed out right now. If I select my actor, you'll see they all become visible. So at the top of the list, you'll see shapes and then we'll scroll down to transform and on the transform, you'll see the pivot option here. So again, if this is grayed out, just make sure you have your actor selected. I'll select pivot and we can do a few things here. We can move the pivot around if we wanted to set it manually and it'll snap to different vertices. We can, again, like I mentioned before, have a few presets. So you can say center pivot, you can say bottom pivot, you could say top pivot. Wherever you decide to store that pivot, I'll leave it at the top for now just so you can see the different options. But once we've edited the pivot to where we want it to be, we just want to accept the edit pivot box. So once we accept it, it will save the content. So if we go to our content browser now and this is the bad pivot that I just saved, so I'll just right click and save it. And then when I drag it out, you'll see that the pivot point is on the top here. Now for this specific example, I'd probably want this pivot on the bottom like it is here, but I just want to show you that that used to have the bad pivot. Now that we've saved it, our content browser is updated with the correct pivot. So really powerful tool if you want to edit something directly in real time. As you can see, it's just a few button clicks rather than jumping back into your DCC app. So that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. If you did, please like, share, and subscribe. Thank you for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Bye.",
