  "text": " Now that we have our Niagara effect created and the proper template set, let's go ahead and set it up. Now the first thing we're going to do is we are going to change the material. So we're going to do this by clicking on the icon of the material inside the effect and then going under our sprite renderer material and changing the material option to that M Smoke sub UV that comes with the starter content. So let's pop over to the editor now, open up our effect, and right here if we just click on this little icon of our material, you'll see we get the default sprite material. So what we're going to do now is we're going to come over to our starter content, go down to our particle materials, and then I'm going to look for our M Smoke sub UV. So selected that. Then with that selected, I'm going to come over to our sprite rendering material and input. And that is going to give us our sub UV. Now if I pause this and look at it, it's going to look a little weird. And the reason it looks a little weird is because in order for this sub UV to play, we need to tell the particles how big each cell is. Now you determine how big each cell is by basically the size of the texture. In our particular texture, we have eight individual cells going across and then eight going down. So our sub image size is going to be eight by eight. So let's go ahead and set that up now. So inside of our editor, we're going to come over to our details panel, sub UV, and then just set this to eight by eight. And when we do that, there's automatically going to turn into little bits of smoke for us.",
