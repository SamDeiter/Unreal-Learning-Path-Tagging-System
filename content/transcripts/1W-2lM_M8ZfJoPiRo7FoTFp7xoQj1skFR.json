  "text": " Besides your viewport, there is also a Construct from Script tab. Inside of this tab, you can put down logic via nodes that are going to fire off before this blueprint has actually existed in the level. So, anything you need to happen before the level loads, or just before the object is spawned in the level, this is going to be where you'll place it. If you want to set any information, such as a character's clothing or maybe the colour of a vehicle, and you want it set up before the act that actually enters the world, then you're probably going to do that here. To add anything, just go down to this node Construct from Script. This is the only thing that's actually going to be available at first. Now, if you look a little closer at this, you can see it's just one big node object, and it has one output pin. What is connected to this execution pin is going to be what is fired off first, and then it will continue in order from left to right. So, simply left-click on the pin and drag it out from there. When you let go, you'll get prompted to add in a new function. Now, in this search tab, you can search for any available function. In this case, let's use a branch, which is a common function type. So, select Branch, hit Enter, and you'll see that a new node appears. The white wire will let you know that these two nodes are connected. It will fire off from left to right, so we can easily tell the order that these different nodes are going to be actioned in. So, after the construction node, the branch node would be found. And then based on how we connect this up, it would make a logical choice and go on to fire other nodes. And that's how blueprints work at their core. Thanks for watching!",
