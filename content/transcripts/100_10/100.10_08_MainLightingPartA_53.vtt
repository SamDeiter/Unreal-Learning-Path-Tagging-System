00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For this next section, we are going to be primarily focusing on lighting our scene as if we were on an actual stage.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Indoors, no exterior lights, very controlled lighting.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now there are a couple things as we go about lighting this scene that I want you to keep in mind.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Some of these core principles.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The first one that I want to address is this idea of trying to add too much light or trying to add too many lights at once.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And balancing them all at the same time.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One of the approaches that I recommend the most when it comes to lighting is using more of an isolated approach.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the idea basically behind this is add a light, adjust the values to where it looks fairly balanced.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Again, coupled with the fact that we've disabled auto exposure and we have essentially controlled the environment in which we're building our lights.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can add those lights, adjust as needed, and then disable them temporarily.

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Continue to add lights as necessary.

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then in the end, come back and balance all of those lights together.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Ideally, this is going to avoid us adding so many lights that things get either too bright or too dark.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then we're essentially running circles around adjusting light values, coloration, et cetera, over and over and over again.

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So for this particular section, we're going to disable all of our lighting except the skylight.

16
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We are going to create our light stage.

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Again, I've got some things within the collections parameter that you can use to make this process easier.

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And again, using that isolation approach, we're going to add our lights, adjust values, disable those lights and then move on to the next light.

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And then finally, and turn all of them on and then balance them just with their intensities as needed.

20
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now, one of the recommendations that I do have when it comes to building your lighting is, again,

21
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
because we're trying to adhere to more realistic values, is using something that does have a real world counterpart, such as candelas or lumens.

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll show you how to do that.

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then finally, the last thing, because we are using Unreal Engine 5, we're going to be using fully dynamic lighting, meaning we don't have to bake our lighting.

24
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So we want to make sure that any light that we add to our scene is set to movable.

25
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So to start, we want to open up our zero one neutral level, which is going to be in our content classrooms walkthrough.

26
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And within this particular map, we've added some different callouts just to show you the things that we have changed or how we've gotten to this point.

27
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now, again, all of these bridge off of what we had just talked about.

28
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, for example, if I select our PPV neutral, which is our post processing volume, neutralize the light and then we can add some more light.

29
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So we're going to go ahead and select our post processing volume neutralizer.

30
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You'll see here we have our bloom disabled, our exposure compensation set, Minimax CV.

31
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now, one thing to note is as you're working with this, you can.

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, for example, this one is calibrated.

33
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The exposure compensation, if you adjust this up or down to make it brighter, that's not necessarily bad.

34
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But again, we use our tools to make sure we stay within value.

35
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So you can see that even though it looked brighter, if I adjust this, you'll see that I've clearly blown out the upper range of my values.

36
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So, again, I'll set this back to negative five point five and we're looking pretty good.

37
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So with our directional light, you can see here that we have some values here.

38
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
For example, our sunrise, typical overcast day, bright sunlight, brightest sunlight.

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You can see where we have that correlation with our lux.

40
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So, again, I could also check we don't have the lights in here.

41
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So we can change this value again from using unit lists, deluxe or candelas.

42
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We'll change that in a little bit.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And the same thing here, we have some correlations to again, some real world counterparts.

44
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, for example, a hundred watt bulb incandescent bulb is going to be roughly around sixteen hundred lumens.

45
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
All right. So to get started, I'm going to select my directional light.

46
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm going to go ahead and just turn off the effects world.

47
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So this should be disabled.

48
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm going to use my skylight to make sure that this is still enabled.

49
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We're unmovable. This should still be the same.

50
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Our cube map and our source type. You see this is fairly good.

51
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Again, with intensity scale, if I were to bump this up to say something like three hundred.

52
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Again, just be very careful with this because this is the only light in our scene.

53
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We don't necessarily want to adjust this too much right now.
