WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Next, we'll wanna drop in our overhead diffuser,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.800
which will kind of act as our global stage light.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.880
So this is gonna be our Chimera 10 by 30 foot

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.600
light white diffuser.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.520
And this is gonna be within our collections

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.600
underneath the light stage.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.800
So we'll jump back over to our scene.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.800
And I'll go ahead and clear up my place actors,

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.120
go down to my collections,

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.760
and we're gonna look for our light stage.

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.640
And here is that Chimera 10 by 30 foot white light.

12
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.760
So I'll go ahead and drag this into our scene.

13
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.600
I'm actually gonna go up to the light stage,

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.400
I'm actually gonna go up into unlit mode real fast,

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.160
just so I can see placement.

16
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
We're gonna move this up,

17
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400
kind of move this around, rotate it,

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.600
and move it into place.

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.160
I'm gonna press G to go into game mode.

20
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.520
And I'm gonna go to lit mode.

21
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.880
And now you can see we're actually starting

22
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.040
to get some effects.

23
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.460
Now it's important to note real fast here,

24
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.660
a couple of things that are occurring.

25
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.200
Because we are using Unreal Engine 5,

26
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.720
we have Lumen enabled.

27
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.520
So this light panel,

28
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.360
which actually doesn't have a light in it of itself,

29
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.680
but rather is using the material emissive properties

30
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.640
to cast light into our scene.

31
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
And then secondly,

32
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.560
because we are using DirectX 12

33
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.180
and we have those higher quality reflections,

34
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.520
you'll see that we start to see them

35
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.960
within the actual reflections of the vehicle.

36
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.600
And of course, any object that has anything

37
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
that's not rough, we start to see those reflections.

38
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.040
So again, no lights per se within our scene right now,

39
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.600
outside of just our skylight,

40
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.120
but rather just the emissive material

41
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.520
from this particular panel.

42
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.600
So with that being said,

43
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.360
we actually want to add a light into our scene.

44
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.320
And in particular, we're gonna be using

45
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.260
what is called a rec light or a rectangle light.

46
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.160
Now it's important to note that rectangle lights

47
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.880
are probably the most expensive type of light

48
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.000
that you can use in our scenes,

49
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.100
just because of the nature of how they're built.

50
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.360
And that is totally fine for what we're doing.

51
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.840
For real time applications,

52
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.640
I would say just be mindful

53
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.640
that if you're adding a ton of rectangle lights

54
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760
into your scene,

55
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.240
that's where you may notice a dip in performance.

56
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.080
But again, for this scene,

57
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.600
we should be totally fine to add several rec lights

58
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.300
and still run fairly well.

59
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.380
So if I jump back to our scene,

60
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.820
I'm gonna go to our place actors.

61
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.560
I'm just gonna type in rect,

62
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.000
which will give me my rec light.

63
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.920
If you're curious too,

64
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.880
you can actually just click the little lighting

65
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.980
light button here.

66
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.540
And we can see here as a rec light,

67
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.460
get us to the same spot.

68
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.360
So I'm gonna drag one of these rec lights into our scene.

69
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.800
I'm gonna press G to go back into game mode.

70
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.720
And essentially what I wanna do

71
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.600
is just rotate this into place

72
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.600
where it's fairly aligned with our light panel.

73
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.080
So I'm just kind of setting this up a little bit.

74
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.860
And there are a few settings that I wanna change.

75
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.020
The first thing is we are setting candelas.

76
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.560
Here you can see that we can change exposure value,

77
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.040
lumen or unit list.

78
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.220
For this case, I will just continue to use it.

79
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.620
Actually, let's go and change it to lumens.

80
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.880
And then I wanna go ahead and set my intensity here

81
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.560
to 12,000 lumens, which should be fairly bright.

82
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.440
In fact, we can see that exemplified on the ground.

83
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.500
So we'll turn this off and on.

84
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.320
You will notice we have this preview shadows indicator

85
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.540
and that's because we are in stationary mode.

86
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.100
So again, all of our lights are gonna be fully dynamic.

87
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.080
So we'll switch it to movable.

88
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.200
All right, so I'll come back down here a little bit

89
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.720
so we can see what's happening.

90
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.640
So the next thing that I wanna do is adjust a few properties.

91
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.400
So the first is attenuation radius.

92
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.720
So if I drag this all the way down,

93
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.680
I can take a look here,

94
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.360
you'll see that this is effectively

95
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.080
the influence of that light.

96
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.280
So within this outer sphere,

97
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.560
this is the full extent or how far the light

98
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.400
can affect something.

99
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.240
So in this case,

100
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.160
because this is a very large primary source,

101
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.760
I'm gonna change our attenuation radius

102
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.400
to something like 2,500.

103
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.120
And you can see this encapsulates our entire scene,

104
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.680
which is exactly what we want.

105
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.420
All right, the next thing that I wanna do

106
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.780
is actually adjust the width and the height.

107
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.380
So the way that erect light works

108
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.780
is we essentially have these barn doors.

109
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.340
So if I kind of take this down, you'll see,

110
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.660
kind of like they're flaps,

111
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.700
they're doors on the side of the light.

112
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.680
But in particular, this main center square

113
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.520
that we have here,

114
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.980
this is essentially where the light is being projected from.

115
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.280
So we want to match that inner square

116
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.500
to essentially the projection zone

117
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.200
or where our light panel is.

118
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.880
So to do that, I'm actually gonna change

119
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.040
our source width to 850,

120
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.240
our source height to 240.

121
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.800
And you can see that I've actually got this rotated

122
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.680
90 degrees.

123
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Let's go ahead and rotate this back.

124
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.000
And then again, I could go into here real fast

125
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.580
and just essentially try to get this aligned

126
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.080
to our panel as much as possible.

127
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.600
And that should be good enough.

128
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.420
There we go.

129
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.700
So this better, more closely matches

130
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.480
our actual Chimera panel that we have here.

131
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.280
And finally, the last thing is we could take

132
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.320
our barn door angle down just a little bit.

133
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.900
So we can set it to something like, for example, 55.

134
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.360
And we could, if we wanted to adjust our barn door lengths,

135
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.060
although in this scene, we won't particularly notice it,

136
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.340
but I'll go ahead and just set that to 40.

137
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.180
All right, cool.

138
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.500
So that should get us all set up on our light panel.

139
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.320
And then lastly, if we wanted to,

140
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.060
we could essentially just duplicate this light panel

141
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.900
to give us just a little bit more effect.

142
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.980
So I'm gonna take both of these.

143
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.220
So just hold down Shift and Select.

144
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.420
I'll move these up.

145
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.200
And you can see with our real world lighting values,

146
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.380
again, because we're using energy conservation

147
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.720
the way light works, is if I push this closer

148
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.620
to the surface, you'll see we get much brighter,

149
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.020
much brighter highlights of the light.

150
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.780
So I'll kind of move this up a little bit,

151
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.220
move this off to the side.

152
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.980
And then again, you could do Ctrl C, Ctrl V.

153
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.960
But in this case, with both my light and my panel selected,

154
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.380
I'm just gonna hold down Alt and drag off and duplicate.

155
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.440
So there you go.

156
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.080
Now we have some lighting that's occurring in our scene

157
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.740
that looks more natural.

158
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.200
I'm always gonna go back to my calibration tools

159
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.440
and find out, hey, this may be too bright.

160
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.640
I'm gonna go ahead and just select both of my rec lights.

161
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.880
And maybe what I do is,

162
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.500
I'm gonna go ahead and just deselect.

163
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.460
There we go, our rec lights.

164
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.780
And maybe instead of 12,000 lumens,

165
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.940
I drop these down to 8,000.

166
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.460
Compare against my calibration tools.

167
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.800
And you can see that, okay, we are sitting much nicer

168
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.620
and our results are actually speaking for themselves,

169
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.060
looking very good, very realistic.
