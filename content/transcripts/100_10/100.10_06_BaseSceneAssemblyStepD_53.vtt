00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now the next part of this process that we're going to be building out is by adding our skylight.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now the skylight, you can think about this as kind of the the general ambient light that would be reflected off of the sky itself.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So if you think about the earth, naturally we have an atmosphere which does reflect light back.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But of course, it's a massive, massive dome.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's essentially what we're recreating here with our skylight.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now the difference is we are going to be specifying our lighting again with this whole idea that we are wanting to control our lighting and the effects 100%.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're going to do that through using a very specific cube map.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now in this section here, there's something that's not quite accurate to what I said before, but that is an intentional thing here that we're actually going to talk about.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So we're going to go ahead and set up these settings in our project.

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So if I jump back to our scene now, in this case, I can go to lit mode because we're actually going to start adding this light so we can see what's happening.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm going to go up to my place actors, clear my search, and I'm going to look for sky.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What I'm looking for is the skylight component.

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So if we drag this into our scene, we won't really see a whole lot happening right now.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And that's totally fine.

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
All right. So the settings that we want to change, the first thing is we want to switch the mobility of our skylight to movable.

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, in this case, the position of my skylight doesn't matter.

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's fine. We could reset it if we want to maybe pull it up above the vehicle so we can see it.

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I'm going to change my mobility to movable.

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then the next thing that I want to do is change my source type.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Instead of SLS captured scene, I want to change this to SLS specified cube map.

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, from this cube map, we could select our drop down and see all the various ones that are available.

22
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The one that we are looking for is this small hanger, 01, 4K.

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So if we add this to our scene, now I'm going to go ahead and bump up our intensity to that 30 so we can start seeing some effects.

24
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I may take it up to 120 just so we can see what's happening.

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In fact, let's go ahead and bump this up to 600.

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And you can see now we're getting that ambient light reflected in our scene.

27
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now, just to cover a brief point that I mentioned before about this, not necessarily being the accurate way that you want to do this,

28
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but for the purposes of this class, this is important.

29
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So if you remember that what we're building towards is a neutralized scene, a neutralized baseline.

30
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And one of the sins, if you will, that I've done with using this particular cube map is you'll notice when I open up the cube map and look at the actual texture itself,

31
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
it has a lot of more or less like creamy kind of skin tones within it.

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is ideally not what we want to use, right?

33
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We would want to use an HDRI that is for lack of better terms as desaturated as possible.

34
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So I could use this HDRI, maybe go desaturated, do some post settings inside of the engine.

35
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In fact, I will move this off screen real quick and just show you if I go down to saturation and change this to zero.

36
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And I click save.

37
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We should get an update.

38
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We'll go ahead and actually just disable this, re-enable it.

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And you'll see how quickly our scene changes.

40
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So again, this is an important note to keep in mind that if you're going to be using an HDRI,

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
try to use the most desaturated as possible for your scene to, again, to keep that neutralized baseline.

42
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So I'll go ahead and keep this as is and we'll close it and we'll continue to use this skylight.

43
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
All right.

44
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The next thing that we're actually going to change here is our cube map resolution.

45
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And obviously we've adjusted the intensity scale.

46
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So what we're going to do is with the cube map resolution, this is going to be visible.

47
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In fact, let's go up to the vehicle here.

48
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Some kind of move up a little bit and we can see within the reflections here, the the sky map itself.

49
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So the actual cube map being reflected off of this.

50
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So right now, the default resolution is 128.

51
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But if I change this to something like, say, for example, 512, you'll see we start to get a lot crisper reflections in here.

52
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In fact, you could bump this up to 1024, although at this point we're kind of introducing more of a placebo effect.

53
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
512 is fine.

54
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You'll see some other things that are happening.

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But be careful with this.

56
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You don't want to adjust this too high.

57
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So above 8K or 16K, that gets very expensive and might cause some instability.

58
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So with your cube map resolution, we just want to bump that up to get a higher value.

59
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And then finally, you saw that we have our intensity scale.

60
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I have it set at 600 right now, but we will adjust this down as we start having more lights into our scene and we start to see the effects of those lights.

61
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But again, keep in mind that this is just our general ambient light within our scene.

62
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So keep this as is now and adjust this a little bit later.

63
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And finally, one of the other settings that I want to change is this lower hemisphere is solid color.

64
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So by default, in fact, if we expand out our advanced underneath our light, you'll see that we have this lower hemisphere color and lower hemisphere is a solid color.

65
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is the default behavior.

66
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But because we're using this cube map.

67
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So if we imagine just a invisible line that goes halfway through the engine by default is going to basically discard the information that is the lower half of this HDRI.

68
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And we can re enable that by simply just unchecking lowest hemisphere is solid color and that will get the additional information from our cube map to project basically into our world.

69
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So we'll go ahead and uncheck that lower hemisphere is solid color.
