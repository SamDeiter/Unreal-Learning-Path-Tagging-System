00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we have our project set up, it's time to start creating our neutral baseline.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, to cover kind of the principles of what a neutral baseline is, it's very simply put that we are trying to remove any and all artistic effects in our scene and work from a calibrated baseline.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is very important because without a calibrated baseline, we may be chasing our tail artistically.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're trying to over adjust or under adjust lightings. So having that calibrated baseline is very critical.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, some of the things that we're going to do in this scene is disable our auto exposure.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We can do that either on the project settings or in our post processing volume.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now we'll opt to use the post processing volume as I find that that's much more flexible than setting it just project wide.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're going to also disable all of our artistic effects, again, also through our post processing volume.

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're going to use some various calibration tools, some that ship with the engine and a few that actually come with our automotive materials pack.

10
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And then the important things that we want to adhere to is avoid colorizing our lighting or adding any really crazy effects in our post processing.

11
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Again, we will do this later in later stages of this class.

12
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We'll actually go back in and add some of those artistic effects.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this entire process is completely non destructive.

14
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And then finally, a another important principle about having a very good neutral baseline is making sure that the materials pack is completely non destructive.

15
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And making sure that the materials that you use to check your scene, to check your lighting are as high quality as possible.

16
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And same thing with your models.

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So to start, we're actually going to open up our zero zero start map, which is in our content classrooms and walkthrough.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, if you open up this file and it looks blank, don't worry.

19
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
In fact, we go up to lit, unlit mode, and you'll see that, in fact, the car is there.

20
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So everything is fine.

21
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Included with the project is a series of collections.

22
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now, collections are just a handy way of organizing content in your project.

23
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They don't necessarily move any of your content.

24
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
They simply just help you to store these content based on various different things.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, if you don't see the content now, as of five dot three, I believe this is default.

26
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It should be docked in the lower left here under collections.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And if you just expand it out, you should see the collections that we've included.

28
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, with this, I'm just going to select the calibration and you can see that we have some assets in here.

29
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, an important thing to distinguish here is that these assets haven't been moved to the separate folder.

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In fact, some of these exist in the project.

31
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Some of these exist in the actual engine itself.

32
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But a collection is just a handy way of earmarking or bookmarking this content for ease of dropping it in your scene or using it.

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So again, if you don't see collections, it should be rolled up in the lower left here.

34
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Just expand it out and you see all the content that we're going to be working with.

35
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And then finally, the other thing to keep in mind is that we're going to be using some engine content such as our skylight,

36
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
direction light and post processing volume.

37
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And all of those can be found from the place actors panel.

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So if I go back to the engine and you don't have this place actors panel, in fact, if it's closed, we're going to go up to window place actors.

39
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And it should dock in the left.

40
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
As a point note, too, you can absolutely drag any of these windows off and dock it wherever you see fit.

41
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So we're going to be using this along with some of our collections to pre populate or populate our scene with what we're trying to build.

42
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So the first thing that we want to do is remove all of these artistic effects.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We also want to clamp our exposure compensation.

44
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So to do that, we're going to do that through a post processing volume.

45
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I'll jump back over to the engine real fast.

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And again, I'll go to unlit mode so we can see what we're working with here.

47
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Go to your place actors.

48
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Easiest way is just to start typing in post and we'll grab this post processing volume.

49
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So we'll drag this into our scene.

50
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm going to go down to my transformations and just click the little loop back arrow here to reset our settings.

51
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So if I jump back, you can follow along in these slides for the different settings that we're going to use.

52
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But essentially we are going to recreate what we see here inside of our scene.

53
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
All right.

54
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now, because we don't have any lights, it's going to be rather difficult to kind of see what's happening.

55
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But essentially, our post processing is going to control a host of different artistic or visual effects into our scene.

56
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And we will see that later exemplified when we actually have some of our lighting.

57
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But for now, we can just follow along with this.

58
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So the first thing that I want to do is with my post processing volume selected,

59
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
go over into my details panel.

60
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm going to scroll all the way down until I see the post processing volume settings.

61
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the first thing that I want to do is check the infinite extent unbound.

62
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now, there are situations where you may want to localize or control your post processing effects within just that volume or that shape.

63
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And that is the default nature and behavior of our post processing volumes.

64
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
However, for this, we don't want it to we don't want those effects to be contained just to the post processing volume shape.

65
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We want them to continue to propagate no matter where the camera is positioned.

66
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And that's what infinite extent unbound is going to do.

67
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
All right. So with that checked and we have enabled, we're going to scroll back up.

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And the first thing I'm going to look for is my exposure tab.

69
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So if I expand this out, anytime that we have a setting and we check the box,

70
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we are now overriding whatever the default behavior or the current setting is based off a priority,

71
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which in this case, as we only have one post processing volume, we are simply just going to change this setting.

72
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So on our exposure compensation, I'm going to change this to negative five point five.

73
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
What does that number come from?

74
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Simply just because of the light values that we're using, the fact that we're trying to adhere to more realistic values.

75
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We'll find this later with our directional light.

76
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
A value of negative five point five is going to give us correct or at least visually correct exposure in our scene.

77
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
However, note that this particular parameter you can adjust up or down if your scene is too bright or too dark.

78
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
That's not the most critical component.

79
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The next component that we actually want to change is our min and max.

80
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In fact, this is going to be directly correlated with our exposure compensation.

81
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So if we clamp these both at one and one or zero and zero or whatever the same value is, this essentially fix the auto exposure.

82
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So now the engine won't try to adjust the exposure of our in-game camera or how we're viewing based off of these numbers.

83
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So those few settings right there should be all that we need to disable our auto exposure and allow the post processing volume take effect across the whole scene.

84
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Now, we could go in as well, as you had heard me mention, too, about adjusting some of our artistic effects.

85
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
For example, I could take chromatic aberration, check the intensity to make sure it does, in fact, overwrite at zero.

86
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We could change our bloom intensity to zero as well.

87
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So again, anything artistic related, disabling it.

88
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Of course, we can always re-enable these later through a secondary post processing volume,

89
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but simply just check the parameter itself and go ahead and set the value to zero.
