1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Now that we have our overhead lighting established, we want to start going in and adding various

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.540
different accent lightings to this vehicle.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.460
Now if you've ever seen an actual photo shoot of a vehicle on a stage like this, you'll

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.600
know that there's various different lights that are placed throughout the different scenes.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.680
We'll have various bounce light.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.180
With all of the beautiful curvature of the automotive surface, we want to call out particular

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.020
highlights to various different things, whether it's new product shots, etc.

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.780
So to do that, we're going to use various different techniques of adding accent lighting

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.220
to our scene.

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.460
Now again, going back to some of these principles we've already been talking about, really this

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.240
is where the approach of isolating our lighting, testing it, disabling it temporarily to continue,

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.460
this is where it's very important.

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.420
We're going to be adding various different lights throughout our scene, and if our eye

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.260
is competing against lights that are turned on versus the specific light that we're looking

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.660
at, it's going to be very difficult to get that controlled look that we want.

16
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.380
So again, with this isolation method, we're going to disable our overhead lighting and

17
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.780
our skylight, and we're going to create our lights one by one.

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.900
Now if we do find that we put a lot of time and effort into creating a very beautiful

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.820
looking light, it's absolutely fine to go ahead and duplicate that and move it around.

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.060
Absolutely fine.

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.520
Once we're finished though, we want to make sure that we disable that light or those series

22
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.420
of lights that are closely related, and then continue to build onto our next.

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.620
Finally at the end of it, we're going to re-enable all of our lights and then balance our intensities

24
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.780
to bring them within tolerance.

25
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
Now again, we're going to use those calibration tools to make sure we're not overexposed or

26
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.900
underexposed with our lighting intensity.

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.300
And then lastly, we're going to use some various different fills and what we call kickers,

28
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.580
or just little lights to help bring attention.

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.060
There's a couple of little techniques I'm going to show you to be able to do that where

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.420
we don't inject too much specularity.

31
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.660
Yes, it is breaking some rules of science in convention, but that's absolutely fine

32
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.020
because we're working in digital medium, which means we can break the rules and it's absolutely

33
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.740
fine.

34
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.660
So for our scene, this is essentially what we want to build.

35
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.060
So you can see that we've we still have our overhead lights up above and we have various

36
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.780
different rec lights all around to kind of give these really nice, interesting highlights

37
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.020
and also driving various different intensities in our scene to accent our vehicle in the

38
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.020
middle.

39
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.020
So we'll go ahead and jump over and start building that now.

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.620
All right, so jump back over to our scene now to just help better visualize what we're

41
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
doing.

42
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.580
I'm going to go up to our outliner and I'm actually going to hide our calibration as

43
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.600
well as our notes folder.

44
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.440
And that should give us a fairly clean scene that we have here.

45
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.880
All right, so for this one, I'm essentially going to position my camera, you know, somewhere

46
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.400
relative to where I think maybe the final shot will be.

47
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.180
So we'll kind of use this, you know, semi low shot that we have as this.

48
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.360
So now what I want to do is go ahead and add some rec lights to our scene.

49
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.320
Now I'm not going to cover too many basic principles about lighting, whether or not

50
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.920
you use like three point lighting, Rembrandt lighting, all various different things.

51
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.920
It's really whatever medium or whatever your intended vision is.

52
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.460
But essentially, I'm going to reference a few key things here.

53
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.520
In particular, I want to make sure that I don't have super dark shadows.

54
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.240
And I also want to make sure I don't have too many lights.

55
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.380
So I'm going to do essentially what is a three point lighting setup.

56
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.640
So a light, our main light that kind of gets cast from our camera, maybe a side light from

57
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.040
our left and then a rim light on the back just to help separate the subject, which in

58
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.240
this case is our vehicle from the background.

59
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.920
All right, so I've dragged my rec light into the scene.

60
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.600
I'm going to press G to go into game mode.

61
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.160
I'll kind of move this rec light into place, kind of fly around here.

62
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.640
It's going to rotate and I'm going to go ahead and set it to movable just like we need to.

63
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.960
And I'm going to go ahead and adjust the width and maybe the height just a little bit.

64
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960
Check where we're sitting.

65
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960
All right.

66
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.360
And then maybe my barn door angle a little bit so we can see that in fact I'm rotated

67
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360
180.

68
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
So we'll get this turned around.

69
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.160
And of course, this is very, very, very weak right now on our intensity.

70
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.760
So if I turn this off and on, you see we don't really notice much of anything.

71
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.680
All right, so I'll go and change this back to lumens and let's go ahead and change this

72
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.360
to something like let's just say a hundred thousand as our starting point.

73
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
Okay.

74
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.880
Clearly too bright so we can drag this up or down.

75
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.800
Maybe we'll do something like let's go like six thousand lumens.

76
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.360
Okay, that's still probably a little bright, but let's go ahead and get the light set up

77
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.160
and then we'll do a little bit of the balancing in a minute.

78
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.360
All right.

79
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.160
So if you recall with our principles of lighting, right now I'm trying to light the front of

80
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.040
this vehicle while I still have my overhead lights on.

81
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.800
So I'm going to select my two rec lights and then just disable them with the effects world

82
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.000
or I can simply hide them and see now all I have is this one.

83
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.840
Now we also have our panels illuminating so I can also hide these and now you can see

84
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.140
the actual light itself.

85
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.480
So with our overhead lighting on, you can see that it was quite deceptive in that the

86
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.500
light so this light that we're adjusting right now looked way brighter than it actually was.

87
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.600
So again, this is why we want to use that isolation approach.

88
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.200
All right, so I'll just go in here and just kind of adjust this light.

89
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.840
Now at this juncture, I could go in and I could add some color.

90
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.120
So if I select the color picker wheel, you see I can do this.

91
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.060
If you do decide to use colors, my best recommendation is avoid overly saturated colors because that's

92
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.560
really not natural.

93
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.640
But again, we're working a digital medium so if you want to, absolutely fine, break

94
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.840
the rules.

95
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.720
That's absolutely fine.

96
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.800
But for this one, I'm actually going to use the use temperature and you'll see here that

97
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.240
I can maybe warm it up.

98
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.400
This uses our Kelvin scale or cool it down.

99
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.760
I'm going to go something with let's say like 6000 Kelvin should be fine.

100
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.080
All right, so if you recall in our setup, so this is going to be like our main key light.

101
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.040
I could go in here, hold down alt and just drag this way.

102
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.320
Going to rotate this on the front of the vehicle and maybe I want to move this up.

103
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.280
Maybe I want to adjust this panel just a little bit more to give myself some height.

104
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.120
Again, the key is I'm looking for my reflections and the actual light intensity in the world.

105
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.920
And how I want to use that.

106
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.400
I will say that the energy fall off does look a little weak so I'm actually going to select

107
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.640
both of my rec lights and I'm going to go to my attenuation radius.

108
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.040
Let's go ahead and bump this up to 2500 and see starts to fill the scene a little bit

109
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040
more.

110
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.440
All right, and then lastly, I'm going to go ahead and take this same light, duplicate

111
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.440
this, put it behind our subject and you can see we get that really sharp highlight.

112
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.280
Maybe I want to take this up a little bit and rotate it.

113
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.560
Now I'm going to switch from world units to local space.

114
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.640
I'm going to take this down, tilt it a little bit and maybe I want to move this up a little

115
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.040
bit more and maybe bump up our intensity to say something like 8000.

116
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.160
There we go.

117
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.920
So now we're starting to get some separation on the vehicle.

118
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.840
At this juncture, it's simply just a matter of balancing so I could go into here and maybe

119
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.240
move this light a little bit closer, something like this.

120
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.960
And now I'm starting to accent the vehicle a little bit more.

121
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.440
I can go back in, turn on my overhead rec lights and maybe my chimera panels and you'll

122
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.280
see now things are starting to really shape up in terms of accenting this vehicle.

123
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.840
Now just to show real quick, so I'm going to select the three lights that we just placed

124
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.040
and pressing G to go into game mode.

125
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.080
And if I hide these, you see this is what we started with and then this is with those

126
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.800
lights added.

127
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.600
So again, I could go back in here with my calibration tools, just double check that

128
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.600
you know, I'm within tolerances, I'm within the ranges that I need to and then make any

129
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.360
adjustments as necessary.

130
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.200
Now as a key learning point, if you did find that your scene was overexposed and what I

131
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.480
mean by that is with the lights being overexposed, it's just simply a matter of going in and

132
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.680
adjusting their intensity, right?

133
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.320
So each one is about 6,000 and our back one is at 8,000.

134
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.080
We could just lower those and then same thing with our overhead panels, adjusting those

135
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080
as necessary.
