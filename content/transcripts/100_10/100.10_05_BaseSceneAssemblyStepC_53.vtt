00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this next step, we're going to be adding a shader preview ball, the SM shader sphere,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.920
to our scene and apply various materials to the scene.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.720
Now, an important thing to note here is that we are using materials from the automotive

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.600
collection which have been fully calibrated against their real world counterparts.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.160
Loosely translated, these are very high quality materials that we can compare our lighting

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.680
against to make sure that we're staying as physically accurate as possible with our scene.

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.880
So to do this, I'm going to jump back to our project.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.560
Now inside of our collections, we have calibration.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
You see we have the SM shader ball.

10
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.600
Now I'm going to move around my scene real quick, still saying in unlit mode, and I'll

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.340
just drag the shader ball into our scene.

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.560
And then I can duplicate it a host of ways, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, right click, duplicate, or

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640
I can just hold down the Alt key and drag to whatever direction that I want to and just

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.160
get myself a few variations of this shader ball.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.680
Now this shader ball does exist inside of the engine.

16
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.400
In fact, it's shipped with the engine for quite a while.

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.960
You can highlight over it and you can see where it's located.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.600
But in this case, again, if we use our collections, it's just handy and preset there.

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.560
The other thing that I can do is I can actually go down to various materials.

20
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.800
So inside of our classroom, I've got things like car paint and then a couple of ways that

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.920
we can add this simply drag and drop it onto the shader preview ball.

22
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.120
Or if we reset that, we can actually just select our material, drag and drop into our

23
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.080
element zero or with a selected hit our little arrow.

24
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.940
Either way, very quick way to do this.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.320
Now for the purposes of our class, I'm just going to add a few materials that I do want

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
to compare against.

27
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.760
Ideally, giving myself a broad range of things to compare against.

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.600
So for example, I may take our glass or add this on there.

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.600
I may go down into some various metals like chrome or our iron.

30
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.440
Now if you do want to pursue other materials that are in here, we've got the automotive

31
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.800
materials folder and inside of this, you'll see that we have various different materials

32
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.240
based off of interior and exterior to compare against.

33
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.400
The point here is that we really just want to have a good range of different materials

34
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.000
to compare our lighting against.

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.040
So I may go in and add, actually you know what, let's look for some leather.

36
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.040
So in here and maybe I'll just find something like this orange, drag this on there as well.

37
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.760
And then again, just make sure that you have at least a good, we'll use this floor mats

38
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160
as well, why not?

39
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.760
We'll have a good variation of materials that we can compare against.

40
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.000
Now if I do go to lit mode, you'll see again, we don't have any lighting, so these will

41
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.360
continue to stay in the shadows for lack of better terms.
