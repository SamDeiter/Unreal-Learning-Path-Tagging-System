00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So the first thing that we want to do is remove all of these artistic effects.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We also want to clamp our exposure compensation.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So to do that, we're going to do that through a post-processing volume.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'll jump back over to the engine real fast.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And again, I'll go to unlit mode so we can see what we're working with here.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Go over to your place actors.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The easiest way is just to start typing in post, and we'll grab this post-processing volume.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we'll drag this into our scene.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to go down to my transformations and just click the little loop back arrow here to reset our settings.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So if I jump back, you can follow along in these slides for the different settings that we're going to use.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But essentially, we are going to recreate what we see here inside of our scene.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
All right. Now, because we don't have any lights, it's going to be rather difficult to kind of see what's happening.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But essentially, our post-processing is going to control a host of different artistic or visual effects into our scene.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And we will see that later exemplified when we actually have some of our lighting.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But for now, we can just follow along with this.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So the first thing that I want to do is with my post-processing volume selected, go over into my details panel.

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to scroll all the way down until I see the post-processing volume settings.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And the first thing that I want to do is check the infinite extent unbound.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, there are situations where you may want to localize or control your post-processing effects within just that volume or that shape.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And that is the default nature and behavior of our post-processing volumes.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
However, for this, we don't want it to we don't want those effects to be contained just to the post-processing volume shape.

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We want them to continue to propagate no matter where the camera is positioned.

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And that's what infinite extent unbound is going to do.

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
All right. So with that checked and we have enabled, we're going to scroll back up.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And the first thing I'm going to look for is my exposure tab.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So if I expand this out, any time that we have a setting and we check the box,

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we are now overriding whatever the default behavior or the current setting is based off of priority,

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which in this case, as we only have one post-processing volume, we are simply just going to change this setting.

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So on our exposure compensation, I'm going to change this to negative five point five.

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What does that number come from?

31
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Simply just because of the light values that we're using, the fact that we're trying to adhere to more realistic values.

32
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We'll find this later with our directional light.

33
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
A value of negative five point five is going to give us correct or at least visually correct exposure in our scene.

34
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
However, note that this particular parameter you can adjust up or down if your scene is too bright or too dark.

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That's not the most critical component.

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The next component that we actually want to change is our min and max EV.

37
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In fact, this is going to be directly correlated with our exposure compensation.

38
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So if we clamp these both at one and one or zero and zero or whatever the same value is,

39
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
this essentially fix the auto exposure.

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So now the engine won't try to adjust the exposure of our in-game camera or how we're viewing based off of these numbers.

41
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So those few settings right there should be all that we need to disable our auto exposure

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and allow the post processing volume to take effect across the whole scene.

43
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, we could go in as well, as you had heard me mention, too, about adjusting some of our artistic effects.

44
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
For example, I could take chromatic aberration, check the intensity to make sure it does, in fact, overwrite at zero.

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We could change our bloom intensity to zero as well.

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Again, anything artistic related, disabling it.

47
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Of course, we can always re-enable these later through a secondary post processing volume,

48
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but simply just check the parameter itself and go ahead and set the value to zero.
