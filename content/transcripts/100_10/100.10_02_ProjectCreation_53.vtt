00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
So let's dive in and create our new project.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.760
Now to do this, we're going to be using our Epic launcher.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.600
We need to make sure that we have our engine version installed, which in this case we're

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.260
going to be installing 5.3.

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.600
From there, you will have a launch button.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
This will launch a separate window.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.700
And inside of this window, we can open up recent projects or create projects based off

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.240
of various templates.

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.520
Now for our project, we're going to be using the automotive product design and manufacturing

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.240
templates and we're going to use the blank to start with.

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.300
We'll cover here in just a little bit about what these templates do, but just know that

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.160
this is going to serve as our starting point.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.040
Next we'll want to set our project location.

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.720
So this is where your project files will be stored.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.600
And then we'll also give our project a name.

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
Now it's important on both of these, both on your project location and your project

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.880
name that you keep those file paths short.

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.680
Ideally, you should keep these well with under 20 characters.

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
The shorter the better.

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.000
To explain in a short, very quick, concise summary, the engine, in particular when working

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.680
with operating systems like Windows, there is a character limit of 255 characters, which

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.640
can quickly be overtaken with several different files that ship with the engine.

23
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240
So in short, just keep your file path short.

24
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.480
Keep your project name as short as possible and then click create.

25
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.880
So let's go ahead and just step through that process real fast.

26
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.080
So here I have our launcher and you can see that I have 5.3.2 installed.

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.800
I'll click launch.

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.640
And we'll give it a second to pop open the window.

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.040
All right.

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.880
So after about 30 seconds of the engine installing everything that it needed to, you can see

31
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.080
that we now have our Unreal projects browser window.

32
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.560
So I'm going to select the automotive product design and manufacturing section.

33
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.320
And you can see here we have that blank project.

34
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.840
So all I need to do is go ahead and put in my project location and give my project a

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600
name and then hit create.

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.120
That will go ahead and create our project.

37
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.600
To better understand what templates are, it's important to understand that templates aren't

38
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.160
actually using a special version of the engine or opening special things that you don't otherwise

39
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.600
have with the engine.

40
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.040
In fact, every template that ships with the engine utilizes the exact same underlying

41
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.240
core engine.

42
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.540
The difference is when we use any of these automotive templates, they will often preset

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.220
certain values or enable certain plugins that that project or that template was designed

44
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.220
to use.

45
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.280
So in the case of our automotive project, there are a few things that turn on, for example,

46
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.040
such as our sudden position calculator plugin, the data Smith importer we even have.

47
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.000
And you can see here's a couple of settings in the project.

48
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.360
Our reflection capture resolution has been bumped up to 2048 and our default RHI has

49
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.480
been changed to DirectX 12.

50
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.900
Every single one of these settings, every single one of the plugins that is utilized

51
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.280
by those templates, you absolutely can go in, enable yourself, change those settings

52
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.080
beforehand, change them after.

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.980
Again, it's important to understand that the template is just pre-setting these things

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.880
for you so you have a good starting point, but you absolutely can modify them.

55
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880
And that's the lead point thereafter.
