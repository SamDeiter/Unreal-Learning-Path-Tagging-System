00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
And finally, moving on to the last point that I talked about was this idea of kicker lights.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.600
So it's important to make note here that there's a couple different techniques that we can

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.840
use for our kicker lights, or essentially just to draw some accent to our scene or our

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.360
subject.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.320
But in particular, we're still going to adhere to the same principles.

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.800
We want to make sure that we don't have too many lights or too many high intensity lights

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.280
within our scene.

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.520
We also want to take full advantage of our attenuation radius.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.040
In particular, as you'll notice in the screenshot on the right, how we have various different

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.120
point lights within the vehicle.

11
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.120
These point lights are really just designed to accent various features of the vehicle,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.120
right?

13
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.480
If we're selling this vehicle, we want it to look good, we want to draw the eye in.

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.440
So by setting our attenuation radius low, that light will only affect a very small part

15
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.020
of our scene.

16
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.740
So jumping back into our scene, I'm actually going to move our camera towards the interior

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.380
of the vehicle.

18
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.280
So with our current lighting setup, it really doesn't look bad at all, but it also doesn't

19
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.340
really draw my eye or my attention to various features of the vehicle.

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.100
So let's take a look actually in this lower section here by the floorboards, which is

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.460
actually pretty dark.

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.240
So I'm going to use this principle of adding various different kicker lights to basically

23
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.740
highlight that section.

24
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.380
So I'm going to go ahead and just kind of zoom down into here in the passenger side.

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.180
And let's go ahead and drag in a point light from our scene.

26
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.180
And you can see that it's actually snapping above.

27
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.620
So I'll press G to go into game mode.

28
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.180
Now at this point, if you have snapping turned on, this may actually be a little detrimental

29
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.600
trying to get this thing in the exact position.

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.500
So I'll go ahead and turn off my grid snapping here for my translation.

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.800
Now you can see that I can move these things into place.

32
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.880
And again, I'll get this light relatively within the location of where I want it.

33
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.160
OK, so we'll do the same thing.

34
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.080
So I'll go ahead and switch it to movable.

35
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.180
And you'll see my intensity right now is at eight in candelas.

36
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.080
If we want to stay consistent, let's go and switch it to lumen.

37
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.080
And I'll set this to something like, I would say like, let's go like 50.

38
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.840
In particular, I'm looking on the dashboard here where you can see, I can see the light

39
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840
a little bit.

40
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.800
Because again, all I want to do is just essentially draw some attention to our scene.

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
All right, so I'll go ahead and set my attenuation radius fairly low.

42
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040
So I'll go something like, let's say like 60.

43
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.120
You see now we're starting to affect just that area and kind of move this around.

44
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.040
Maybe I'll adjust this down to 50.

45
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.820
All right, so I'm going to go back to G, go into game mode, and I'll kind of zoom back

46
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.120
to our perspective that we looked at before.

47
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.320
And I'll go ahead and turn this off and turn it on.

48
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.720
Off and on.

49
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.480
So you see here with that kicker light, I'm actually drawing some attention to maybe the

50
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.480
speakers.

51
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.760
Maybe this is, you know, an amazing stereo system and we want everybody to notice it.

52
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760
Right?

53
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.120
So this is a perfect place for those kicker lights.

54
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.520
So I'll go ahead and go back into game mode.

55
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.120
And essentially this junk track could go in and I could duplicate this light.

56
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.480
I could move this around here.

57
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.320
I could, let's say that we want to add another light up here by the steering wheel or, you

58
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.000
know, maybe bring some attention to the dashboard like this.

59
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.920
I'll move this other one down here, maybe to the console.

60
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Right?

61
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.440
And then maybe we'll do a couple in the rear as well.

62
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.960
And maybe I'll set their attenuation radius up to something higher, maybe like 120.

63
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.200
Right.

64
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.640
And now I'm starting to get these accents.

65
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.880
So again, let's go back from our perspective.

66
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm going to select all of my point lights and just really quickly group them.

67
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.120
And we'll just call these kicker lights.

68
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.880
And then I'll turn these off and on.

69
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880
And it's very subtle.

70
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.140
You can kind of see what's happening.

71
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.680
But I'm going to go ahead and just go to these real quick.

72
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.360
And I'm going to adjust their intensity from 50 to 200 just so we can better see on the

73
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360
video what's happening here.

74
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.320
So again, off, on, off, and on.

75
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320
All right.

76
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320
So now we're starting to fill out light.

77
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.160
Now, one quick little trick that I do want to show here is if you notice that we've got

78
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.980
these specular highlights occurring wherever the lights are in kind of the tangent angle

79
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.160
of the camera to the light itself, and we can actually remove some of that effect by

80
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.340
if we scroll down.

81
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.320
So in the point lights themselves, so in this case, I have all of them selected.

82
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.880
We have this specular scale.

83
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.080
So I can take the specular scale of the light and let's say we drop it at something like

84
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.000
And you see now it basically starts to act like a diffuse light.

85
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.860
So we still have the same intensity, but you can see in the reflections, it's much smaller.

86
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.680
It's much more mitigated and really helps to not detract the eye, but rather just help

87
00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.560
to accent some of the various different things that we wanted to show in our in our scene.

88
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.580
So at this juncture, really, this now boils down to artistic interpretation or what you're

89
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.460
trying to create with your scene.

90
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.140
So by placing these lights, isolating them, creating our kicker lights and viewing from

91
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.860
our different angles, we can start to light our scene artistically to whatever vision

92
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.860
that we've set out.
