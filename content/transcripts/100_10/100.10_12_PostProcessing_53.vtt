00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
At this juncture, you should have had enough time to go in, add all of your various different

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.440
lights, add your kicker lights, change your colorations, right?

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.440
Essentially build out the scene that you want and you want to achieve.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.880
And now we're going to start getting into adding back in some of those artistic effects

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.920
that we removed with our neutralized scene.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.200
So if you recall, when we set up our scene, we created a neutral baseline, right?

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.640
We removed any of the post-processing effects, anything like bloom, et cetera.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.840
Well now we can go in and actually add these back into our scene.

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.520
And through that, we're actually going to use a process that I really like, which is

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760
just called layered post-processing.

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.840
So rather than go back into our post-processing volume that we first set up, we can keep it

12
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
there.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.440
In fact, we can just add a secondary post-processing volume and start overriding some of those

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.940
various different settings that we want to bring back.

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.320
Now the key here is our priority.

16
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.660
So if you recall, inside of our post-processing volume settings where we set the infinite

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.860
extent unbound or enabled or disabled, we can also give that post-processing volume

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860
a priority.

19
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.580
Now the higher the priority, right?

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.220
So one is higher than zero means that that post-processing volume, any setting that we

21
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.560
check will override whatever is below it.

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.020
So let's jump back into our scene real quick.

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.060
And if you want to start on this one, we can just go to content, classrooms, walkthrough,

24
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.940
and we'll start on the post-processing volume.

25
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.920
Now just a quick note, feel free to dissect this entire scene.

26
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.540
Now this is obviously outside of the time that we have for this particular training

27
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.160
module, these videos.

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.460
But in here you'll see that I've used all of the various different techniques that we've

29
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.460
covered in the previous videos.

30
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.120
So here are overhead lights.

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.980
Here you can see that three-point lighting we set up.

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.260
In fact, I added a fourth for kind of a nice little fill on the bumper.

33
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.820
And then we've also added our kicker lights on the inside here.

34
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.820
So again, feel free to select the lights and you can go through the various different settings

35
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.360
that I use to achieve this.

36
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.660
And then lastly, while we didn't cover how to use spotlights, essentially the principles

37
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660
are exact same.

38
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660
We can go to our place actors, drag in a spotlight.

39
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.880
In particular, the difference between a spotlight and say a rec light or a point light is we

40
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.960
actually have a cone.

41
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.120
So in this case, I've added two spotlights onto the logo because why would it be a car

42
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.000
commercial if we didn't have our logo?

43
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.720
So here you can see that I'm adding just a little splash of light to the logo.

44
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.240
So from whatever direction the vehicle is being viewed, very prominent here on the front.

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.560
So we turn it off, on, off on.

46
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.880
Same principle here as the kickers on the inside.

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.240
We're simply just adding some accent lighting to our scene.

48
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.600
All right.

49
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.560
So that should bring us to where we're at.

50
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
Okay.

51
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.320
So now what we want to do is go in and actually add some post-processing effects back to our

52
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
scene.

53
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.720
So then I'm going to go back to my place actors and just search for post-processing volume,

54
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.380
drag this into our scene.

55
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.000
And again, this doesn't necessarily matter where we place it.

56
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm going to go ahead and reset it to zero.

57
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.880
I'll select off of it, select it again so it should highlight within.

58
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.920
I'll go ahead and just roll up some of these things in our.

59
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.480
There we go.

60
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.860
So underneath environment, we have our PPV neutral and here is our new post-processing.

61
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.640
So I'm just going to rename this to PPV and then we can call this artistic.

62
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280
And again, this is just going to be all of our artistic settings that we want to override.

63
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.000
So I'll go ahead and drag this up to environment just to stay nice, neat and tidy.

64
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.080
So with my post-processing volume, the artistic one selected, I'm going to scroll down, do

65
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.360
our same thing, make sure infinite extent unbound is checked.

66
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.280
And then again, we just want to make sure that the priority is higher than whatever

67
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.240
our baseline is, which if we select the neutral, you'll see we set it.

68
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
We're set at zero.

69
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.040
So my artistic, I'm going to set at one.

70
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.440
And basically just to show the way this works is right now I have a bunch of various different

71
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.120
settings, but you'll notice that nothing really changed within our scene and nothing will

72
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.020
change until we actually go in and adjust one of those parameters.

73
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.140
So for just ease of viewing what's happening here, I'm going to check my exposure compensation.

74
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.360
And if you recall from our neutral, it's set to negative 5.5.

75
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.580
So as soon as I uncheck this, whatever is below it, so whatever the next presiding value

76
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.540
is, which in this case is 5.5 from a neutral, that's what will take effect.

77
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.320
But by checking it, now I have the ability to override that value.

78
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.060
So I'll go ahead and just reset it and uncheck it.

79
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.260
All right.

80
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.360
So now again, I'm going to press G just to go into game mode so you can see it's happening.

81
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.860
This is where we can go in and start adding our artistic effects back in.

82
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860
All right.

83
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.860
So I could turn on bloom again.

84
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.780
So we get that nice bloom.

85
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.220
We can adjust our threshold.

86
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.620
I could take my intensity.

87
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.620
Right.

88
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.280
We could do whatever it is that we wanted to.

89
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.620
We could also go into different lens flares.

90
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.380
We could change various different vignettes, do something like this.

91
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.300
We can even go as far as actually doing color grading within the editor itself.

92
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.860
So I could go something like my temperature, so I could tint it, maybe do something ultra

93
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.820
warm or maybe we drop it down.

94
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.500
I could tint the effect as well.

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.660
I can even go into my various different highlights and shadows.

96
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.260
So maybe on my shadows, I want to bump up the gain a little bit, or maybe I want to

97
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.740
make it really noir-esque.

98
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.300
Whatever you decide that you want to do.

99
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.580
At any point, I can just disable these and again, retain whatever is below it.

100
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
Okay.

101
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.580
All right.

102
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.460
So once you go through and you add all these different settings, again, the important part

103
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.060
to keep in mind here is we haven't lost our calibrated baseline effect.

104
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.820
All I have to do with my artistic is either hide it or I could simply just go down into

105
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.600
the post-processing volume settings and just disable it.

106
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.500
And now we're back to our neutralized baseline.

107
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.140
But of course, if I disable both, you'll see now this is just the engine doing its thing.

108
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.780
There's auto exposure in place.

109
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.300
So by having both of these on there, that allows us to achieve whatever artistic look

110
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.220
that we want to and still maintain that neutralized baseline.
