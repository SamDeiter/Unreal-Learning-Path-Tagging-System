00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And lastly, we want to add our directional light,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is going to be our main light in our scene.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, for this example, we can essentially view our directional light as,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
say, for example, the sun.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We will change this a little bit later as we start doing more artistic

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and very specific kind of staged lighting.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But in this case, we want to replicate the sun.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So to do that, we're going to use our directional light.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then we'll keep these settings in mind here

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that we're going to change.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's go ahead and jump back over to our project.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
All right, so from here, we're going to go to our Place Actors panel,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and I'm going to search for directional light.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We'll just drag this into our scene.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And we won't see much of an effect, and a big part of that is because

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
our post-processing volume is controlling that exposure.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So underneath our intensity, we're actually going to use

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a more realistic value of 300 lux.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And then we're also going to go down to our mobility settings

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and change this to movable, which will get rid of our big lighting area.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then you can see if I move this light around,

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you'll see we actually do have that directional light occurring.

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then there are a few other settings that have been noted here,

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in particular about disabling distance field shadows

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or unchecking atmospheric sunlight.

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
These are for more advanced topics, but in this situation,

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
again, if I'm actually trying to recreate the sun,

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I may want to put on like light shaft occlusion, light shaft bloom.

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There are other things as well that we can do within our shadows,

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
distance field shadows, turn those off and on.

31
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
For the purposes of this example, all we really need to be concerned about

32
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is changing our mobility to movable, the intensity set to 300 lux,

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and we should be good thereafter.

34
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So this should get all of our lighting set up, and you can see, in fact,

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we are now actually, you know, again, referencing and comparing

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
against our various different materials that we have in our scene.

37
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can see that we start to get a fairly good look at our scene,

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and things are actually shaping up really well.

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then lastly, one of the other things that I do want to mention here

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is you can see from this particular scene that we have set up,

41
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we have our preview spheres with various different materials.

42
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Of course, we have our vehicle in the middle.

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And there are a couple other tools that I want to make mention real quick

44
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
as you're building out this neutralized scene.

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So if I go back to our classroom underneath the calibration collection,

46
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
we have this BP calibration, which is included with the automotive materials,

47
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and this SM color calibrator, which is a part of the core engine content.

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So if I drag these into our scene, so I'll kind of move this up,

49
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then I'll drag this calibration into our scene,

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I'm going to go ahead and just scale this down,

51
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
just slightly lift it up and rotate it.

52
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So the important thing to note about both of these assets is

53
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
they include some very convenient and very standardized,

54
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
various different references for building out various different lights,

55
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
coloration, et cetera.

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So both of these include a Macbeth chart.

57
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So that's what this middle color swatch is,

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and these do correlate with a real world chart.

59
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So the Macbeth chart has very specific color values, hex values, luminous values, et cetera.

60
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So by dropping this into our scene, in particular if we look at our color gradation

61
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
or at least our luminous gradation here, we can quickly see that,

62
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
for example, in this lower right, the white cube and then the not as white cube beside it,

63
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we can still see it, meaning that our scene is not overexposed or underexposed.

64
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now to show a good example of where you would want to compare

65
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
your lighting against these particular tools,

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
if I select our directional light and change our intensity, let's say, to something like 150,

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
or let's even go down something like 50,

68
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
you can see things start to get a lot darker.

69
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And again, we can reference these specific color values to find out if we're within range or out.

70
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then conversely, if I change our intensity to say something like 1200,

71
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you see it start to blow out our upper end of our values, which is again not exactly what we want.

72
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I'll go ahead and change this back to 300 lux,

73
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and you see we fall well within the range that we were looking for.
