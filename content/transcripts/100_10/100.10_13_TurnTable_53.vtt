00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
As a final step to this class, we're going to go in and actually just add a small turntable

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.640
rotation to the vehicle just to give it a little bit of movement and see our lighting

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.200
in action as it kind of glances over all the various different surfaces.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.720
So if I jump back to our scene, so I'm going to open up this 06 final, which should have

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.680
everything involved.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.420
Now on the Audi A5, you may see a rotational component.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.300
So if we just select that vehicle and in the route here has like a rotation movement, go

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.400
ahead and select it, delete it, and we'll start from there.

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.980
So just to recap in our scene what we have happening, so we've got our neutralized baseline.

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.260
We've got our artistic effects added over the top.

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.620
Now if you want to see what's been modified, great and easy way to do this is select this

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620
little settings cog.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.860
I apologize, this is off screen, but there should be a show only modified properties

14
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.740
and this will show you everything that's been changed over the base.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.200
So you can see how we achieve this visual look by simply using this artistic effect.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.100
So again, if I turn it off, there's our neutral, turn it on, you see now we have these effects.

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.460
All right, so with the Audi A5 DS selected, I'm actually going to go to this component

18
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.660
here and what I'm going to do is click the little add button and I'm going to search

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.660
for rotation.

20
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.740
So I'm going to do add, add rotation movement, it's fine like that.

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.620
And I'm going to go ahead and turn off my show only modified properties and underneath

22
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.900
the rotation movement, simply put, all I got to do is go down to rotation movement and

23
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.780
instead of 180, which is going to be very fast, let's change this to something like

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.780
15.

25
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.980
All right, now what I can do is go up to my settings.

26
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.140
Now in this case, I'm going to use simulate.

27
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.980
You could use selected viewport, but I'm going to use simulate.

28
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.660
And as soon as we do that, you see our vehicle now starts to rotate.

29
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.100
And there we have it.

30
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.740
That's going to conclude what we've built in this introduction to automotive visualization.

31
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.540
With our lighting, again, just to recap real quick what we've covered.

32
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.100
We've established our scene, we've put in all of our different components, all of our

33
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.200
different calibration tools.

34
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.820
We've then gone in, we've used a isolation approach to our lighting to add our lights,

35
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.700
add our artistic effects or whatever we want to with those particular lights, hide them

36
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.940
at all in the rest, balance, and then finally go in and add a post-processing volume to

37
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.820
be able to add back some of those visual effects that we're looking for.

38
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.460
And then lastly, by simply just adding a little bit of raz and dazzle to this, by adding a

39
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.220
rotational movement to our actual Audi itself to be able to see the thing rotate in our

40
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220
scene.

41
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.260
And that will conclude this course.
