  "text": " Now that we have created our project and got the initial setup and imported our assets, we're going to transition into talking about the landscape material creation. Now before we get into this, each project's approach to creating a landscape is going to be different. You can use a different collection of methods all dependent on the workflows for your project. Now this particular example that we're going to be going over today is going to use this type of setup. We're going to have a procedural layout based on the slope of the landscape that will expose different materials, that will expose different textures in our material in order to highlight where different surfaces are. We're going to also have textures that are for close-up detail and textures that are for far away detail to help reduce tiling artifacts. We're also going to introduce hand painting, but we're going to do it so that we can actually remove the procedurally placed grass, so we have a little bit more control over where it is, but more importantly, where it is not. Finally, we're going to add displacement to all of this to really help our landscape's surface stand out with nanite and the new nanite tessellation options. Thank you.",
