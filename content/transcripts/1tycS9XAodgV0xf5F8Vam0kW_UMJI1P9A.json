  "text": " So now we've figured out a way on how to lock the door. Let's figure out a way to say, okay it's locked, yes. How do we now create it open at runtime so that not only by before we jump in the game deciding if they're locked, depending on a certain action, how can I then open a door? So I'm just going to delete the second door, I don't need that now and I'm going to create a button to press for the door that then says this is now unlocked. So we want to create a new blueprint for this so I'm going to open my quick draw, I'm going to hit control space bar, I'm going to right click, I'm going to create a blueprint class like we did before, I'm going to select actor like we did previously, I'm still going to call this BP underscore and I'm going to call this button. So BP underscore button, hit enter, I'm going to hit enter again and it's already at the top of my window here. Now I want to find a mesh for my button so I'm going to hit control and space bar, I'm going to scroll down to my starter content, I'll go to props and I'll just find something that looks button like. I could use this mesh here, I could use a corner frame, I think right now I'm just going to use this as my button, this corner frame, this looks like a good button to use. So I'm going to click add, I'm going to go to static mesh and again because I selected the corner frame we can see it there so we'll add that there. So we've got our static mesh in place, now I want to go and add a box component again, exactly how we did with our door. So you'll see we're clicking very similar buttons as we did last time and you kind of get into the flow creating these blueprints. So box collision here, we want to create a box collision and we'll again change the scale of this box so that we make sure we are well within the radius of creating the box. That's going to be the front of my switch on this front side here so the box doesn't really need to go into the wall. So I'm going to drag it out like that a little bit. I'm going to compile and I'm going to save, I'm going to go back into my first person map, maybe let's put this button on this back wall here. So we want to scroll up to where our interactions are, I want to find the button, let's put this button nice in the dead center of this wall here so we can see the button, got plenty of radius for the player to be walking into the button. That looks good. I'm going to move this door over here just for when I'm testing, it's going to make things a little bit easier, not wasting your time just running over the map. I'm going to move my player start here, I'm going to rotate this around. You don't need to do this, I'm just going to make it quicker for us to debug and play test. I'm going to file, save all here. And now how do we add functionality? So if we think about our list of criteria that we want to do, this door is locked, we know it's locked because it's got a tick box so that's locked. Now we want to somehow say to this bool, turn to false don't we? That's essentially what we're looking at here. So we want this button to say to this blueprint, false. So let's see how we can make that work. So we want to go into the button, again we'll do a begin overlap and an end overlap so we're in our button, we'll go to our event graph. I'll just delete any of the existing content here, it's not really needed. Again renaming is good so I'm going to rename this box button overlap just so we know. Again just naming convention, you don't need to do this yourself. I'm going to scroll down, I'm going to create a begin overlap event as we did with the door. I'm going to select the button again, I'm going to create an end overlap. I'm going to right click, I'm going to get the player controller, so get player controller. Same way that we did it before. We want to enable input and again we want to drag down, I'm just holding control on my keyboard as a reminder. So I'm dragging down enable input, I'm going to disable the input. I'm going to control, I'm going to drag down or you can break the link, do it yourself. There we go, so we've got a begin overlap and end overlap, I'm just going to compile and save. We want our interact button, so interact which is there. Now this is where we run into a stumbling block. So what do we want to do? We know we can enable the interaction on this button and we know we can interact with this. If I test it out and say print string and we just say you know button pressed exclamation mark, we'll only do two exclamation marks this time instead of three. There we go. So if I go over to this, okay so I'm pressing E, you can see button press. So we know we've got our basic functionality, same functionality that we added to the door, we've got on the button on the wall now. Now we need to figure out how we're communicating with this door. Now the best way I like to do this is I'm just going to compile and save. I'm going to create a new variable. I'm going to call this door ref. So D-O-O-R, capital R for ref and then call it ref. Now I'm going to hit enter. What I'm going to do is from the Boolean menu, I'm going to type BP underscore door and you'll see I can create a variable which is my blueprint. And so it's a bit hard to see the options here just because I'm in blueprint class. You don't need to click off this but I'm just going to move into some better space to be able to show you here. You'll see BP door, you can create an object reference. Now that would work in and of itself if you ever create an object reference, that's fine to do. I'm going to create a soft object reference because it's just a cleaner way to work and the sooner you can start thinking about the clean workflow, the better. So I'm going to create a soft object reference. I'm going to compile and save. I'm going to drag out the door reference. I'm going to hold control and get. Now you'll see that there's a turquoise looking pin here. I'm going to drag out and type resolve, so R-E-S-O, resolve, hit enter. Now that turns into a blue pin which is great for us. Now we've got a reference to the blueprint door. If I hover over here, it says blueprint door. Now what reference do I want to get? Now if I compile and save this, the reference that I'm trying to get is locked. I want to speak directly to this variable. So in the blueprint, I'm going to type is locked. As soon as I start typing this, you'll see that I have a variable that says set is locked. Now previously we've only done get before. We've only got a variable. Now we want to set the variable. We want to set the locked state to be false. So let's click set. Let's drag up here. Let's press this and is locked false now. So if I look at my map and it's ticked true, is locked true, on my button, I'm going to set is locked to false and let's just double check that it works by adding a print string as we've done before. I'm going to say door unlocked and now I can do three exclamation marks because that's a pretty exciting moment in our level if we can get this door unlocked. Let's save. Let's go back into our map and let's press play. Let's run over here. Let's just check our door first. We press E on the door. Door does nothing. Let's go over here. Door unlocked, three exclamation marks. Now when we go over and we press E, oh, the door does not open. So that's an issue. Let's fix it. That was not as exciting as I intended it to be. But let's have a look here what's going on. So this is a great first tutorial and it's almost like I did this intentionally just as a good teaching moment. So what we'll see here is access none and it actually doesn't know what door it's talking to at the moment. So very easy to fix. But let's just file, save all, let's make sure we got our door working. Now the thing that I didn't do here is I created a door reference. I said door say is locked. No, we don't want the door locked. We want the door to be unlocked. Now it doesn't actually know what door we're looking to here. So let's go back into our first person map and you'll see that when we select the door and we scroll down, can we see our default properties? So what we've not done first is exposed it. So again like we did on this one, let's expose the variable. So let's expose the variable because we want to create a reference. Let's also give it a default property. Let's say, let's call this button properties. Instead of the door properties, let's call this button properties. So let's compile and save. So we've set our properties so we know we're looking for button properties. Again it doesn't matter what name you give that. The important thing here is that we expose the variable. So we've exposed the variable, we've compiled, we've saved. Now when we click on our button, we've got button properties, we've got door reference but it doesn't know what door it's speaking to. If I had loads of doors in this map, again you don't need to do this but if I had loads of doors in this map, that button does not know which door it's speaking to. Let's go to pick connector from the scene, we'll do a little pipette here and we'll click this door. Now it knows it's talking to that door. Now this door is just called BP door. This door here is called BP door 2. Now you don't need to do this but if I pipette this door here, it'd say BP door 2. So you know which door you're speaking to here. So let's just pipette that door so we know we're speaking to this door. Let's save all just in case anything breaks. Let's jump in the game. Now we should be able to get this three exclamation marks. So let's see if we can achieve this. Now we press E, the door doesn't open. We say door unlocked, exclamation mark. Now let's see if this door opens, we'll run over, we'll press E, hey the door's opened. So now we've got some very complex functionality where we've got a button opening a door to progress through the level and that's some quite complex scripting. We've created a new button class, again it's pretty similar to the door but we've added some door referencing functionality. We're setting some bools and we've figured out how to communicate between two blueprints.",
