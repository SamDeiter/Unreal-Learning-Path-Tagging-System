00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Let's talk a little bit about content workflow now.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.600
So the topics we want to cover here are working with the assets inside of Unreal, whether

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.760
we use ready-made assets, which are Starter Pack or the Marketplace or Quixel library,

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.800
or we have custom assets that you're importing yourself via FBX or Datasmith.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.320
And then we'll discuss the Static Mesh Editor.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.080
So some useful hotkeys to use for your viewport navigation.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.760
It might just help to either screenshot this screen or write them down.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
Just some useful buttons here to click whilst navigating the interface.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880
And we'll dive into the editor as well later on as well.

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.440
So the content workflow, we have starter content, which on the bottom left-hand

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.560
side here you can see that when you select some of the project templates,

12
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.800
in the bottom right-hand side you'll see starter content tick box.

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.640
So that will include any content that you might want to use by default for your scenes,

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.040
just to edit content, move them around, manipulate them in your own way.

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
But it just gives you a library of assets to start with there.

16
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.840
We also have the Marketplace, which we referred to on previous slides.

17
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.480
On the top right-hand side here, we have the Marketplace tab on the launcher,

18
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.720
where you can find different files and templates to add to your own projects.

19
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.120
If you see anything on there that you want to add,

20
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.120
you can just click the button add to project.

21
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.960
You might have to purchase it first, but there's a lot of free content on there as well.

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080
And they're easily integrated into your projects.

23
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.320
And it's worth noting that even if you've already got a project

24
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440
and you may want to add some Marketplace content to that,

25
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080
you can always add it to the project after the fact.

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.720
So you can always add more content if need be.

27
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.720
The Quixel library is accessed through the editor as well.

28
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.600
And you can see this on the bottom right-hand side.

29
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.960
And there's lots of information on Quixel and lots of great assets to download,

30
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
all high-quality assets and free to use for Unreal Engine users.

31
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.960
And we can also migrate assets from one project to another.

32
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.720
So it's worth noting that maybe you have some content

33
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.760
you've got in one project that you want to move to another project.

34
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.360
We can actually migrate this information from one project to the next.

35
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080
And I'll show you how to do that in a few slides as well.

36
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.960
So before you export your DCC or your CAD app,

37
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.440
we want to make sure we're using descriptive names for the objects and materials.

38
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.920
So make sure everything is named what it should be.

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.200
Make sure they're not just, you know, a geometry shape underscore 01

40
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800
or any default name and just objects or something like this.

41
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.120
Make sure you have everything named correctly

42
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.880
and the materials assigned how you intend them to be inside of Unreal.

43
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.360
You want to make sure the scene is well organized

44
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.320
and combine any meshes together that you don't need all individualized.

45
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.080
You want to make sure your meshes are clean and consistent with proper UV layout.

46
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.280
You also want to pay attention to objects that have been scaled.

47
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.640
So you want to make sure that everything is just a scale of 111.

48
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.720
And especially so for non-uniform geometry as well.

49
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.880
So ideally everything's coming into the editor at a scale of 111,

50
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.200
which is your scale and your transform and your rotation in a world zero essentially.

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.280
And we want to make sure the scenes, if they're not at world zero,

52
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.480
just move them as close to world zero as you can

53
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
because the further out you get, we get some rounding errors happening.

54
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.200
So just yeah, X, Y, and Z zeroed out there and then reset pivot points

55
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.680
and ensure they're in the right place.

56
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.040
So you can actually reset the pivot points in Unreal Engine.

57
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.760
And there is a tool to do that.

58
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.320
However, it's always good just best practice,

59
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.520
have your assets in the stage that you want them to be at

60
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.120
when they come into Unreal Engine.

61
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.840
You can make edits and manipulate the content inside of Unreal Engine,

62
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.800
but it's best to have them from your DCC app or CAD app

63
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.720
as you intend them to be from the get-go.

64
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.440
So which world to take?

65
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.760
We can use either FBX or Datasmith.

66
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.360
So with the FBX exporter, you manage your system units

67
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.600
if you are planning to use FBX workflows.

68
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.240
We use centimeters as a base unit to match on Unreal Engine system.

69
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.960
So in your DCC app, just make sure your units are set up in centimeters

70
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760
and make sure your objects are centered to the world

71
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000
and that their pivot is zero zero as we mentioned before.

72
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.600
However, with Datasmith, first of all,

73
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.960
you need to make sure you have the exporter for your DCC of choice.

74
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.560
So there's a hyperlink here which you can go to the website

75
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.480
and it has the exporters for 3ds Max or SketchUp

76
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720
or whatever DCC app you're using.

77
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.360
So you don't need to worry as much about the scene units here

78
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.800
because the Datasmith converter takes care of everything

79
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.600
and it also reads and imports your CAD formats natively.

80
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.440
It works well with fully assembled scenes and large data sets.

81
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.360
It's also compatible with more material types that FBX can provide

82
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.080
and you can export full scenes or partial ones.

83
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.320
The simple exporter in the UI can also default to what is only visible on the screen.
