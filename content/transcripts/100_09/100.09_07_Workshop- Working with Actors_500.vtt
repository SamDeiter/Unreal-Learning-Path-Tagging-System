00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
So let's learn how to edit content directly in the browser.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.800
So you can either follow along one to one with this if you have the Unreal Engine open

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.700
or you can just watch completely up to you.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
But for now I'm just going to find an asset in my content drawer.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.960
So I'm going to hit control and space bar and I'm going to scroll to the starter content

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.860
because I included starter content and I'm going to go to the props folder.

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.140
Now what you could do is to get used to some of this functionality you could select content

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.900
for example, go over to the filter button and click that and then go to static mesh.

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.220
And if I click static mesh it will show all the static meshes that are available to me

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.500
inside the browser.

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.920
So you might already have some interesting meshes to work with.

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.420
You might have say for example this damage cart which when I drag it in it's going to

13
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.700
prepare the shaders and build everything and so you might have some more interesting meshes

14
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700
than I have at hand.

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.580
But I'm just going to delete that.

16
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.740
I'm going to go to starter content, I'm going to go to props and I'm going to go to the

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.880
basic chair.

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.680
Now the chair by default faces away from me.

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.620
So the first thing I want to do is rotate it towards me.

20
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.260
So you'll see this widget here which is a transform widget so I can move up, down, left,

21
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.260
right.

22
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.180
So I'm going to move around my viewport by right mouse buttoning and panning my camera.

23
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.460
So holding right mouse button pans the camera.

24
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.980
Left mouse button goes backwards and forwards and holding both mouse buttons goes up and

25
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.980
down.

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.740
So right mouse button plus left mouse button and then just getting the viewport into position

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
you want it to be.

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.380
I don't want to move the location of this, I want to move the rotation.

29
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.860
So I'm going to press spacebar and you'll see that I have the translate widget here

30
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.780
and when I hit spacebar it will go to rotate.

31
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.660
So spacebar is going to rotate and if I press spacebar again it goes to scale.

32
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
So you can see it toggling through these three widgets.

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.400
So I always use spacebar rather than going up to the top here but that covers these three

34
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400
widgets here.

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.400
So I'm going to go to rotate, I'm going to click left mouse button, drag and rotate

36
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600
the chair to a nice angle.

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.560
Maybe I want to scale it down, let's go to the middle of the scale and let's scale it

38
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
down.

39
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680
Now that chair went way too small for the purposes here.

40
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320
So this lets us introduce snapping.

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.400
So you'll see we've got grid snapping at 10, we've got rotation snapping at 10 and

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.200
we've got scale snapping at 0.25.

43
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.120
Now the scale at 0.25 was way too severe so I want to maybe bring it to 0.625 and then

44
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.280
now when I scale it will scale much more gradually and I can get a much nicer result.

45
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160
So that's about right.

46
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.820
So it's just below one and it's just like that's the perfect size for me.

47
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.020
So when I'm snapping whether on the rotation or the grid you can edit each one of those

48
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.320
dependent on the values here.

49
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.000
Now grid snapping is really useful and so I'm going to press spacebar and you'll see

50
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.360
that my chair moves and it feels like it's snapping and that's because of the grid snap

51
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
10.

52
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.840
Now another good functionality of the Unreal Engine is to toggle the grid snapping.

53
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.840
You'll be doing this more frequently I think than the rotation scale but I'm going to hit

54
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.880
the brackets keys next to the enter on my keyboard.

55
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.240
So I'm going to do close bracket for larger and open bracket for smaller.

56
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.260
So just toggle between the two grid sizes and you can see the grid size going up and

57
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.760
down and again I'm just using the brackets keys on my keyboard next to the enter key.

58
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.920
And so now if I set that to 100 it's going to be snapping at 100 and if I set it to 500

59
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.820
it's going to be snapping at 500 units.

60
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.320
So very powerful functionality.

61
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.960
I'm going to snap it here but the one last thing that's frustrating me about manipulating

62
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.400
this content is that it's transforming it in world location.

63
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.040
It's just going left to right up and down but I rotated this chair on an angle.

64
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.440
So how do I change my widget to match the angle?

65
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.800
And that's the last button here that I want to cover which toggles between world transform

66
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.440
and local transform.

67
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.480
So I'm going to toggle this to the local transform and now you'll see it gives me much better

68
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.140
control because it's moving the chair forwards and backwards depending on where I want it.

69
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.760
So hopefully that gives you a good overview of how to add an asset to the scene or you

70
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.880
can use the different widgets to get the content working exactly how you want it to and that's

71
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.120
how to essentially place actors and start manipulating the content.

72
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.480
One last tip though might be worth covering is the camera speed.

73
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.920
So as you're getting more familiar with navigating the interface your right mouse button into

74
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.700
pan around, left mouse button in to dolly backwards and forwards and then both mouse

75
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.900
buttons to move around.

76
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.320
You can also be pressing W, A, S and D on the keyboard.

77
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.900
So W to move forward, S to move backwards, A to move left, D to move right and these

78
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.320
are more traditional PC based controls for editing viewports.

79
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.400
So W, A, S and D I'm now flying around the scene holding right mouse button down.

80
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.220
So again it might take a little bit of time to get used to it but just getting familiar

81
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.160
with that it'll become second nature in no time.

82
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.060
But you'll see as I'm flying around the camera is moving a little bit quick for me.

83
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.580
I want to get a bit slower into this chair so I'm going to select the camera speed, I'm

84
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.160
going to bring the camera speed down to two and now you'll see I'm moving much slower.

85
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.560
So that's really useful to know.

86
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.840
And then a little bonus tip rather than keep going back to the camera speed I always like

87
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.760
to scroll the middle mouse wheel on my mouse so that when I'm moving around I'm scrolling

88
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.500
it up and I'm going faster.

89
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.240
So I've scrolled my mouse wheel up and I'm moving faster.

90
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.440
If I scroll it down it'll really make me move slower.

91
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.040
So editing the content, scrolling the wheel and just getting really familiar with the

92
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.620
W, A, S and D on the keyboard, the left and right mouse buttons on your mouse and then

93
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.280
the mouse wheel will really help you edit your content much faster when you get familiar

94
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.160
with that workflow.
