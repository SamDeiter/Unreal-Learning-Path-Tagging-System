00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
So it's probably worth touching upon the file structure of Unreal Engine just to get yourself

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.240
familiar with how Unreal handles different files and folder structures.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.800
So we'll go over projects and templates to show you how to set them up.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.320
I will also talk about the files and folders and then the overall structure of your projects

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.300
to give you a better understanding.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.520
So first off, tackling projects and templates.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.080
So we have our project browser here where you open the projects.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.760
You'll always start a new project from this location.

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.240
And so essentially what we have is you can see the different tabs on the left hand of

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240
the image.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.860
So you have recent projects, games, film, video, live events, architecture and automotive.

12
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.520
And these are almost different presets that you can select that give you some prerequisite

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.000
information on your projects and how to use different features and functionality.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.840
It is to say that if you select one project type over the other and wish to change, you

15
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.600
can do that inside the engine.

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
However, some of the default configurations will be different and you'd have to go through

17
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.200
and change them all.

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.680
So it's not to say that it can't be done, but it's probably an easier starting point

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.560
to pick the relevant prefab here.

20
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.780
And then you have a series of projects that you can choose from depending on the different

21
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.000
topic area.

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So maybe you just want a blank project that has none of the content in.

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.080
Maybe you want some kind of different preset setup so you can get straight into the work

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.120
that you want to create.

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.760
And then you can do that through the different configurations here.

26
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.200
It's also worth noting that just give yourself a good project name in the bottom right so

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.960
that instead of my project, it's named something you'll remember later.

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.320
It's always good to save the project location on an SSD drive if you have that to hand because

29
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.240
that's going to be the fastest way to access Unreal Engine.

30
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.920
When talking about project files, so essentially if we go over the traditional app workflow

31
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.240
here, we have our software and we save a scene.

32
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.640
Maybe it's in Maya, so we save the scene as a Maya binary file and then it just saves

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.280
as a single file.

34
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.360
So whether you're using Photoshop or Word or Maya, each one has a kind of relevant file

35
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.440
naming system.

36
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.520
So Photoshop or PSDs, Word, doc files, and then Maya, Maya binary files.

37
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.280
And that's how a traditional app would save to visualize your scene inside of the relevant

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280
software.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.880
In Unreal Engine, all assets are imported, whether that be models, textures, audio, animations,

40
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.680
they're all stored in a content folder as UAsset.

41
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.120
So UAsset just means a real asset and they're all stored as individual files that you can

42
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
access.

43
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.440
Levels are saved as UMaps, so the scenes that you are creating are called UMaps, Unreal

44
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.240
Maps, and then the projects are saved as UProjects.

45
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.440
And we'll go over this in a second in terms of the hierarchy here, but they're useful

46
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.000
things to just consider for now.

47
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.960
So if we're looking at the Unreal Engine section, we have the level editor, we have the asset

48
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.920
editor, we have a material editor, and each time you save a file, it will go to its relevant

49
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Unreal Assets.

50
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.120
If you're using the level editor, you've got a Maya level.

51
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.800
If you're using the assets, it's Maya model, or maybe a material, Maya material.

52
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.500
And again, you change these naming conventions, but essentially you're seeing the asset extension,

53
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.300
so UAsset or UMap.

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.000
So that's a useful thing to consider here.

55
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.800
Again, when you're using Maya or Photoshop, you'd export from Maya to an FBX, and then

56
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.760
the FBX comes into Unreal still as a UAsset.

57
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560
Even though you export it as an FBX, it'll turn into a UAsset.

58
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.560
Same with PNGs or PSDs or anything like this.

59
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.680
They'll, well, PSDs won't import, but PNG will go in as a UAsset.

60
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.400
So then talking about the folder structure, where all your files are stored, you'll see

61
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.720
that we've scrolled to our Unreal Projects section in our Documents folder, which is

62
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.040
the default location.

63
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.680
You may have picked a different location, but you'll see there's a config folder, content,

64
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.400
intermediate, saved, and then the UProject.

65
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.480
So the UProject is this blue icon that you'll always double-click to open your project.

66
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.040
And so this will house all the information above, and the UProject is more of a director

67
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.520
to access all these files.

68
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.500
Going through step by step, the config folder stores, as you'd expect, all your configurations

69
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500
of your project.

70
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.620
So if you've changed any settings in the engine, whether it be project settings or engine settings,

71
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.580
maybe you've set up certain inputs for your projects, they'll all be housed in the config.

72
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.340
And you can access these directly from the engine, but the files are stored in the config

73
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.740
folder.

74
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.940
Content is where all the assets are being stored that we were referring to on the previous

75
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.940
slide.

76
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.820
So whether that be animations or models or textures or anything like this, they're all

77
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.340
stored in your content folder.

78
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.700
The intermediate and saved folders, the intermediate is more of a cached folder.

79
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.900
You don't have to take this with you to make your projects work.

80
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.500
Sometimes it can be a lot of gigabytes of information.

81
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.580
And if you didn't copy this across and you only had your config and content folder plus

82
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.540
your UProject, your UProject would likely load.

83
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.080
The saved folder, however, has maybe some saved data in there that you need.

84
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.380
Maybe it's only got auto saves, but if you have exported any movies or you have saved

85
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.960
any screenshots directly from the engine, all this saved information will go into the

86
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.340
saved folder.

87
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.180
So your actual saved files, your saved maps, they are all in the content folder.

88
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.580
Like the main bits of content is still in the content folder.

89
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.920
Saved is just for if you've exported anything from the engine and you've not moved it out

90
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
of that directory.

91
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.060
So just make sure you don't lose any information there.

92
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.440
Again, if it's only auto save data, then you don't necessarily need it for the project

93
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
to run.

94
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.880
So, and then you can see the windows of the materials and meshes folder.

95
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.760
So you can see that they're essentially all just UAssets at this point.

96
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.720
So for the naming convention, we do M underscore for a material, which you see in the middle

97
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720
window there.

98
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.840
And at the bottom window, you see SM underscore, which just means static mesh underscore, and

99
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.000
then you'll see all the meshes.

100
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.780
So essentially, you can see the folder structure and you can see all the individual assets

101
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.020
listed there, which is a really useful viewer, but they're all UAssets.

102
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.860
So they're not their FBX exports or whatever you might have exported these files as.

103
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.860
So it's just useful to consider those.

104
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.620
And then the folder structure, the project structure, sorry.

105
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.820
So the project, that blue icon, the U project that we showed you in the previous slide,

106
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.020
that houses all of this information.

107
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.480
So the project is a container.

108
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.240
It's almost like a wrapper for everything that goes on inside the project.

109
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.720
So then you'll have levels stored where the scenes that you open that you use to edit

110
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.680
the content that you've got in those levels and then act as all the individual assets,

111
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.280
whether they be audio files, animations, static meshes, they're all actors placed in the scene.

112
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.760
So that's just hopefully a useful representation of the project structure and a useful overview

113
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.760
of how the files and projects work.
