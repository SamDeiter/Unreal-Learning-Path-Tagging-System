1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680
And so as we start using Unreal Engine, I've just selected a third person example map from

2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.480
the launcher and from the games tab as well.

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.840
You can select whichever project.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm not going to be using anything specific to this project, but just in case you did

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.200
want to follow along, I've launched the launcher and selected games and then third person template.

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.400
So and yours may look a little bit different depending on which Unreal Engine version you're

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
using as well.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
It's worth noting there.

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.060
But yeah, today we're covering the actual overview of the editor, so nothing should

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.400
be changing and you can also just watch along if preferable.

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.980
So let's talk about the UI and the overall layout of Unreal Engine.

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.160
So at the top here, we've got a few different buttons you'd maybe expect with most pieces

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160
of software.

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.000
You know, in the file menu, you've got a few save and export and options in edit.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.120
It's useful to highlight the editor preferences and the project settings here.

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.240
If you want to change any editor functionality, you can go there, say, binding hotkeys to

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.400
certain buttons or anything like this.

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.960
And any project settings you may want to change when it talks about cooking your projects

19
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.520
or editing the maps or anything like this.

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.920
And then also your plugins can be accessed through here if you're downloading any external

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.440
plugins for use inside of Unreal.

22
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.760
On the window, if you lose any of the side windows that are found around the outside

23
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.520
of the screen here, they can be found from this tab.

24
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.960
So say we didn't have a levels tab open, for example, I could select levels and the

25
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
levels tab appears here.

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.000
I can drag and drop it around, but I can also dock it into any of the windows that I want

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
here.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.800
So it's a really nice snapping system.

29
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.600
I generally put levels up here.

30
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.720
It depends if you work with levels, for example, but like I said, you can find all your windows

31
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.760
here and you can also find your Quixel Bridge and your marketplace here and also save certain

32
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.060
layouts depending on how you're editing your content.

33
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.400
Maybe you want a viewport configured for a certain type of project and you want to change

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.840
different layouts.

35
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440
That's also found in here as well.

36
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.980
So I won't go through every option, but just so you know, you can scroll through those

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.220
lists and find a good overview.

38
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.580
This is your main toolbar here for use inside of Unreal Engine.

39
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.720
So you can save your map, selecting the modes.

40
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.920
When we talk about foliage and landscape later on, we'll be finding them in this browser

41
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.900
here and you can also paint meshes, fractured meshes and also do some BSP editing, which

42
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900
is your binary space partition brush.

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.220
I believe that's what it stands for.

44
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.100
And it's just some basic brush geometry that you can use.

45
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020
You can also find your animation tab here.

46
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.760
We can also quickly add actors to the scene, although you'll notice that we can also see

47
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.540
these actors here as well, but you can add things quickly here.

48
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.420
This is where you will start doing your blueprint visual scripting.

49
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.940
If that's something you need for the use inside of Unreal, you can create cinematics from

50
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.740
this button and I can also press play and I can jump straight into the game here and

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.960
hit escape to come back out as well.

52
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.520
So a few different properties for when you actually want to play the experience and then

53
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.800
you can also package for the different platforms that you want to package there.

54
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280
On the left hand side, we've got our different tabs here.

55
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.000
By default, we've got our place actors selected.

56
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.480
So say we wanted to place a point light, we could just drag and drop this point light

57
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.640
across and it'd be there.

58
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.520
I'll just hit that delete for now.

59
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.720
Some of these actors you'll use frequently.

60
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.360
You've got specific tabs just for lights or basic shapes that you want to drag in.

61
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.320
So if you want a cube, again, it comes with some basic functionality, cinematics, visual

62
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.640
effects, geometry, et cetera.

63
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.880
So a lot of this content can be found that you're placing in the maps here.

64
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.500
Now in terms of your either starter content or content that you're importing directly

65
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.540
inside of Unreal, they can be found in the content browser or the content drawer.

66
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.020
I'm going to find the content drawer now because it's a nice little shortcut inside of UE5.

67
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.220
So I'm going to press control and space bar and it pops up this drawer here, which is

68
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.460
a really nice functionality.

69
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.600
So this is essentially your content browser.

70
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.440
You can find all the content that you've imported here.

71
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.260
So if you did click starter content, for example, you'll probably see all this content.

72
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.920
And if we went to say props, I can double click that folder and I can find a chair,

73
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.220
for example, and place the chair in the scene.

74
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.160
So it's a really nice quick draw to access the content.

75
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.020
And I'm just hitting control and space bar to find that.

76
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.240
You can also have your content browser here, which is pretty much looks the same as a content

77
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
drawer.

78
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.180
So again, you can find the window and then your content browser up here.

79
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.940
You can have multiple versions of your content browser as well.

80
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.500
So if you can't see that content browser window, you can add it from there.

81
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.980
But getting into the habit of hitting control and space bar to find your content drawer,

82
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.000
that really gives you a lot more real estate to work with, especially if you're limited

83
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
on screen space.

84
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.860
You can just pop it open, find the thing that you want and pop it down.

85
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.100
It's worth noting that that can be found inside the blueprint editor, in the material editor.

86
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.180
You can find this window in all the different editors, whereas the content browser is mainly

87
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.140
just in this viewport.

88
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.300
So moving over to the right hand side here, we've got our outliner, which lists every

89
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.580
single actor inside of this map.

90
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.100
So when I select the stairs, it will show the stairs that are selected.

91
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.500
And if I just give this a bit more real estate by scaling it down, you can see everything

92
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.820
is here and everything is labeled inside of subfolders.

93
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.900
And it's just a really nice way to organize everything that is in your scene.

94
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.100
And then showing the details panel here.

95
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.540
So because I've selected some stairs, for example, I can see the static mesh.

96
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.240
I'll just turn this off for now and I'll come back to this favorites thing.

97
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.980
So by default, you'll probably see this screen here.

98
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.480
So you've got transform, location, rotation, scale.

99
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.980
So I can move these transforms here if I wanted to and move that stairs left and right.

100
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.020
I'm just clicking and dragging on those values.

101
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.220
I've just hit undo to undo that by hitting control and C.

102
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.020
But you can see the material that's been assigned.

103
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.380
And essentially, the details panel will give you a good overview of everything that is

104
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.040
in the properties that pertain to this specific actor.

105
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.820
So if I select the character, for example, the character will have different properties,

106
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.380
although some common like the transforms, they'll have different properties pertaining

107
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.660
to that specific actor.

108
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.820
So the details panel is a really nice way to access anything you want to configure per

109
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.820
actor.

110
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.780
Then just coming back to this favorites tab here, it's a really nice feature of Unreal

111
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.860
where you can see there's hundreds of options given on different actors.

112
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.280
And sometimes you just use the same same property by default all the time.

113
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.220
So when I selected the stairs, I favorited the static mesh and the cache shadow properties,

114
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.220
for example.

115
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.380
I don't currently have anything favorited for my character.

116
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.140
So I'm just going to select my character.

117
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.900
You'll see there's nothing in my favorites tab right now.

118
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.180
Say I want to select the skeletal mesh and right click on the skeletal mesh and add to

119
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.500
favorites, you'll now see that the skeletal mesh is in my favorites section.

120
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.300
So if I'm constantly, maybe I'm allowing cloth actors, for example, and I'll scroll

121
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.180
up and now it's allow cloth actors.

122
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.340
If I'm constantly finding details that I want to edit and I have to keep scrolling

123
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.220
up and down, you want to save some of that time, you can add those to your favorites.

124
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.780
So now that we've covered the basic editor overview, let's go into some actual content

125
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.780
editing and using the grid.
