1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
So we're back in our editor now and we're going to create a basic material maybe for

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.280
this chair that we've already got in the scene.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.640
It doesn't matter what actor you've got in the scene but for now I'm going to create

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.640
a material for a chair.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.240
So I'm going to hit control and space bar to bring up my draw.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.400
I'm going to go into my materials folder and if you were following along and you have a

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.560
static mesh filter or any kind of filter enabled here you can just click that off and you can

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.120
see that there's a whole bunch of materials in here.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.480
So I'm just going to create a new one.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.840
I'm going to right click in some free space.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.700
I'm going to go to select material.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.520
So just click in material from the empty space and just following the same naming convention

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.600
I'm just going to go M underscore chair and then I'll hit enter and then hit enter again

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.980
and that opens the material editor.

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.940
Now I want to pin this window next to my third person map just so I can toggle backwards

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.020
and forwards and it's also worth noting if this material didn't open by default for you,

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.940
if you had it deselected you can just hit control and space bar to open your drawer

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.940
again.

19
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.620
I'm going to go back to material and just double click it and then that will open the

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.500
material for you.

21
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.540
So before we were talking about base color we were talking about metallic and we were

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.300
talking about roughness.

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
So let's start with the base color.

24
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.440
Now the base color as we saw before was a vector 3.

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.740
So let's press 3 on our keyboard and left mouse click and that creates a vector 3.

26
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
So again 3 and mouse click and you can right click anywhere like we said in the example

27
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.540
and type in vector and try and find a vector parameter but I'm just going to show you some

28
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.980
shortcuts to make this workflow really work for you as you progress with your material

29
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.460
creation.

30
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.180
So first thing I want to do is I want to left mouse drag from this pin to that pin

31
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780
and so we create a connection.

32
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.380
Next I want to select the node and I want to go to the color and just pick a color,

33
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740
any color that you want from the color wheel.

34
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.140
So I'm just going to go there, I'm going to find a nice lilac pink type color and hit

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.140
OK.

36
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.060
And I'm going to save my material and let it save and then essentially we've just created

37
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.900
our first material.

38
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.900
So if I go back into my third person map I find the actor that I want and I hit control

39
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.380
and space bar and I can get this chair material and just drag and drop it over the chair and

40
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.180
now I have a pink chair.

41
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.580
Now you'll see that the material element has updated on the chair and I could have also

42
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.700
applied the material.

43
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.780
Say I want to favorite this material so I want to right click, I can't favorite the

44
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.060
material element right now but I could also if this, if I reset this value back to its

45
00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.460
default value and that's just using this button I could also open my content drawer, have

46
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.140
this chair material selected, go back to here and plug that in there and it also works.

47
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.380
So that's our basic material right now set up but that's not really PBR, it's not getting

48
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.020
metallic and it's not getting roughness so let's go back into our material and now let's

49
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.380
add a metallic and roughness.

50
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.260
So I'm going to press and hold 1 and left mouse click and I'm going to drag that into

51
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.260
metallic.

52
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.180
I'm going to press and hold 1 and left mouse click and go into roughness.

53
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.160
Now you'll see on this window I'm going to right click to zoom in and out, left mouse

54
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.200
click to rotate but you can see this roughness at 0 and the metallic being at 0 is quite

55
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.920
a nice shiny material.

56
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.160
I'm going to first of all change this to 1 so you can see the result that happens there.

57
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.680
So you can now see it's gone very reflective and again metallic should really be between

58
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.680
0 or 1, the roughness could be a different value so we could put like 0.35 for example

59
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.440
and we bring down that roughness so going from 0 to 0.35 you can see it getting a little

60
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.200
bit more matted and if I went to 1 you could see it even more.

61
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.200
So depending on what value you want you can edit those, again this one more often than

62
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.800
not is 0 to 1, this one can be any version between 0 and 1.

63
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.520
If I save and I go back into my map you'll see that my chair looks a little bit cooler

64
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.160
now it's got a little bit more texture to it, it feels a bit more realistic which is

65
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.880
nice but I still want to edit some more properties maybe on the fly, maybe I want 2 or 3 chairs.

66
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.320
So I'm going to go to my material, first thing I want to do is right click on the colour

67
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.580
and I'm going to convert it to a parameter.

68
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.480
So right click on the actual node and I'm just going to type colour and I'm going to

69
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.960
type it the British way, you can type it whichever way is relevant to you.

70
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.400
I'm going to right click on metallic, convert to parameter, I'm going to type metallic and

71
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.880
we all spell that the same way and I'm going to right click on roughness and you guessed

72
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.120
it we spell roughness the same as well.

73
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.640
So roughness, metallic and colour, so right click on each one, convert to parameter, you

74
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.400
can convert it back to a constant if you want but these all need to be parameters so right

75
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520
click and make sure you select convert to parameter on the top.

76
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.760
Now I'm going to save it and I can actually close this material now, so I'm going to close

77
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.640
it and nothing will have changed on the actual chair yet but the power comes in creating

78
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.080
these child material instances that we were referring to before.

79
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.680
So again I'm going to hit control and space bar, I've got the chair here, I'm going to

80
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.080
right click on the chair and create material instance which is the top.

81
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.200
So make sure you select the actual relevant material and create a material instance and

82
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.080
it just calls it m underscore chair underscore inst.

83
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.400
I tend to name my material instances mi underscore so I'm just going to rename this to mi underscore

84
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.340
chair and then I'm going to call it inst01 as well.

85
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.720
So completely up to you which naming convention you go for, you can see that it separates

86
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.000
the chairs out from the material as well because it's got mi instead of m but I prefer that

87
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.640
approach to have my material instances all in one place so I know that they're an instance.

88
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.600
When you hover over it as well it'll say in brackets material instance.

89
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.120
If you didn't have an opportunity to rename that you can either right click and select

90
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.520
rename or you can press F2 on the keyboard to rename it as well.

91
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.840
So I'm going to file save all right now just to make sure I have all my content saved and

92
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.980
now I want to show you the power of material instances.

93
00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.460
So I'm going to select this chair, I'm going to hold down alt on my keyboard and left mouse

94
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.420
drag to create a duplicate.

95
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.480
I'm going to hold alt again and left mouse drag to create another duplicate.

96
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.800
Now what I want to do is I want to press control and space bar, I'm going to open up this instance

97
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.580
so double click the instance and you can see that I've got a metallic which I'm going to

98
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.620
select on, I've got a roughness and I've got a colour value.

99
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.200
This is all the condensed information of a material instance, this is just a childhood

100
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.820
version of that parent material and you can see that because I converted them to a parameter

101
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.760
they've now got their exposed values and the parent here is that chair.

102
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.540
So I could have called these values anything.

103
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.800
If I went back into the chair and if you're following along you don't need to do this

104
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.020
but I'm just showing you the relationship.

105
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:56.280
If I open the chair material, I'll just pin this here, if I hold down 1 and call this

106
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:11.540
hello and plug it into specular for example and I save, I went into here, I'll have a

107
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.740
hello variable.

108
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.860
So again the name doesn't specifically matter, it's good to keep things named consistently

109
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.180
but it's more just to demonstrate that there's a relationship now between this instance and

110
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.180
that big material.

111
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.500
And so now this is a really nice way to work.

112
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.380
So depending on your real estate you can move the windows wherever you want but I'm just

113
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:40.460
going to show you that by, I'm going to select this material, I'm going to make sure it's

114
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.660
selected in the content browser which is a quick draw.

115
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.540
If you have a second screen you could put this on a second screen.

116
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.420
So I'm going to select the material instance and I'm going to go to the chair, select the

117
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.040
chair and assign that.

118
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.540
So it's the new instance version of the chair.

119
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.420
Now the chair by default will look exactly the same because all these properties are

120
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.860
the same but what I can do now is maybe I want a blue chair or I want a green chair

121
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:12.660
or a gold chair or whatever colour I want I can now manipulate inside of this material

122
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.820
instance.

123
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.420
Maybe I want the metallic to actually be zero in this instance and maybe I want the roughness

124
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:23.260
to be one and I just want that chair to have that desired property.

125
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.580
And so that's a really powerful instance because if you look at the content browser I've not

126
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.940
edited this main material, this still houses all the information but the instance is now

127
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.420
having its own functionality.

128
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.980
So I'm going to right click on the instance, I'm going to click duplicate and it's going

129
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.980
to call it 02.

130
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.480
I'm going to duplicate it again and get an 03.

131
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:54.080
So 02 I'm going to put there, 03 I'm going to select there and let's edit 02 for a second.

132
00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.480
So again I'm just bringing my window down so maybe I want a blue chair, maybe I do want

133
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.440
metallic on full and maybe I want zero roughness so it's just a nice reflective chair.

134
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:16.320
And then maybe the last one I want a, let's call it a red chair again with metallic and

135
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.400
maybe going back down to 0.3 on the roughness.

136
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.880
Let's save that and let's close it and you can see very quickly I can get very different

137
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:30.240
effects and so the material editor can have a whole bunch of parameters that you can change.

138
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.920
We've just done basic base colour roughness and metallic but you can imagine the powerful

139
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.600
functionality that's involved in creating these materials and then material instances

140
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.080
for you to edit content.

141
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.400
So hopefully that was a useful explanation of the material editor and then material instances

142
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.960
so that you can dive into the content yourself and start creating your own.
