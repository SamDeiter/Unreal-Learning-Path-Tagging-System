00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
Just to touch upon some Unreal Engine resources, we have two main places to go for the topics

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.160
here which is the Learning Library and the Epic Games Launcher.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.040
The Learning Management System is a recent addition and here you can follow a guided

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.040
learning path.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.960
There's plenty of content here to dig into and it's also connected to the community which

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.080
is great because you can get feedback on certain information you might need.

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.320
You can also learn from industry experts here, so people will be putting tutorials

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.320
and project samples down here so you can pull them apart and learn for yourself.

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.960
It can also test your knowledge so you can complete the courses and just upskilling the

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.600
areas that you need to.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.840
And you can also build a learner profile used for the same login on the Unreal Engine Launcher

12
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.280
which I'll get into in a second but it's a really nice centralized place for your learning

13
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.840
resources here.

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.400
And then the Epic Games Launcher, so you can learn about upcoming features, you can see

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.040
the live streams that are currently happening.

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.120
We've got featured content that might inspire some of your projects.

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.480
You can access the Marketplace from here which is a tab at the top of the Launcher there

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.020
in the middle section of the tabs.

19
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.200
You can install engine updates so get the latest version of the Unreal Engine and you

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.480
can also access your Marketplace downloads from here for use in your own projects.
