00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
Hello, and welcome to today's training on the first project in Unreal Engine for Automotive.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.520
And today we're going to be breaking this into two parts.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.080
We'll go over UEFI basics in part one, which includes how to open the launcher, projects

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.000
and templates, the UI of the engine and the navigation of the engine, and placing and

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.200
transforming objects.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.160
Just basically getting familiar with the engine and learning how to place and move things

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.400
around.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.320
And then we'll go over importing some data.

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.200
Then in part two, we'll cover some lighting materials and the landscape and foliage tool.
