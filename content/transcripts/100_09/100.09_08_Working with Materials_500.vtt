00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120
Now that we're familiar with placing actors and navigating Unreal Engine, let's talk

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.720
about working with materials and how we actually get some desired results from Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.160
So the topics we'll cover here are the real-time material concepts, we'll talk about what PBR

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.880
is and we'll also talk about parent materials and also material instances. So parent materials

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.680
being the primary PBR inputs, the node settings and exposing the different parameters and

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.800
then with material instances, it will talk about almost being a childhood version of

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.640
this parent material which is a more simplified interface and we can create multiple versions

8
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.640
of lighter, in this instance, more optimized materials based on that parent.

9
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.360
Real-time material concepts, essentially starting off as what is a material? It is essentially

10
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.040
an asset applied to a mesh to control its visual look. In its simplest form, think of

11
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.080
it as paint with various properties such as color and finish. So if we see on the right

12
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.360
hand side here, we'll see our paint brush and our bucket and tin, should we call it,

13
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.280
and we'll be able to paint a certain surface and let's say we decide that this surface is glass.

14
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.680
Now the eye looks at the glass and glass has reflective properties and it reflects a lot of

15
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.080
light as well. So you'll see the surface next to it bounces off that light and it creates some

16
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.760
reflection and inside of Unreal Engine, we define these properties of what we want glass to look

17
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.400
like. Whereas when we have chalk, if we set certain parameters on the material to say we want this to

18
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.840
be chalk, it disperses the light, it's much more of a matte material, there's not as much bounce

19
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.640
going off the light and especially in one direction. So there's a clear difference between how we want

20
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.800
glass to look and how we want chalk to look and we can define that all within Unreal Engine. So

21
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.160
material defines how the light interacts with the surface it is applied to essentially. And then

22
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.780
talking about PBR, PBR is a unified lighting and shading system. So it's a better approximation

23
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.880
of light and materials for physical interaction. So it's very intuitive and consistent, you get

24
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.640
specific results from using PBR, it's physically accurate and uses real-world physical measurements.

25
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.280
So PBR is a combination of you creating the materials, setting up the lighting how you

26
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.840
want it to be set up and also the exposure used within the scenes which is controlled

27
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.200
through the post-process. Looking at the material editor as an overview, you'll see a whole bunch

28
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.480
of nodes here connected into this master section here. So we can set up various parameters, maybe

29
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.960
we want to change the texture coordinates of a texture and we want to offset the texture maybe

30
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.440
and then maybe we want to add some contrast through a linear interpolate and we want to

31
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.800
set a base color for certain samples and maybe we want to add a normal map to it. Again these

32
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.160
materials can get super complex, we'll go over a basic material setup in a few slides here. But

33
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.000
you can see there's a lot going on under the hood when we can set up materials, a lot of

34
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.680
power and flexibility. You can also decide on certain material properties down on the

35
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.600
bottom left heel. So what type of material domain is it, is it a surface, what type of blend mode

36
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.040
do you want, do you want an opaque material, do you want a transparent material, what kind of

37
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.960
material do you want to set up and then also what shading model do you want it to use and there's

38
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.280
a lot more functionality as you scroll down the list in the material editor to get the desired

39
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.520
results of what you want there. When we're talking about PBR, the primary inputs you're talking about

40
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.400
are base color, metallic and roughness. So base color is some kind of flat color without

41
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.240
specularity, it's a linear RGB which is a vector 3 and the values are between 0 and 1. The metallic

42
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.040
input, so you'll see these base colors, you'll see metallic and you'll see roughness down here on the

43
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.520
right hand side but the metallic is a grayscale value that will range from 0 to 1 and more often

44
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.880
than not you really want the metallic value to be either 1 or 0. So when 1, its specular reflection

45
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.040
is at 100% so it's the most metallic version, 0 is the least metallic version. And then roughness,

46
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.400
grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1 and you can actually transition through this area on 1

47
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.880
in the roughness so you could have you know 0.35 for example but it ranges from smooth, mirror-like

48
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.280
to a rougher more matted surface. So depending on the roughness of the material that you want

49
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.480
you can manipulate that property to have the desired result that you want.

50
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.800
We have a lot of different parameters available to us, we can right click anywhere in the material

51
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.760
editor and again I'll be creating a basic material in a few slides here but you can right click

52
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.640
anywhere in the material editor and create you know vector parameters, anything you need

53
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.680
as well as change the parameter values on each of the nodes that you create. So say you created

54
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.000
this vector 3 parameter here, you could select it and then set the colour, a lot of powerful

55
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.640
functionality which I'll be going through in a second and so and then you can create a material

56
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.480
instance that we spoke about at the start. So material instance is still a version of this

57
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.880
master material but it's got certain parameters exposed like brightness for example which we can

58
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.480
manipulate based on the parent properties but it's just a much more optimized unified way of

59
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.200
working. So let's go into Unreal, let's create a basic material, let's show you the different

60
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:52.320
options and then let's create a material instance for that as well.

61
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.720
you
