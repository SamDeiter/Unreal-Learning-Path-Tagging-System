00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
As we close out the course, we thought it might be useful to go over some lighting terminology

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.900
and the types of lighting so that it gives you a better idea about this PBR workflow

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.400
and how you can use it in your scenes.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.440
So the topics will cover the lighting definitions and the behavior of the lights, we'll talk

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.240
about static versus dynamic and the different light types you can have in your scenes.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.400
So lighting terminology, we essentially have three different types of lighting definitions

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
and behaviors.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.880
We have the direct lighting, we have indirect or bounce lighting and then the shadows.

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.000
So if you look at our top right hand image here, the direct lighting, you'll see that

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.060
the light is directly falling upon the surface without any interference and the light travels

11
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.360
directly to the surface that the surface receives the full color of spectrum of light.

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.000
So the indirect lighting therefore is if you drop down and you see the second image, you'll

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.560
see that there's some indirect lighting going on just on the underside of that surface.

14
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.600
So lighting that has been reflected by other surfaces nearby, as light bounces off these

15
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.120
surfaces, light waves are absorbed or reflected based on the surface properties and passed

16
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.040
onto the surface you are looking at.

17
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.700
So indirect lighting contributes to the mood and overall light intensity.

18
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.960
So when you have this balance between not only the direct lighting and the indirect

19
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.920
lighting, you get a much nicer result.

20
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.360
But then let's talk about these shadows a little bit on the underside here.

21
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.600
So shadows happen when Unreal Engine takes a snapshot of a mesh actor from the light's

22
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.000
point of view and projects that information onto another mesh on the opposite side.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.980
So we still have control and functionality assigned to shadows and we can change the

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.940
properties of shadows inside the engine as well.

25
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.340
So that's just an overview of the different types of lighting we're looking at.

26
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.080
So when we're talking about static versus dynamic lighting, we have a few different

27
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.200
options available here.

28
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
So the bait lighting is pre-computed rendered lighting.

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.420
So we bake lighting using Unreal Engine's Lightmass Radiosity Baker.

30
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.220
It's similar to render if you've used V-Ray or Corona, anything like this is similar to

31
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.320
those types of approaches where it's pre-baked and it is used to create high quality indirect

32
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.500
lighting using lighting shadow maps.

33
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.660
So it's always baked lighting and it cannot be altered at runtime and it has little impact

34
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.920
on the real-time performance.

35
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.940
So if you want the most optimized scenes, the bait lighting is the approach you want

36
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.660
to take there.

37
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.020
Real-time or dynamic lighting is lighting that is updated each frame.

38
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.260
So it's fully dynamic and can be moved around and modified at runtime.

39
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.540
It has no global illumination component, only the direct light and it's also expensive to

40
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.280
use because it affects the real-time performance because we're rendering each frame.

41
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.740
So Unreal Engine can use a blend of both static and dynamic lighting for archviz projects

42
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.200
or where assets are typically stationary, the bait static lighting is mostly used.

43
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.160
So say you had a scene where you used 85% static lighting, maybe 15% dynamic lighting

44
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.800
and then you can have those little bits of dynamic effects where you need them, but the

45
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.480
majority of the scene might be static.

46
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.040
And then touch upon ray tracing, this type of lighting is used as real-time global illumination

47
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.480
updated with all lights to set to movable.

48
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.640
So if they are animated, the global illumination GI updates on the fly.

49
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.400
The main lighting types, when we were looking at our place actors tab, which is the place

50
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.640
actors section, you'll see that the lights has its own tab as we touched upon before

51
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.480
where you can find the directional lights, point lights, spotlights, rect lights, just

52
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.360
a rectangle light and a skylight.

53
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.160
So these are the main different types of lighting that you'll have access to.

54
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
You can use a directional light for something like a sunlight or a moonlight.

55
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.960
And again, with each one of these light properties in the details panel, then you can modify

56
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960
any properties.

57
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.560
Maybe you want to change the color or the shadow color that they're creating.

58
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
Maybe you want to change the intensity or even the rotation of the sunlight.

59
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
You can do all that through the details panel.

60
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.080
The point lights, single points of light in a scene.

61
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.060
And you can also edit these to extend the capsule.

62
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.840
So by default, point lights come with a spherical radius and you can actually change the point

63
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.280
light to be more of a cylindrical radius if you want it to be more like a fluorescent

64
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.480
tube light, for example.

65
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.560
So point lights have their own functionality and very powerful.

66
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.480
And maybe for a lot of the time, you might have lots of point lights in a scene.

67
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.960
Maybe you have a hundred point lights in the scene and maybe, you know, eighty five of

68
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960
the point lights are statically lit.

69
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.000
And then you have, you know, the fifteen remaining that are dynamically lit.

70
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.500
And the important thing about both point lights and spotlights as we move on to spotlights,

71
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.860
you don't want too many overlapping dynamic spotlights or point lights.

72
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.220
So if you're using dynamic lighting, make sure the dynamic point lights are spaced apart

73
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.860
and they're not all too crumped together and overlapping each other with their radiuses.

74
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.560
So talking about spotlights, spotlights are very similar functionality as point lights,

75
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.100
but they just are more in a cone shape and they spot the light and then similar with

76
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.420
a rectangle light.

77
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.180
So you can have this box light that is useful for maybe archviz projects or anything that

78
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.860
you're doing that you need a big wall light essentially.

79
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.740
And then you got the skylight, which is a HDR image based ambient light, which just

80
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.540
gives you an overall lift to the scene.

81
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.340
So if we're looking at a daylight setup, the main components here, we have direct light,

82
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.860
we have sun, we have skylight and we have the sky sphere or dome mesh visuals.

83
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.580
So other components might be a light mass importance volume, a post-process volume,

84
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.180
atmospheric, you know, the fog or sky atmosphere or the sphere reflection captures, which will

85
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.860
process any reflective surfaces and create the relevant reflections for those surfaces.

86
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.420
So you can see a really nice diagram here of all these different components kind of

87
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.300
layered in to create the intended result that you want.

88
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.020
And so you use a combination of all the different lights to create your scenes.

89
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.580
So just to give those lights a little bit more context, if we're in our scene here,

90
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.220
I'm going to speed up my camera and I'm going to zoom out a little bit to give us more view

91
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.220
here.

92
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.020
So you'll see that the angle of the shadows, for example, is coming from this chair.

93
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.980
Now in your outliner, you'll be able to find the different lights if you've choose a custom

94
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.740
preset.

95
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.140
You might have more properties than this depending on the Unreal template, especially in Unreal

96
00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:03.020
5, you'll have the daytime real time components here as well.

97
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.340
But if we're just looking at the light source, for example, for now, which is a directional

98
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.460
light, which we can drag into the scene with a directional light, just drag and drop.

99
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.380
For example, you can see the rotation on the yaw.

100
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.180
So as I change the rotation, you'll see the sky, the sun moving rotation.

101
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.220
So I could rotate this to a different direction, for example, if I wanted to change the pitch

102
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:35.540
to get deeper shadows, for example, I want to just undo that value.

103
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.940
It's on 66, so let's call it minus 80 for now.

104
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:47.020
And then you'll see the sun rising, so minus 40 might give a deeper shadow.

105
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.780
So you can see already that the sun is almost setting in the sky.

106
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.340
And then maybe I scroll down and change the light color to more like a warmer evening

107
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.300
hue, for example.

108
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.060
So that's essentially a directional light.

109
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.220
And then we've got the skylight here, which again, we can give it an overall color, we

110
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.060
can show how it affects the world.

111
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.900
You can change the intensity in any one of these.

112
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.820
We've got the post-process volume as well, if you want to change any post-processing

113
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.820
effects.

114
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.140
And then a light mass importance volume can be found from the place actors.

115
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.820
And you only really need to use a light mass importance volume if you're using baked lighting.

116
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.820
So if you want your scene to be baked and pre-rendered, what you can do is you can place

117
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.900
this volume in your scene.

118
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.940
So you can just drag and drop the importance volume.

119
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.660
It comes in as a small cube for now.

120
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.740
And if you scroll down to the brush settings here, you can make these boxes bigger, depending

121
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.740
on the scene, and only highlight the main bits of areas that you need lighting in.

122
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.980
And it basically says to Unreal, control this scene and just only focus on the lighting

123
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.020
within this box, and everything else can just be rendered usually.

124
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.460
So including your light mass importance volume for baked lighting is also useful.

125
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.260
And then just touch upon the point light and the skylight here.

126
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.860
I'll zoom in, and we have a point light, which we can move around the scene.

127
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.540
It's dynamic by default, and it's casting nice shadows.

128
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.380
We can maybe change the intensity or the color or the radius.

129
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.700
So you may want to bring the radius down so it's a smaller light or a bigger light.

130
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.980
Again, just playing with some of these properties will be the most beneficial, I think.

131
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:40.060
And so the main thing to take away from these lights are the mobility here, which we were

132
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.100
referring to before.

133
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.780
So you can either have static lighting where it gets baked in, and this light will then

134
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.020
not be able to move at runtime.

135
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.200
If I have movable, this is fully dynamic so I can animate this in my scene.

136
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.340
For example, I can move it around and create real-time shadows, again, based on those lighting

137
00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.620
types that we spoke about.

138
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.720
But the important note here is a stationary light option.

139
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.940
And if we hover over it, a stationary light will only have shadowing and bounce light

140
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.340
from static geometry baked by light mass.

141
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.960
So part of this light is baked, but all of the lighting will be dynamic.

142
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.900
So it can change color, it can change intensity.

143
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.980
So it can't move, but it can allow partially-baked lighting, and it can also change at runtime.

144
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.940
So if we wanted to move this light...

145
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.020
So say we didn't want to move the light around the scene, but it was just there, but we did

146
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.900
want to change this light from orange to blue at runtime, we could do that with a stationary

147
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.900
light.

148
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.540
It's worth noting the three different light types, and by default, you probably want static.

149
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.660
If you do want movable, just make sure you're using these sparingly.

150
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:56.100
And stationary is a nice balance between the two if you want some dynamic elements, but

151
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.580
you don't need to move it around.

152
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.980
So hopefully that helps give a good overview of the different lighting types inside of

153
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.380
Unreal.
