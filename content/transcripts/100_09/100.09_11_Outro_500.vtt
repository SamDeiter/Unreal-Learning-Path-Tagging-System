00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
So thanks for following along with this course today.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.040
I hope you found it useful as a nice editor overview and navigating the view part and

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.060
the different buttons that you can use to access, creating new materials and just editing

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.280
the content to give the visual representation of how you want things to look as well as

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.360
touching upon lighting and knowing how to manipulate the scenes with the different parameters

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.360
and properties.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.560
Hopefully it was a really good overview and then you can of course continue on the course

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.680
journey and learn all the more detailed features of Unreal Engine.
