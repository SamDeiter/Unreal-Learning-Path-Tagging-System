  "text": " Now that we have our control rig built the way that we need it for our animation, we're going to add it into a sequence. Once we put it into a sequence, we'll be able to animate using all of the controls we've added previously. I'm going to start by going up to the Cinematics dropdown and choosing Add Level Sequence. Then I'm going to choose a folder to put it in and give it a quick name. Now that it's been created, all I need to do is go to my Content Browser and drop this Audi drivable skeletal mesh into the scene. I'm not going to put the control rig in directly, instead I add the skeletal mesh via a Track, then go to Sequencer, Add Audi drivable, and as long as it's selected you should see it right up here. If it's not selected you'll still see it here in the dropdown. Select Add Audi drivable and then this is how we're going to add our control rig. There's a plus track option and then a control rig, asset based control rig, Audi drivable underscore control rig. That's the one we just created. Once we select that track, we should now have a dropdown for these controls and also we'll see we have an animation menu. We can see the controls up here as well and animation details. At this point we're ready to animate so we can just fly in for a better view. Select any part we want to animate here, just select it right there in the scene, you can select it down here or up here in the animation panel. Once you've selected it, just hit S or enter to keyframe it. You can also hit this little plus button right here and that will give you a keyframe on frame zero. Then we're going to drag this forward to any frame in the future basically that we need to animate to. Then we're going to position this again using the control rig and then I'm going to hit S again and then I can drag between these. We can see it's now animating in the editor. Let's say this is actually an animation that we think is good enough to be finalized and put out into a final product. So I can scroll back up here to the top where it says Audi drivable. Well on this track, the kind of parent track to everything, when I right click on it, I'm going to get an option in here for bake animation sequence. So I want to click on that. What this is going to do is allow me to save this out as an animation asset. So let's save this to the animation folder and hit OK here. In the export options, we're going to get an option here called record in world space. Now you can check this on and it's going to give this a position that's going to be offset from the origin and if we leave it unchecked, it's going to use itself as the origin and it's not going to move away from itself. So I'm going to leave that unchecked for now and hit export animation sequence. And then I can click in this lower right button, open Audi drivable, and here it is, my final animation. And this can now be reapplied as an animation track inside of Sequencer. This could be an additive animation we use later for a door opening and closing animation, but it's up to you to decide how you want this to be applied. Now you have the tools and I hope you have fun with them.",
