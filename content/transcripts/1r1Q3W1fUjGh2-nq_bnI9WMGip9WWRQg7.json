  "text": " In this video, we'll start looking at real-time lighting in Unreal Engine and working with post-processing volumes. An easy way we can start changing the rendering settings for our level is by adding in a post-process volume. This will allow us to create specific overrides for rendering settings when we are within the volume, or we can also enable the checkbox for infinite extend to apply these settings to the entire level, whether we're inside the volume or not. The two things we're going to look at here are the exposure settings and the bloom settings. In my own personal experience, I find that the auto exposure that is set by default in Unreal Engine can make it a little difficult when trying to balance all of your different lights and get a specific look like evening or nighttime inside of your game. By switching it to manual and changing our exposure compensation, we can get more of an evening look. Then as well, we can affect the power of bloom in order to make our stage pillars glow even brighter. Let's take a look. We can add a post-process volume quickly from the add actor button up here, coming down to visual effects instead of volumes. Click and drag our post-process volume into the level. So it doesn't look like anything's happened. Right now it still has all the same default configurations as what we see around us, and we're also outside of the box. To give you an example of what this might look like, we'll change our exposure compensation here to 0.1 when we are in our metering mode to manual. Actually, we can just leave this at 1. And so when we go in the box, very dark suns up there. Out of the box, very bright. So what if we want to see this though throughout the entire level? Like I mentioned a minute ago, we can search for infinite extend, have that enabled, and now the entire scene will be affected by these settings that we apply here in the volume. So I'm going to bring this up though. 10, maybe 8. And I also want to change our bloom, which we were looking at up here. And change the intensity of the bloom to 0.8, and we'll see that the glow from our pillars has gotten a little bit brighter. I think we can also change our lighting here too by working with the position of our sun. We can make our sun go a little bit down lower. I think it's, here we go. Get some cool evening sky going on here. Yeah, that'll be good. And we can also change the intensity of our sun here as well. We want to see a little bit more of an afternoon light. And I think maybe let's ramp up the bloom a little bit more for today. Process volume, let's put that to 1. Or even 2, we can see that that's doing a little more clearly. We're unchecked versus checked. A little subtle for now, but that's okay. So now that we have our manual exposure set, let's add in a few more lights and tweak their settings in order to get the look that we're going for inside of a scene. So to add light actors, once again, we can come here to our add actor button, search for lights. We already have a directional light in the scene and it's recommended to not have more than one. So instead, I'm going to add a spotlight. And we can see its cone coming down. I'm going to add this spotlight, I think, kind of off to the front over here. We can angle it by pulling up our rotator gizmo. I'm going to change its intensity to 12. Let's try 20. 40, there we go. Let's rotate it a little bit more. I'm going to do an alt drag off of it. Come over to the other side. Maybe down a little more. Rotate it around. There we go. It's looking a little bit more square on there. We'll make this one a little cooler, give ourselves kind of a three-point lighting setup. We'll drag this one off over here. Also bring it down over this way. Bring it back around to face our dancer. Up, over. We can also, let's maybe change our outer cone angle and make it a little bit brighter or narrower so we can really hone in on our character here. Okay. I think that's looking pretty good. Let's maybe bring up our... Obviously you can go all day fiddling around with these settings. We'll keep it a little more tight here. That's zero. Yeah, that's cool. Awesome. In the next video, we'll take a look at some of the modeling tools in Unreal Engine and how we can use them to modify the meshes in our project.",
