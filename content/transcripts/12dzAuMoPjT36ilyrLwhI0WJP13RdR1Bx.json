  "text": " All right, in this section, let's talk a little more about the real-time pipeline by focusing on collaboration. So how do we handle the organization of all the UAsset files? In traditional workflows, the data pipeline can be rather decentralized, meaning it can be spread across many servers and departments. Unreal addresses this issue by creating a depot of UAsset files, and this depot is managed by programs like Perforce, Subversion, or GitHub. Data is synced between the depot and local copies of the data on local workstations, as the preference here is to work on local copies of the data to ensure optimal performance. As artists check out files from the depot and make changes, once completed, those files are pushed back up to the depot where a new changelist is created. Then the other artists on the team can synchronize their copies of the data to the new changelist. To help the source control process along, we can provide Unreal Game Sync as a customized wrapper that controls and monitors Perforce, manages and creates changelists, records notes, and triggers the syncing process using a simplified user interface. Epic Games implements the Unreal Game Sync in projects for Fortnite and in ICVFX workflows where the entire process of handling the batch import of models into Unreal Engine from Maya initially had to be done manually. Additionally, Python tools can also be implemented with Unreal Game Sync to improve workflows. So when working with others, you'll export your final Maya FBX for import into Unreal Engine. And then when working with Unreal Engine, you will save over the file that you were currently working on instead of saving a new file. Think of it like a versionless master for each item that is brought through into the engine. Similar to a master file you would have to import into Maya. The files that are imported into Unreal Engine should be the final version of the asset, and you should always import and overwrite files as having multiple versions checked in can lead to all sorts of confusion. It is recommended that Unreal Game Sync and Perforce be implemented to handle version control. However, if you cannot use source control, then there are a number of other options available so that you can share work with others. Another tool that can be used alongside Unreal Engine is ShotGrid, formerly ShotGun. ShotGrid can be fully integrated into Unreal Engine and used for production project management, version control, or collaborative review. The only requirements are a ShotGrid license and the activation of the ShotGrid plugin from inside Unreal Engine. One thing to note is that complete integration is still considered to be in beta, so use this tool with some caution in your production. Finally, Universal Scene Description, or USD, is a tool that you can access through the window pulldown, selecting Virtual Production and choosing the USD Stage option. USD integration in Unreal is still in the early stages at this moment, and the USD plugin must be activated for implementation. All integration is on the horizon, but you should still consider this feature as currently in beta, even though we do support the use of USD Stage Actor, USD Stage Editor, Python support for USD Import and Export, along with support for payloads and variants. Okay, that's it for this section. In our next section, we will continue exploring Unreal Engine as we discuss the engine's project logic.",
