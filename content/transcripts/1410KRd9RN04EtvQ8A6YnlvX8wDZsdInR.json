  "text": " Let's jump into some mesh optimizations now. So the first thing you want to do in your DCC app, whatever you might be using, whether it's Maya or Max or another software, you want to make sure UE5 correlates to your grid inside this DCC system. So UE5 uses centimeters for unit measurements. So one unreal unit is one centimeter. So just make sure your scene is set up and scaled to centimeters in your external package there. When looking at the use of Nanite, which is Unreal Engine 5's new mesh based system, you can see that when we have a proxy mesh, that fidelity, especially on that wood grain, gets lost a little bit. But as soon as we have a Nanite mesh where we're getting this extra level of fidelity and we're throwing everything at the scene, and Unreal Engine 5 can handle millions of polygons being thrown at the scene, and it will make some affordances and some optimizations to how the meshes are rendered. But you can see a really strong use of why you might want to use Nanite on your meshes here. So to talk a little bit about Nanite, when you import on the FBX options, you can build Nanite for the per asset basis on your import FBX settings. Then in your static mesh editor, so when you double click the static mesh from the Content Browser, you can see the details panel and you'll see the Nanite settings here and whether it's enabled. And then you've got a couple of different options that you can change there. And then you can also create geometry collections, which Nanite can batch certain assets together. So if we select a few different assets and we say, OK, Nanite, enable Nanite here, we can then have collections of this geometry that are grouped together, which Unreal can then make some affordances for as well. So Nanite isn't supported just out of the box on every single mesh type. Nanite works fantastically on static meshes and instance versions of static meshes and hierarchical instances of static meshes and also geometry collections. However, we can support skeletal animations right now, morph targets or any world position offsets in materials, spine meshes, custom depth or stencils, vertex painting on instances, any decals or custom UVs. These are not currently supported. So again, if you're trying to do any kind of transparency or skeletal meshes, anything like this, Unreal doesn't currently support Nanite out of the box. But for any kind of fixed static mesh based geometry, Nanite works excellent for that. When looking at optimization as well, we want to think about limiting overdraw. So especially on this foliage actor, for example, you can see that Unreal, even though we've technically got a bit of asset in every box here, we'll end up getting a little bit of overdraw, especially when we've got these layered on top of each other and Unreal needs to render something behind this static mesh, for example. So on the right hand side here, you can see that we've tried to optimize the plane a little bit just to say, OK, only render what's within this surface here. And therefore, if we're looking at this right hand image and on the left top left hand side of that image, you can see that if there was something placed behind that, Unreal would render that first and it would render it without an extra alpha render pass. So you can instantly see that, especially as these layers stack up, you're getting a lot more, well, you're limiting the effect of overdraw depending on the complexity of the scene. So really good to consider just how you're laying these static mesh planes in your scene and making sure you're trying to limit that overdraw. And then you can also make some level of detail adjustments. So if you get a default reduction on your mesh here, you'll see that it deforms the mesh a little bit. Maybe this is OK for your default reduction. Again, the level of detail depends on what you need from your scene. But it's a good setting if you have some bone priority reduction so that it preserves that mesh a little bit. So a level of detail and meshes can be found on lots of different types of meshes. However, again, it's up to you which approach you take there.",
