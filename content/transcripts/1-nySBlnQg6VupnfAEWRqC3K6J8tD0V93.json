  "text": " Hello. In this class, we'll be learning about advanced nodes effects in translucent materials and specifics to be aware of when applying them to our scenes. There are no slides for this lesson, so let's jump straight into the engine. All right, we're in the blurred glass section of our default map. And here you can see two different preview meshes with the same material assigned. This material is supposed to be replicating a frosted glass look, and it's using a node called Sparrow Blur, which is actually a material function. Now, if I switch my mode from Lit to Shader Complexity, we can see that, similarly to the rest of our translucent material, this shader has a high computational cost, especially if you start overlapping multiple translucent objects on top of each other. That's really where it gets bright pink, which is the heaviest you can get. The demand of this material doesn't just come from its translucency properties, but also from the Sparrow Blur node itself that it was created with, which has a quite high performance overhead. So make sure to use it with caution in your environments if you plan on using this material. Okay, we have our preview mesh selected, and now in the details panel, we can just double click on the material assigned to it to open it up. Okay, I'm just going to undock it over here, and then I'm going to just zoom a little bit into this plane. Now, we have two values that we can play around with in this material instance. One is the amount, and the other one is connected to the temporal anti-aliasing radial blur. Now, if we slide around the temporal AA, we can see that it's not really affecting the visuals of this material. And that's probably because it should be used in conjunction with other settings and parameters of the Sparrow Blur that weren't exposed to the material instance. So I'm just going to turn it off and focus on the amount. So if we focus on these defined outlines of the cube, which is behind this plane, and then I start increasing the amount value or the intensity of my blur, you can see that the outlines of the cube become less and less perceivable. And as I slide it down, they get real crisp and defined. Let's stop this material instance back here and open up its parent material to see how it was developed. All right, so we kept this material quite simple, and really most of it revolves around this Sparrow Blur material function. Now, this node being a material function allows us to double click on it and then open it up and see how it was developed. This is a really cool technique to peek under the hood of the engine and see how its developers developed this expression. Now, it's really important that we keep these material functions intact and we don't apply any changes to them because they're directly connected to the engine content. So if you move some nodes around or if you unplug some pins, make sure to either reconnect them or when you close down this material function to not save any changes. All right, talking about the Sparrow Blur material functions, we actually have two different nodes that we can use based on our needs. If we right click in an empty area of the graph and we type Sparrow Blur, we can see that we could we can either select the Texture option or the Scene Texture. And I'm just going to pop off with them here. Now, the Texture Sparrow Blur is really connected to textures and image samples, while the Scene Texture is connected to the camera and the scene. Now, as I just mentioned, we kept this material quite simple and we also haven't exposed a lot of its settings to parameters. So we don't have them at our disposal here in the Material Instance. But this doesn't mean that you can't go in and expose them yourself, change the color and just test out the settings of this Sparrow Blur. So the aim of this lesson was really to spark your curiosity and demonstrate how to use your curiosity and demonstrate yet another kind of look and feel that you can achieve using Translucent Materials. That was it for this lesson and in the next video, we'll be learning about two-sided foliage materials and how they're set up. I'll see you there.",
