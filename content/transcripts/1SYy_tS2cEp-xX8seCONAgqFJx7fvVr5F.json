  "text": " So in order for us to actually animate and move the door, we first need to get a reference to it into the event graph. And we do this by going up into the component panel, left clicking on door mesh, and then just dragging it into the event graph. And when you let go, you'll see that a reference has appeared that we can use within our code. Once you've got hold of this on your event graph, you can see that you've got the little blue node at the end. Now if you drag off of that, we're going to be able to get hold of a number of different functionalities and make any changes that we want to this component. That could include changing its location, scale, size, or we could alter the material or even change the mesh itself if we wanted. In this case, I'm left clicking and dragging away, and I'm going to search for set relative rotation. So we want to set the relative rotation rather than the absolute rotation. And that means it's going to be relative to the door frame itself. This way, the door, when we make it rotate, is always going to stay in place connected to the door frame. And the actor itself, we're going to be able to place anywhere in the world at any different And the door will still stay relative to the frame and look correct. The rotation that we actually want to change is the Z rotation. So if in this instance, we change the Z to 90, and we connect this up, it should open the door to 90 degrees from the door frame. We don't want to touch the X or the Y because these are rotated in a very odd degree. So if we connect this up after the print string on E, that means what we will do is when we hit E, it's going to print used door, and it's going to rotate the door itself to 90 degrees. Now if I hit compile and I press play, we should be able to open the door once. So I go in, I hit E and the door opens. I can't hit E again to close it again. Instead, it just keeps saying used door. In order to close it back, we're going to need to go back into the code. If I move the print string and the event back a little bit, then if I highlight the set relative rotation node, press Ctrl C to copy it and press Ctrl V to paste a copy below. Now I can connect this set relative up to the same door mess and set the Z rotation back to zero. Now this node should reset the door to its original position. Now here's where we're going to use our first flow control node. Sometimes you might want to control the way that the code works, dependent on different pieces of logic. In this case, we are going to use something that's referred to as a flip-flop. What a flip-flop will do is the first time that it is encountered, it will go off the top pin to the A position, so it would open the door here, and then the second time that it is triggered, it would go to its B pin, which would take it to closing the door again. Then a flip-flop will just reset and go back to egg. So it's just alternating between two different options. Let's pull off of the execution pin after the print string here and type into the box flip-flop. Then you should be able to find the flip-flop node. When you do, press Enter. Here it is. You can see the A is already connected up. And if you could connect the B up to the second set relative rotation. You can see here, the first time the E is pushed, the flip-flop is going to go through the A pin, and the second time it's pushed, it's going to go through the B pin here. This is just going to alternate between an open and closed position. Let's try this out. Go and hit Compile and press Play. So when I go into the volume here, and I press E, it will open, and E again it will close. Open, close, open, close. Another useful thing to know is if you wanted to see the code actually firing off whilst playing the game, you could do this by making sure that you've got a separate window for the code. Then in this drop down here, that you have the specific instance selected. And then if you play the game, you can actually see the code firing off in the background here. So you can see it flipping between these two different options. You can do this with any blueprint, just as long as you've made sure to preview it in the section at the top. So now we have the basic opening and closing functionality. We are going to look at using a timeline instead of a flip-flop. This will enable us to make the opening and closing more smooth and animated. But this functionality for the time being works fine.",
