  "text": " Next, let's talk about working with the level sequence and some terminology to get yourself familiar with would be scene assemblies, which are assembled environments constructed from your DCC application. Then you've got performance takes, which are raw animated data, either that might be Mocap or animated in origin. Then you've got the master layout, which is the graduated take and assemblies used to block your character performances. Then you've got your shots, which are the master layouts combined with cameras to film the action. And then you've got a master sequence, which is the series of shots connected together, which represent a portion of the film or cinematic that you're creating. And then thinking about working with levels inside the editor. So the way I think about levels, you've got your persistent level at the top, which is the thing that houses all the information. But then you can create sub levels or streamed levels, which can have maybe locational specific content on there. Maybe you've got different environments that need different lighting scenarios and you can have a different level set up for each one of these elements. So if you have your persistent level, which is the universal item, then you may have your environment, which is your scene assembly. You might have sequencer lighting, which is any sequencer lighting rigs, sequencer cine, which are the cameras and items specific to that sequencer. There may be characters and blueprints and special effects that are related to the sequencer. And then you've got your post-processing, which is global post-process volume. So it might just give you a few ideas about how to set up and organize that information. If we think about some terminology that we might be hearing over the course of this video, but also as you continue your journey inside of Unreal Engine, when you think about static and skeletal meshes, as I mentioned before, a static mesh doesn't necessarily have to static in your scene because we can create movable objects in the scenes. However, static refers to the fact that you won't be manipulating this in any way. It's not a piece of cloth simulation. It may be a rock or a boulder. So this boulder might be rolling down the hill. Now it could be a static mesh, which is rolling down the hill, but it's not going to be a deform in any way. It's not going to be rigged for any purpose. It's just a static mesh. Whereas a skeletal mesh will always have some kind of bone data, even if it's just a single root bone, it will always have some kind of bone data. When we have actors, pawns and characters. So actor is always the highest level of content inside of Unreal Engine. An actor is actually essentially part of everything inside of Unreal Engine. So a light is an actor, a static mesh is an actor, a tree would be an actor. Everything inside of Unreal Engine is based around the concept of an actor. A pawn is something that houses potential information for controlling some form of character data. So a pawn could still be a vehicle. It could be a character that moves around, but a pawn will generally be able to handle input and it's something based on video game terminology there. Whereas characters then can be a child of that pawn. So a character might be someone that moves around the scene. And if you think about the hierarchy that we've just gone off there, everything in the world is an actor, which can then be created a child class of an actor to create a pawn and then maybe a child class of a pawn can be a character. When we think about the worlds and the maps and the levels, there's not a huge amount of difference inside of Unreal Engine when you create a new world to call it a map, to call it a level. This terminology can be interrelated. That being said, you may run into some edge cases where we create levels inside of Unreal Engine like we were creating our level sequences, but you can then create sub levels. Levels and maps generally can be interrelated. You may hear some things about world partition. So these are large open worlds that you might be using for these large grand cinematic sequences or large game productions. But essentially that terminology can be interrelated there. We have the level sequences, which we've gone into enough detail in the previous few slides. We've got control rig, which I briefly touched upon before, but we can essentially get the rig data of a humanoid character. It could be a car. It could be anything that you want to animate. You can create a control rig. If said actor, again using that word actor, has any kind of bone data, so it would have to be a skeletal mesh, going back to that first terminology that we learned. But as long as you have a skeletal mesh in the world that has some kind of skeleton set up, then you can use control rig to create your own animations inside of Unreal Engine, which is a really powerful tool. We have volumes, which can be used for a whole range of things. You may have lighting volumes where you want to focus certain lighting effects within this volume. You have post-processing volumes where inside a given volume, you can color grade your scene or add some post-process materials. You have blocking volumes, which will create pawns or characters in your map to not be able to go past a certain point because you've put a blocking volume there. Blowing volumes can be used in many, many different instances, but it'll be some kind of geometric data that you can put into your map. We also have blueprints, which is Unreal Engine's visual scripting system based on C++. So we can create basic blueprints. You can create complex blueprints as well, but in virtual production, you can create some really cool basic blueprints that you might want to add UI to your shots. Or you may want to toggle on some kind of lighting information or create a particle effect. And blueprints can be really powerful in this instance just to give you some more control over your scene. And then we also have source control integration inside of Unreal Engine. So if you're creating content and sharing it across multiple users and you have a larger production, even if you have a solo production, source control is very useful to commit to the cloud or the server, whatever content you're working on. Because if hard drive is corrupt or you lose information, it's still in the cloud. So source control is a really good way of keeping revisions of your data as well. And then lastly, thinking about some new terminology in terms of possessable and spawnable actors. So we can possess actors, we can possess cameras and characters, and we can move them around the scene once we possess them. So if we possess a character with some control input, you can actually move that character through the scene and around the scene. And if you so wanted to, you could use take recorder, which we referenced at the start of the video. You could use a take recorder to record your performance as a character and then play that back in a cinematic, which again has a lot of powerful functionality because the animation system is handling all of that information and then you can just record it and play it back without having to handkey everything of the performance. We also have spawnable actors, which you can spawn these actors at runtime. So say you want a camera to only live in this one shot and you don't want to bloat the entire sequence or level with loads of different camera actors, you can actually spawn them per shot if you'd like. Same with any other content such as lights, if you wanted to spawn some rim lighting for a certain cinematic sequence on a character, you could do that per shot instead of having these lights left around for the entire of the cinematic sequence, you know, in case a rim lighting one shot looks really good and then it affected another shot in some way, you could just spawn them in per shot and really take care of the fine control of that sequence. So hopefully that's a good amount of terminology to just get you familiar with the workflows inside of Unreal Engine. When thinking about translating the film into Unreal Engine, we'll look at some terminology. So film, which could be a feature or a shot is a collection of sequences, commonly a three act structure to create some form of narrative. Whereas inside of Unreal Engine, as we mentioned before, we think about this as a level sequence, which is still the master film. So it's a collection of all the organized nested level sequences creating an entire film. When you think about your acts, which is a basic structural division of film storytelling, which collects several sequences per act, you have the level sequences, which is the narrative structure organization of the nested sequence, which, you know, we're getting more granular and more granular as we go. A sequence in film, larger section of narrative film where an act is composed of several scenes. In Unreal, the level sequence is a collection of nested level sequences, placing nonlinear order on the shot track. When we have scenes, we have a section of sequence in a single location and time composed of several shots. Again, in Unreal, you can have a level sequence, which is a collection of sequences placed in linear order on the shots track. When we have shots in film, which is, you know, a single selected take of, you know, it can be any duration without interruption used in the scene creation. In Unreal Engine, we can have a single level sequence of varying duration and camera cuts used within that scene creation as well. So you can have multiple camera cuts within a single shot. When we think about takes in film, which is a single continuous performance of a varying duration in order to create the shot, we again can use level sequence and it's a duplicated level sequence used to create variations of the shots in level performance. So there's a very analogous kind of terminology going on where you can think of this sequencer as this way to house all of your cinematic content and you can then nest and create some level sequences of the higher level sequences. When we look at the tools and features of sequencer, thinking about a level sequence, we use that for cinematic sequences. So these level sequences can be nested together. So if we use the take system, you might have this film, which is the master level sequences, the parent sequence of everything that you're doing inside this scene. And then you can also have these level sequences, which are almost sub sequences inside of the master. So these are the individual sections that you want to use to edit the content together. And then you can put shots within side these sequences. So you can have shot one and shot two and multiple takes and you may have a variant of a few different takes happening. Then you can stitch that content together inside of sequencer. So essentially, sequencer is a powerful almost nesting tool where you can get as fine grain as going down to an individual key on a camera pan all the way to the high level kind of what is this film? I can see how long these shots are and where the music's coming in and out. And it's up to you how you can organize your content in this respect. When we've been referring to sequencer, we're talking about a nonlinear editing tool. So you can ground up shot create, you can pre-visualize scenes, you can create full films inside of sequencer. And we also use it in games for cinematic creation. So there's additional resources at the bottom of the page if you'd like to know more about sequencer. But essentially, you can think about it as a nonlinear editing tool where it houses all the content of your cinematic or your short film or a full film. It can house all the data inside there and you can see a bunch of buttons that we can click and we can change the frame rate of the scene. We can do camera fades and cuts and all this kind of thing, which we'll be digging into in a workshop in a little while. You can also add sub-sequences to each of the master level sequences. So if you click the track, you can add a sub-sequence here. These five sections are all sub-sequences to the shots. So you may have an animation track which goes across the sequence. You may have a VFX track which houses all your animations. You may have cameras, lighting, maybe you even have a meta soundtrack and all these different sub-sequences can house the relevant content. So as you scrub through, it'll still be loading all of this information in here. But it's just a cleaner way to work so that everything is hidden behind the sub-sequence. If you double click on each one of these sub-sequences, it exposes whatever's within there. Maybe there's camera cuts, maybe there's visual effects, whatever's going on. But it's just a much cleaner way to work, especially if you have a big persistent sequence with multiple shots in there because there'll be many different elements going on. When we're working with level sequences, you can use these sub-sequence tracks that can quickly organize the sequence or workflow. And then these tracks can then be nested. You think about it as like a tiered type of approach. And it just helps break it down between different departments. So within the VFX track, for example, you may then have multiple sub-sequences in there So you can just think about it as a consistently nesting type of approach where you start on the highest level, which is these are the master shots. This is exactly what we're doing. And then depending on the department or the teams working on these master shots, different people can be jumping in and out of the master workflow and work on these sub-sequences without breaking anyone else's workflow. So that's a really good kind of organizational structure to follow. Then it's also worth noting that working with level sequences, you can add all the actors, which are maybe a skeletal mesh, which is a character. Maybe you have a static mesh in there, maybe a boulder rolling down a hill. You can also add animations to these tracks. You can add keyframe transforms to move actors around the scene. You can also add fade tracks, which can fade colors, they can fade audio tracks. Again, just whatever you'd like to kind of add as a layer on top of this master track to add those more finishing touches.",
