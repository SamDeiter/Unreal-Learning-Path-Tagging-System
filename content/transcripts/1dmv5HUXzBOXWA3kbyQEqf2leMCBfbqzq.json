  "text": " Why FBX? FBX is a file format used for interoperability between various 3D applications. One potential problem when ingesting FBX data into Unreal Engine is scale discrepancy between the engine and the 3D program used to create your assets. If you're not careful, the assets you have modeled in your 3D application will have the wrong scale when brought into the engine. The first rule to remember is that Unreal Engine works in a centimeter unit system. This means that whenever you are in Unreal, one unit equals one centimeter. If your 3D application also works in that same unit system, then you're okay, but unfortunately that is not always the case. Here's a NASA Children 3ds Max, a simple raft. But a quick visit to the Units Setup dialog shows that the display units are set to feet and inches. The display units work only as visual aid, displaying units in the UI. You can set that to your preferences, such as centimeters or meters, but that's not enough. More importantly, the system units are the real concern. You'll see that in this case they are set to inches, which is the default in 3ds Max. So even if the model is built to scale, there is already a unit mismatch between Unreal Engine and the DCC application. To fix the problem, you can either do so at export time or later when you import the file into UE5. Let's export the scene as an FBX file. FBX export dialogs are roughly the same across DCC applications. The interface may look a little bit different, but the contents are generally the same. There are options for dealing with the geometry, animations, if the case applies, whether or not to include cameras and lights, and if you want to embed media such as its textures in the FBX file. Perhaps the more important section relates to units. Note how it defaults to an automatic setup, which basically picks up the project's units and leaves that unaltered, as is shown by the scale factor value of 1. This will cause problems in Unreal as this asset is designed in inches, whereas UE5 works in centimeters. Instead, you want to disable the automatic option and specify a unit that works for you. In this case, centimeters to match UE5. This will scale the project properly, in this case by a factor of 2.54. Let's test it out. There are already two saved FBX outputs of this raft, one in inches and the other in centimeters. If you haven't done so already, you need to download the zip file that's associated with this class. The link has been provided to you. Once it's downloaded, make sure you extract the zip file from the file. Make sure you extract the zip file to your local drive. Open the project FBX Ingest. Once it opens, create a new Basic Level. You're now ready to import the raft. Make sure the Content Browser displayed by pressing Ctrl-Space. In my case, I usually prefer it docked. Right-click in the Content Browser and create a new folder called Tutorial. This will be your working folder. Right-click again and create another folder called Boat or Raft. To import an FBX file, you have a couple of options. Either use the Import button in the Content Browser, and then browse to where the FBX file is, or simply open that folder in File Explorer. From the FBX folder under Assets, simply drag and drop the ZodiacInch.fbx file into the Content Browser folder you created. The FBX Import dialog appears. For now, leave all options to their default values. In fact, you can ensure the defaults are set by clicking the Reset to Defaults button and then click the Import button. You may get a warning or two. Simply dismiss this dialog. In the Content Browser, you can see how the FBX import process extracted the information contained in the FBX file. In fact, it extracted two mesh assets, the raft and the engine, two materials and three textures. These assets have a .uasset file extension on your disk and are now part of your project structure. To be technically correct, they were imported into the project but have not yet been saved to disk. You can tell by the asterisks shown on the thumbnails. To save them, you can select them in the Content Browser and press Ctrl-S. You can also click the Save All button on the Content Browser, which will not only save these assets but any others that haven't been saved to this project yet. Once assets are saved, then you can right-click the folder and use Show in Explorer to verify where exactly they are on your drive. Now let's verify the scale discrepancy. Simply drag the boat into the viewport. Press F to focus on it and maybe orbit around using Alt with left-click and drag. It certainly looks fine, much like it was in the DCC app, but it is in fact two and a half times smaller. One way to verify this is to compare it to another object that you know is set to scale, such as the mannequin in Third Person Blueprints. You can see that the raft is way too small. Next, import the raft saved in centimeters. Note that it imports the meshes but doesn't duplicate the materials and textures. Drag in the new raft and note that it is much better in size. I mentioned a few moments ago that you can also make scaling adjustments at import time, so if you forget to specify centimeters when you export the FBX file from your DCC app, or indeed if you have received the FBX file from a third-party source, you can make adjustments in the FBX dialog at import time. Delete the two raft actors and all the assets from the Content Browser. Reimport the Zodiac inches file, which we now know is in the wrong scale. In the FBX Import dialog, note the option to Convert Scene Units. Enable it and then import the file. Drag the raft into the level and note that it is now in the correct scale even though it was saved in inches. Drag the raft into the level and note that it is now in the correct scale even though it was saved in inches. As you construct a model in your favorite 3D program, it may be made of different parts. If you can, combine or merge these parts together before exporting to prevent unnecessary calculations. This combining or merging process can also be done at import time if you so choose. Here's another version of the raft, with 13 elements that in this case could and should be combined into one. If you forego doing so in your DCC app, then you have the option to do so when you import the FBX file into Unreal. You can test it out using the zodiacparts.fbx file, but before you click the Import button, expand the Advanced rollout and enable the Combine Meshes option. Note that you have a single mesh for the raft, but multiple material elements to preserve the material assignments you specified in your 3D program. This makes it convenient and easy to edit these materials inside the engine. Save your assets and your level before moving on.",
