00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
When it comes to working with others, Unreal takes a different approach to sharing data

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.820
and collaborating with teammates through an embedded source control system.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.359
In traditional workflows, the data pipeline is usually decentralized and frequently spread

4
00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.400
across multiple servers and departments, each having their own ways of handling data and

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.080
their unique files.

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.679
DCCs are usually dependent upon using a referencing system to pull data from a central server through

7
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.960
the network in order to work on your file.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.920
If your network is slow, or is being accessed by dozens or even hundreds of personnel, your

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.120
productivity can be negatively impacted.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.679
Comparatively, Unreal utilizes an optimized asset file known as the UAsset.

11
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.280
All imported data, whether it's animation, model files, textures, or other pieces of

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.679
information are converted into UAssets and stored within the Artist's local content

13
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.920
folder.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.000
Since the data is local to the Artist's machine, access to that data is substantially improved.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.560
So how do you get one teammate's UAsset files to everyone else on the project?

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.439
You utilize a central database program like Perforce, Subversion, Git, or Plastic to fetch

17
00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.079
or push data back and forth between each artist and a centralized depot.

18
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.960
The epic preferred standard is to use Perforce.

19
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.799
Perforce control prevents any two artists from working on the same file at the same

20
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.799
time, and version control is handled through atomic transactions that prevent data loss.

21
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.079
All alterations or new data is recorded and stored in a change list so that it can be

22
00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.759
accessed at any time to recover or revert data.

23
00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.159
All of this can be greatly simplified by using Epic's supplied tool known as Unreal

24
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.339
GameSync to help manage change lists and automate many of Perforce's functions.

25
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.659
In traditional pipelines, it's common to see models and animation files tracked by

26
00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.359
version numbers.

27
00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.340
This is recommended for the original files produced by your DCC, but the exported FBX

28
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.980
data that is brought into Unreal can remain a versionless Source Master.

29
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.780
Unreal is capable of monitoring if the file is updated and can automatically update for

30
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.939
any new exports if they're placed in a folder which is tracked by Unreal, or you can update

31
00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.340
it manually.

32
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.180
Your source control system and Perforce will track the changes made to any U asset in Unreal.

33
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.140
If you need to make alternate levels or level sequences, Unreal provides options like duplicating

34
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.659
the level or using the take system in Sequencer.

35
00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.500
Just be sure to keep your leads informed.

36
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.060
For dedicated shot tracking, Unreal integrates with Autodesk's Flow Production Tracking,

37
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.140
formerly ShotGrid, or some of you may know it as Shotgun.

38
00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.299
Edit plugins will need to be activated within Unreal, and a Flow subscription will need

39
00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.539
to be purchased.

40
00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:58.579
USD integration is also available in Unreal through a series of plugins.

41
00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.500
Once activated, these plugins will provide access to the USD Stage Actor and Stage Editor.

42
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.419
With Python support, this Pixar-based exchange format will help control selective loading

43
00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.780
and unloading of scenes with greater efficiency.
