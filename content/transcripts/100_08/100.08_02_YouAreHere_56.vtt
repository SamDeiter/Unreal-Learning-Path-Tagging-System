00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Traditionally, classic animation and visual effects production takes a waterfall approach

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.880
to creating content.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.919
Generally that means that each siloed department produces a series of products that are published

4
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.000
for the next department to use in order to create their content.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.400
This sets up a series of dependencies that limits a production speed based on the previous

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.719
department's output.

7
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:27.519
Think of it as an assembly line approach to creating content.

8
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.719
While these siloed departments are capable of working nonlinearly, it's difficult to

9
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.600
see the big picture without long waiting periods.

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.519
And what if a director wants major change?

11
00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.280
The number of dependencies increases further down the waterfall.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.719
The compounded time and effort required to make those changes becomes even more complex

13
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.679
when multiple software applications are needed to make the change.

14
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.120
The traditional pipeline usually contains these departments or silos.

15
00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.719
Product development and pre-visualization, production design and look development, rough

16
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.640
and final layout, performance capture and animation, effects and simulations, cinematic

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.000
lighting, rendering, and editorial.

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.599
These departments still exist in a real-time pipeline, but now we must improve how they

19
00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.679
work together, especially in a nonlinear workflow.

20
00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.599
In this slide, we can see a typical animation studio flow chart.

21
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:27.000
It shows how data moves from one silo and its departments to another.

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.239
While this is a simplification of everything that is going on, it's fairly universal to

23
00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.159
most pipelines.

24
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.959
So let's take a look at these one by one.

25
00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.879
Number one, story development and editorial.

26
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.679
Here the story department creates a series of storyboards and scene descriptions that

27
00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.599
feed the production design team.

28
00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:49.199
They'll also work with the editorial and sound departments to produce a story reel from said

29
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.480
storyboards and feed those sequences as reference to the layout team for blocking and shot production.

30
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.840
Number two, production design and asset construction.

31
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.000
The production designer and his or her team of art directors and concept artists will

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.360
implement designs for various sets, props, characters, and other items for the film which

33
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.599
are handed off to the modeling team where they are built, rigged, surfaced, and put

34
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.199
into a scene assembly.

35
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.439
Number three, blocking.

36
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.319
Commonly known as rough and final layout, these teams are concerned with character blocking,

37
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.679
shot and sequence construction, integrating animation, and placing the camera.

38
00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.199
Number four, performance.

39
00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:38.159
Here we obtain either classic key frame or mocap performance capture to animate our characters.

40
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.879
Once shots are completed, they're sent back to the final layout team for camera refinement.

41
00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.639
Number five, shot enhancement.

42
00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.679
This is a collection of multiple departments that produce necessary image enhancements to

43
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.639
bring the shot to life.

44
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.159
Number six, image output.

45
00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.000
Here lighting, rendering, and compositing are applied to shots to sweeten and finalize

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.679
their appearance.

47
00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.079
And number seven, final editorial.

48
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.599
This is where all rendered shots are assembled into a cut with finalized audio and sound

49
00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.599
effects.
