Thanks to its acquisition of 3Lateral, Epic has advanced its digital human initiative through the creation of MetaHumans.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The latest version of MetaHuman Creator is now embedded into Unreal Engine 5.6 for better functionality and project integration.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This allows for faster turnaround times and better ease of use.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Updates to LiveLink Face and MetaHuman Animator allow you to take advantage of your iOS device to stream data directly into Unreal with your phone in real time.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These tools, when combined with regular body motion capture devices, will allow users to animate humans on an unprecedented level.

6
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For traditional-based DCC animators working in Maya, Maya LiveLink is now available on the Autodesk website.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This tool will allow users to connect both applications together to take advantage of their Maya skill sets while simultaneously seeing animation and rendered content in Unreal.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As of the creation of this slide deck, Maya LiveLink currently supports Unreal Engine 5.5.4.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Another important tool for any animator or cinematographer's arsenal is Unreal ViewCam.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This tool leverages an iPhone or an iPad to transmit position and rotational data via LiveLink to drive the camera in real time.

11
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This capability allows the user to capture that handheld feel, or when paired with some sort of camera rig, the user can create more controlled shots.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
For those of you worried about not having an Apple product, ViewCam is now available for Android.

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's required that you use Unreal Engine 5.4 or later and have an Android device 7 or greater with the Unreal ViewCam app installed.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There are also a number of fantastic third-party companies that provide excellent motion capture, animation, and production tools for Unreal.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Many of their software products or plugins can be found on FAB.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If you're looking for mocap solutions or related tools, you have plenty of options to choose from.

17
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Thanks for watching.
