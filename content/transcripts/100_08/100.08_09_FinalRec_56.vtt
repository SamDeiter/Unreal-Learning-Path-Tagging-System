00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
When working an Unreal Engine, it's important to have the right hardware for the job.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.000
If it's your intent to animate within the engine and leverage tools like MetaHumans,

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.240
LiveLink, ControlRig, or other processor and GPU intensive tasks, Epic recommends an Intel

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.960
i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 5950X or better processor.

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.960
Gets 64GB of RAM and a solid state hard drive as well.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160
It's also important to choose a proper GPU.

7
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.359
By examining your role in production, you can make a solid choice of which car to buy.

8
00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:42.280
Modellers, shading artists, and animators can be served very well by an RTX 4080, 4090,

9
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.400
5070 Ti, 5080, or 5090 GPUs.

10
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.799
Whereas lighting artists, rendering specialists, and virtual production teams are required

11
00:00:51.799 --> 00:01:00.640
to use powerful GPUs with higher-end GPUs like the RTX Pro 5000 and 6000 Blackwell, RTX

12
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.400
6000 and 5000 Aida, or the RTX A6000 or A5000 Ampere-based cards.

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.479
When it comes to level management and organization, the best practices dictate placing all of

14
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.280
your commonly shared global actors into the persistent level while dividing up your action

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.819
into beats.

16
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.479
These beats can have their own dedicated level.

17
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.179
Once that's accomplished, sub-levels can help manage your scene assembly organization.

18
00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.899
Be careful not to have too many sub-levels because that can be difficult to manage.

19
00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.119
Level visibility can turn on and off sub-levels as the shot requires, and when rendering,

20
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.039
it's wise to change the streaming method for your sub-levels to Always Loaded.

21
00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.139
This will place the sub-level into active memory for faster access.

22
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
When planning your shots, consider optimizing your foreground, mid-ground, and background

23
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.859
elements to ease your rendering burden.

24
00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.040
Single-level sequences with a single camera cuts track can be great for setting up master

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.540
shots with multiple coverage cameras.

26
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.920
Plus it's great for simple editing.

27
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.879
For distinct shot-based workflows, it's recommended that you nest your level sequences together

28
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.599
with a shot track.

29
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.400
This will provide greater organization and accessibility for non-linear workflows and

30
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.000
makes your team work easier.

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.500
Try not to exceed more than three levels of nesting, and if you need alternates to your

32
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.180
shots, use the Take system to swap between level sequences.

33
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.020
Many people wonder what are the best practices for using actor persistence.

34
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.819
Choose spawnables for temporary background actors, custom shot-specific lighting, or

35
00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.580
one-off effects.

36
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.540
Make sure you're not parenting to the spawnable actor because those actors will disappear

37
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.239
after the level sequence ends.

38
00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.879
This will kill any parenting setup for those spawnable actors in the level.

39
00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.599
Attached tracks or constraints might be a better idea.

40
00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.639
Spawnables also have the advantage of reducing memory overhead for those actors who are not

41
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.639
in use.

42
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.759
As for possessibles, use these actors for fixed assets, scene environments, or characters

43
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.879
planned to be used throughout all shots.

44
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.460
Unlike spawnables, possessibles are not destroyed after the shot completes, so they're always

45
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.460
accessible.

46
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.780
We also have some resource links available for you.

47
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.979
These white papers, communities, and online documentation will help guide you through

48
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.939
potential questions you might have.

49
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.740
Okay, this concludes our lecture on transitioning from legacy production to Unreal Engine.

50
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.539
Thank you.
