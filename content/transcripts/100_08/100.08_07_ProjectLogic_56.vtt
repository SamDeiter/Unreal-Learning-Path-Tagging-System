00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now we're going to examine Unreal's project logic and its approach to shot production.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's not a coincidence that Unreal Engine's project structure bears a certain similarity to the structure of film production organization.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The Unreal Engine project is designed with progressive layers of complexity controlling scenes, actors, and various technical capabilities.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Like nested containers, each entity handles a specific function and communicates with each other to help you produce your final film.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This film analogy continues to integrate the way Unreal refers to its sequence terminology.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
While there are many new game-centric terms and tools that a user will have to learn,

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
sequencer can accommodate more common workflows like accessing specific scene assemblies,

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
supporting multiple performance takes, camera layouts, shot construction, and sequence organization.

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This brings us to sequencer, one of the central tool sets in Unreal for creating linear animated content.

10
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Sequencer is designed to function as a non-linear editing and assembly tool.

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Actors from the viewport or assets from the content browser are added into sequencer to create level sequence assemblies.

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The best way to think about a level sequence is to think of it as a virtual container that holds 3D animated footage that's spread across time.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Level sequences can be nested inside of one another through the use of a shot track to insert shots into longer sequences and beats of action.

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Combined with sequencer's take system, the user is capable of creating sophisticated nested hierarchies similar to the way films are organized.

15
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Films contain sequences, sequences contain shots, and shots can have various takes.

16
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Sequencer's UI is fairly simple. There is a toolbar where all of your primary tools and settings are located.

17
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There is also the track outliner that stores the items that you wish to animate.

18
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
There is the timeline where the shots, keyframes, and animation sequences in sub-scene tracks reside.

19
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And finally, there is a set of playback controls down in the left-hand corner.

20
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Sequencer can also access two very important sets of tools.

21
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The event manager used to trigger specific events and blueprints at specific points of time on the timeline, and the curve editor,

22
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
a traditional editor used to modify keyframes, their curves, and tangents.

23
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Another crucial tool is the level editor.

24
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Project organization is critical for organizing your environment through various sub-levels.

25
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The primary level that pairs specifically with your master level sequence contains the persistent level.

26
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
By default, anything added to the level will be placed here.

27
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
By double-clicking on any additional sub-levels, actors can be placed on that sub-level to be used for specific purposes.

28
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Depending upon your particular project, levels and sub-levels can be used to organize your environment, lighting, effects, or whatever you need.

29
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Within Sequencer, these levels can be turned on or off by using visibility tracks.

30
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The sub-scene track is a specific sequencer entity that allows you to layer level sequences within a level sequence for the sake of departmental organization.

31
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Please note, this feature is different from nesting level sequences together through the shot track, which is used to insert shots into a longer sequence.

32
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Sub-scene tracks are level sequences that handle very specific types of animation.

33
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
For example, a specific sub-scene track can be devoted to handling various effects that you wish to layer into your shot, like Niagara particles.

34
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Sub-scene tracks can be nested as many times as necessary to separate work between various departments or artists.

35
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Since they are level sequences, they are saved as separate files that can be checked out via source control for work without interfering with other artists working on your sequence.

36
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The next concept we're going to explore is actor persistence.

37
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In Unreal, actors are one of three types, possessibles, spawnables, or replacables.

38
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Possessible actors persist in a level indefinitely, and they can be controlled or shared by multiple level sequences.

39
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If you know you have specific actors or characters that will be used regularly, keeping them as possessible makes sense for ease of access and repetitious use.

40
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Spawnable actors only exist within the active level sequence. They're identified within Sequencer and the Outliner by a lightning bolt icon.

41
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This type of persistence is excellent for temporary actors who are needed for specific needs within the shot.

42
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Perhaps some extra lights, or a background actor who shows up just for the shot and then is no longer required.

43
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The idea of spawnables is appealing because it can keep your level and its environment free of unnecessary actors when they're not needed.

44
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The final form of persistence is replaceable actors. This blueprint-driven form of persistence is dictated by the binding lifetime track and allows you to swap out actors as needed.
