00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Alright, if you've downloaded the 100.8 zip file and did a right-click extract all, you'll get a folder that if you open it, you'll find an Unreal Project file, a source files folder, content folder, and config folder.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've got some extra folders in here, saved, intermediate, and derived data cache. These are generated when you launch the Unreal Project file, and they're used by Unreal to store various bits of technical and temporary data while the application is running.

3
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Whenever Unreal creates a zip file, it will remove these three folders for the sake of saving space. So double-click on the project file, and we'll go into Unreal.

4
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now that we're in Unreal, you'll find that we're inside of a third-person template. If you look around, you'll see that it looks pretty familiar. I'm sure you've seen it many times before.

5
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But what's different is that we have this generator in the center of the stage. This generator was built in a third-party DCC application, namely Maya.

6
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What we're going to do is take a look at the process in which Maya exports out an FBX file, and we take that FBX file and import it into Unreal.

7
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We'll also take a look at how all of the imported data correlates to what's saved on your hard drive.

8
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
When you open up this project, you're going to see that we have some folders inside of the content folder here.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The content browser and this hierarchy over here on the left reflects everything that's on your hard drive.

10
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
These four folders normally come with a template, third-person, splash, level prototyping, and characters.

11
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But this asset folder is something we've added. If you open this, you'll find that there is a generator folder, and inside of that, you'll see that there's a blueprint,

12
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which if you bring in, you'll see that we can add additional generators to the stage.

13
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But we also see that there is a texture folder, a mesh folder, and materials folder.

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These contain all of the various textures associated with the geometry, the meshes that make up this object, and this set of materials.

15
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, all of this, like I said, is reflected on the hard drive of your computer.

16
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So if you go to your file explorer and we go inside of the content folder, which is here, content folder, you'll find that there is an asset folder here.

17
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And if you double-click on this, there's the generator folder.

18
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And inside of that, here's the UAsset for the blueprint and the UAsset stored in the respective folders here.

19
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
All of these UAssets are basically extracted from the FBX file, converted into UAssets, and they're optimized for performance.

20
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They're Unreal's proprietary format.

21
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now we're going to take a look at where this generator came from.

22
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It was built in Maya.

23
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So if you go into your file explorer, source files folder, generator, you'll find a Maya scene directory here.

24
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Inside of scenes, you're going to find that there's a generator.ma file here and a generator.fbx file that it was exported from.

25
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Don't double-click on this yet.

26
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
What we want to do is we want to launch Maya and we want to do what's called setProject.

27
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
When you set project and point to the folder where that scene directory exists, generator, it will set the workplace root.

28
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So when you do a file open scene, it'll point specifically to the scene directory and show you where the generator.ma file is.

29
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It'll also let Maya know where all the source images and textures are.

30
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So let's take the generator and say open.

31
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Once this is open, you'll find that it looks pretty much like the generator that's in Unreal.

32
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It has all these various pieces of geometry associated with the generator.

33
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It also has inside of HyperShade all of these individual materials that are associated to the project.

34
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And Unreal allows you to export data multiple ways.

35
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You can do a file export all in which it exports all the contents within the scene.

36
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You can select specific objects and just do a export selection.

37
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Or you can do a send to Unreal, set a specific Unreal project and point to its content folder, and it will save all the associated data in there.

38
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm just going to do a traditional select all of the objects I want and do file export selection.

39
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This brings up a dialog box and it allows you to choose between what kind of file format you want to export.

40
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You've got a bunch of them that are in here, but what we want is fbx click export selection.

41
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And now you'll get another dialog in which you can set some options.

42
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're going to leave all these general options alone.

43
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But if you go under geometry, you want to make sure smoothing groups is turned on smooth mesh and referenced asset content.

44
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
No need to select triangulate here.

45
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Everything coming into the engine is automatically triangulated so you don't need to do it here in Maya.

46
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
We don't have any animation.

47
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We don't have any lights, but you do have textures.

48
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So you'll likely want to embed media to include those textures in the fbx file.

49
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Once we have that we select a name.

50
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So I'm going to call mine generator to an export.

51
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Once you're back in Unreal, I want you to right click in the content browser and create a new folder.

52
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We'll call this new folder gen2 for our second generator.

53
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We're going to look at some of the ways that you can import fbx files into Unreal.

54
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So the first and most direct way is to just simply go into your file explorer,

55
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
find the generator-2.fbx file that you exported out of Maya, and drop it into the gen2 folder.

56
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
This will come up with an import dialog box, but before you click on import, I want you to notice something.

57
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
If you scroll down to the bottom, you're going to get some extra information, and it will tell you this is a Maya 2025 file,

58
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and it's in a YUP world coordinate system.

59
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now if you remember, Unreal is a ZUP coordinate system.

60
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So the importer will automatically apply a 90 degree rotation so that it's properly oriented.

61
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So let's click import.

62
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Once everything is imported, you'll see that we have all of our materials.

63
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We have our static mesh components of the geometry, and we have our textures down here at the bottom.

64
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
If we were to grab all of our static meshes and drag them into the level, you'll see that we have our generator,

65
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and we can rotate this around and take a better look.

66
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You'll notice that all the individual component parts of the geometry are in the proper place,

67
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and if you look over here in the Outliner, everything is listed as a separate actor, but there's an issue here.

68
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
This model was built at 000, and all of the pivot points of the separate component parts are also down at the base.

69
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This might not be what you want.

70
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
If you want to have all of the pivots centered to the individual components, you're going to have to bring these into Unreal's modeling tools

71
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and re-center all of those pivots.

72
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That can be time-consuming.

73
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You might also notice that the geometry is almost fully white.

74
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There's a number of reasons for this.

75
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It could be that the FBX exported from the DCC might be trying to export shaders that are not compatible with Unreal's material system.

76
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
If that's the case, you're going to have to reassign those materials.

77
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But don't worry.

78
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The material IDs and the individual UVs for the object are still intact, and those textures will pop into place really easy.

79
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
If you want a further explanation of how this is done, we have some other classes that talk about this.

80
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Check those out if you're interested.

81
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now this import method does come with a few caveats.

82
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
As mentioned, everything is brought in as individual actors.

83
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
As long as all of these actors are selected, if you move the generator throughout the scene, everything is fine.

84
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But if you were to deselect and try to reselect, you're only going to grab one actor at a time.

85
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You'll either have to select all of the actors again in the Outliner, or you'll have to select them in the viewport.

86
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And that can be a little bit challenging.

87
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So we can address this in a couple of different ways.

88
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The first off is we can right-click inside of the Outliner and create a group.

89
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Once a group is created, I can move the generator throughout the scene, deselect and reselect with ease.

90
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And it will select all the individual actors here.

91
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The other option is to take all the selected components, go up to this icon, click, and say, convert selection to Blueprint class.

92
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I'll normally use Harvest Components, and I will call this Generator Blueprint.

93
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Once done, you'll be greeted with a viewport from the Blueprint, and everything looks great here.

94
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So we can close this window.

95
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And you'll find that you'll have a Generator Blueprint class item in your Content Browser.

96
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000
From here, I can just drag instances of this Blueprint into the level, and instead of getting all of those individual actors, you'll get just a Blueprint inside of the Outliner.

97
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And if you look at the Details panel for that, you'll also notice all of those individual components are maintained here in the Blueprint.

98
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Now, the method that we just used to import in FBXs was fairly quick and efficient, but has its issues.

99
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's a multi-step process. You have to create Blueprints separately.

100
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Your pivot points might not be in the exact place that you want them to be.

101
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So we're going to use a different tool called Import into Level.

102
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And to do that, we're going to have to get rid of these guys first.

103
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So we'll go ahead and delete them.

104
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And I'm going to get rid of all of this geometry as well.

105
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
For this next process, go up to File and choose Import into Level.

106
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Select the Generator 2.FBX and place it in an appropriate folder.

107
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This will bring up a new Import dialog box, and underneath the Scene tab, you're going to find the Root node.

108
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If you open this, it's going to show you the hierarchy as it's depicted in the FBX file and in Maya.

109
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
There are no groups here, but if there were, you could turn on the Create Content Folder hierarchy,

110
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and Unreal will create a series of folders in the Content Browser that reflect those groups and all of the objects inside of them.

111
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I also usually turn on Import as Dynamic.

112
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
This will set the mobility of the incoming actor to Dynamic so that you can move it around on the stage.

113
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
There's also hierarchy type. There are three. There's Create Level Actors.

114
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
That's where all the components will be listed as level actors in the Outliner.

115
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I don't want that. So we have Create One Actor with Components.

116
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
That sounds promising. And then there's Create One Blueprint Asset.

117
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This will be similar to the demonstration that we previously gave, where the Import into Level command will actually create the blueprint for you

118
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and place the individual objects into them.

119
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I also will usually turn on Bake Pivot in Vertex. This will bake the pivot as it's seen in Maya.

120
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So I'm going to go with Create One Actor with Components and Bake Pivot into Vertex.

121
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
The Static Mesh options here basically allow you to turn on and off different component parts of the geometry.

122
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I just usually leave this all on.

123
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You don't need to change anything over here on the right.

124
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
For Skeletal Meshes, we don't have any joints or any deforming geometry, so we can skip this.

125
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And for Materials, I want to make sure that all my Material IDs are turned on so that when I Import this, I can reassign Textures as needed.

126
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So let's Import.

127
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Upon Importing, you're going to see something similar.

128
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You're going to find your Materials, all your Static Meshes, and down at the bottom will be your Textures.

129
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
However, if you look over in the Outliner, you're going to find an Actor called Generator 2.

130
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
If you select it, you'll find our Generator hiding in the middle of the stage here.

131
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We can go ahead and pull this out.

132
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And we'll rotate it around.

133
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And you'll find that the Actor has all of its individual component parts in the right place.

134
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But if you go to the Details, you'll find that under the Actor are all the individual components, the Generator, Display, Modules, and so forth.

135
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
What's nice about this is that all the individual PIVots are now where they're supposed to be.

136
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So if you do need to make some modifications or changes, the PIVots will be where you expect them.

137
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Now, if you wanted to do something different, you could import this in as a Blueprint.

138
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And instead of having a Generator 2 Actor, you'd have a Blueprint down here in your Content folder that you could bring into the scene.

139
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Now, you'll also notice that there are a bunch of stars here.

140
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
This just means that all of these items have not yet been saved.

141
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So if I do a File, Save All, all of that will go away.

142
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And now all of these files are written to the hard drive.

143
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And if we go to our File Explorer, we can go in and find in the Content folder under Assets, a Gen2 folder, where all of those UAssets have now been written.

144
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Alright, let's continue.

145
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Let's go ahead and conduct a little practical demonstration.

146
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Say, for example, you want to change the appearance of the original Generator that's up on stage.

147
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Maybe you want to alter its geometry.

148
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
If we go back to the original Asset folder for this Generator, we want to change something within its Meshes.

149
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So we're going to look for what we want, and it would be, say, this Generator Static Mesh.

150
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000
If we go back into Maya and select the Generator and switch over to Face Mode, and we can grab some individual faces here,

151
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and pull them upward and say that's the change that we want to make.

152
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We're going to save everything again, just so that we have a full version.

153
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We do a File, Export Selection, and we'll do a Generator V3, and click Export Selection.

154
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And now we go back into Unreal.

155
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And we select this Generator and right-click and do a Import with New File.

156
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We can select the V3 version of the Generator and click Open.

157
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
What this will do now is it will rewrite the UAsset file with the new data and the appearance of the Generator has changed.

158
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Alright, this concludes this demonstration. Thanks again.
