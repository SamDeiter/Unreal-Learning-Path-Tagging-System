00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
So how does this compare against the classical pipeline?

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.300
Well, the story process is integrated and can be more easily modified throughout the

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.480
production allowing directors to leverage a more live-action shot construction process.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.559
Next, Sequencer becomes the production hub and can even act as the editorial system if

5
00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:20.640
desired.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.160
This creates a very director-centric solution where the revision process is more interactive

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.760
and the creative team can view final pixels directly in engine and in real time.

8
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.079
To help supplement Unreal's ability to work with other applications, Epic supplies Datasmith,

9
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.260
a series of conversion libraries to help translate and test late incoming CAD and spline-based

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.159
data into Unreal.

11
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.920
This is a major benefit for members of the art department who heavily rely on CAD-based

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.879
tools to construct concept art and precision models for physical set construction.

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.520
These actions are further enhanced by Python to help automate these translations.

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.200
This ability to aggregate data from multiple sources allows Unreal the ability to act as

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.700
your central hub of production.

16
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.520
If you have a need to work in another application, support is present to allow these applications

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.400
to do what they do best and bring that work into Unreal if needed.
