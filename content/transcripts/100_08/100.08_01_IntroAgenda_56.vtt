00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Hello everyone, and welcome to today's class on transitioning from legacy production to

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.960
Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.200
My name is Brian Poole, and I'll be your guide throughout this course.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.199
Here's a quick look at what we'll be covering today.

5
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.920
We'll start with you are here, and this will be a brief overview of a traditional production

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.039
workflow, exploring its pipeline and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.

7
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.039
Then we'll move on to where you need to be, and we'll define what makes an effective

8
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.359
next generation pipeline.

9
00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.920
You'll learn how Unreal Engine meets those needs, and then take a look at real world

10
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.079
productions who have successfully adopted Unreal into their studios.

11
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.439
As we move on to our production overview, we'll break down a typical real-time pipeline,

12
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:52.359
discuss its advantages and challenges, and look at the tools used for data management

13
00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.480
and team collaboration.

14
00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.519
Next, in exploring Unreal Engine, we'll dive deeper into Unreal's technical capabilities

15
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.039
by examining project structure and Unreal's animation support tools.

16
00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.000
And then finally, in final recommendations, we'll wrap up and I'll share some tips on

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.879
optimal hardware setups, best practices within Unreal, shot planning strategies, and asset

18
00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.519
organization techniques.

19
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.519
Alright, let's get started.
