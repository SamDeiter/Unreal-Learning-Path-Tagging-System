  "text": " I wanted to go over a few basic rules before you start exporting your FBXs. The main point to take away here is to make sure you use descriptive names for objects and materials. This keeps things really nice and organized. We'll cover this in multiple sections throughout the video tutorial here, but using the correct names for the correct objects in your scene will save you a lot of headaches. We like to reference Michael Ailes UE4 Style Guide. It's a really good example of naming conventions that we all use consistently. You also want to make sure your scene is well organized. Combine and attach meshes when you can and really pay attention to objects that have been scaled, especially in a non-uniform way. These can really cause issues when you're in editor later down the line. So reset those scales if you can to just 1, 1, 1 in the scale. Keep the scene as close to the origin of the world as possible. So your world zero in your DCC app, 0, 0, 0. As scenes move further and further away from 0, 0, the greater possibility of rounding errors happen. So just really trying to center your meshes into world zero will definitely help there. You want to revisit pivot points and ensure they're in the right place. Although we'll show you how to set pivot points later on, it's good to just have them straight out the box in the correct place if possible. So talking about units and scale, you want to mind your system units if you're planning to use FBX workflows. In Unreal Engine 5, we use centimeters for a unit of measurement. So one Unreal unit is one centimeter. And you just want to make sure your DCC app is using the same scaling system so you don't end up with any scaling issues when you get inside of engine. When you first import your FBX, we have some import dialog options that you can go through and select based on your requirements. The FBX file format does carry a lot of information. But sometimes you'll have generic options which you just scroll through and just tick each time. Maybe there might be certain configurations that you want to use. You can do things like generate collisions, convert meshes to nanite, convert units if you need to. We can also generate lightmaps using this process. A few of these things you will be doing in your DCC app anyway. But if you wanted something more generated, you can do that through the FBX import option. You can do things like combining meshes, controlling normals, converting materials, and many more options here. So when we talk about good naming conventions, what are we really discussing in the specifics about naming convention? The main thing here is to take a naming convention that works for you and your team. Using standard prefixes such as Michael Isler's style guide is a really good way to just keep consistent here. So aside from assets such as static meshes, materials, textures, make sure your DCC projects and scenes are well organized as we mentioned before. This will make content so much easier to organize. And especially when using prefixes at the start of your file names, it keeps everything organized when you get into Unreal Engine in the world outliner, which is the image that you can see on the right hand side there. So instead of generic names for your objects, just make sure you give everything the relevant name and then you understand exactly what you're seeing in engine when you get there. It's also useful to pay attention to your material IDs in your DCC app. Every object is going to have at least one material coming into Unreal Engine. And if you can organize those correctly in your DCC app before getting into Unreal, then it keeps things organized and each material element will follow the same as in your app. So material IDs help determine which polygon faces get the different textures applied to them. The more material IDs a mesh has, the more expensive it's going to be because Unreal has to do multiple passes of that object. When we're looking at pivot points, again, we can set pivot points inside of Unreal Engine, but Unreal does use the pivot point to begin with to determine where the object will be placed in the level. So if your pivot point is not in the center of your object or thereabouts around your It makes selecting the object quite hard and manipulating that inside of the engine. So make sure you set it to begin with correctly in your DCC app. And ideally for any given asset, the pivot point should be located at the origin. Sometimes when you're using things like modular building assets, for example, to create buildings, these may be located on the edges of meshes, for example, but for anything that doesn't need a specific grid snap to connect to another piece, like a set of Lego blocks, sorry, then you want to generally send to the pivot somewhere into the mesh. If the pivot is centered to the object, but the object is offset from the center of the world, the pivot point will relocate to zero zero inside of Unreal. When we're looking at triangle counts, try to keep triangle counts and check where you can. Don't model in small details if you're not going to need them. If you're not going to see things up close, I think this is just good modeling process in general, but checking that triangle count as you work on your models, it just makes the end process that much easier. So you can display a lot of triangles, millions of triangles in Unreal Engine 5 and we can use the Nanite system for certain things. There are certain things not currently supported with Nanite. If you plan your scenes around the polygon requirements, it makes that process much more So when we're talking about triangle counts as well, things called LODs, which is level of detail, can really help you out here. So we can control the detail, the mesh based on the distance that you're at. So if we look at the bottom left hand image here, we can see that the triangle count that we originally started with, the LOD zero, is the high poly mesh here. And as we get further away from this vehicle, you'll see the polygon simplifying and Unreal can help you with this so that it makes your scenes a little bit more optimized if you are further away from these objects. You know, as you're setting your LODs, you'll ensure that details can't be perceived at distance from the object. So hopefully when you're at that LOD three and you're say, 100 feet away from this vehicle, you're not going to notice all the small intricate bevels, for example. You want to use low quality versions of the static mesh to use at a distance. You want to generate LODs manually, or you can use the automatic generator inside of Unreal. So if you want to do the set the LODs in your DCC app, you can do that. Or Unreal will generate them, but you'll just have less control over that. So you've got to choose what process works best for you for any given object. If you choose from a list of presets, you can add presets to the base engine, any, which is found in your project folder that you create. And you can control the triangle decimation level inside here. You can control the distance, or more technically the screen percentage. So how much real estate this object takes up on the screen. You switch from one LOD to the next, and you can use LOD coloration mode, which we can see on the bottom right hand side here. So you'll see on the viewport, we just drop down from the lighting mode here and scroll down and you can find different view modes here to help you in your process of getting the most optimized scene. And then lastly, we talked about triangle count briefly before. And with Unreal Engine's new 9.8 system, we can handle millions of polygons in the scene without breaking a sweat. And this will only be supported on certain mesh types. So definitely check whether 9.8 is supported by these. But essentially, we can display millions of polygons in real time and only draw a handful of those on the screen at a given time. So you can enable 9.8 on the meshes in your content browser. So if you right click an asset and go to 9.8, you can enable 9.8 on a pair instance there. And when you import your FBX, you'll also be prompted with the option there. And you can also do it through the Static Mesh Editor. So if you've already imported your asset and you want to double click that asset, you can find the 9.8 properties there. And if you're struggling finding the 9.8 properties in the Static Mesh Editor, you can just type 9.8 into the details panel and it will give you all the options related to the 9.8.",
