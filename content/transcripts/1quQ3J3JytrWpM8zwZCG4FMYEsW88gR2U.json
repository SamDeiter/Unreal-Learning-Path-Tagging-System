  "text": " So far, the UI that we've looked at has been pretty boring and also pretty static. We can introduce a lot of dynamism to our UI extremely easily by taking advantage of UMG's in-built animation authoring tools. A widget animation is essentially a named property of a user widget. Unlike skeletal animations, which are a separate asset, a widget's animations are baked directly into the user widget and can be accessed as a property. As such, they're given unique names upon creation. Each animation is composed of several tracks mirroring the pipeline used in Sequencer or Matinee. Each track is typically linked to a widget and from there we can add additional subtracts under that first widget-based track. These subtracts are responsible for manipulating some property of its associated widget. So in this exact instance, we have an animation called Move. Inside the Move animation, we have tracks all linked to an image, a border and a spacer. Each of these subtracts have got their properties keyframed independently of each other, making quite complex animations possible with very simple modifications. Here we're manipulating the transform, pivots and opacities, but any value that we can change over time from a gameplay point of view can realistically be manipulated through a keyframe track. It's worth noting that the values of particular keyframes can't be changed at runtime. We'll see this more in depth with the live example at the end of the talk, but the long and short of it is, widget animations are for static changes. For example, we can't have an animation blend from one colour to another where that colour is chosen at runtime. We'll need to bake this animation into the widget during the authoring phase. So let's talk through creating a very simple animation using the star image from the previous slide. As you can see, it's nothing fancy. We're just going to be manipulating its transform property. However, the principles here can apply more universally to create a much more complex animation down the line. First things first, we need to come down to the animation section at the bottom of the UMG editor and hit the green animation button. This will create a new widget animation embedding it in this user widget. We'll name it move as an example. Next, with the animation that we want to work with selected, we'll select the widget we want to add a track for. In this case, we want to animate our star image. Once that's selected, we can hit the track button and select a track that handles the property we want to animate. In this instance, we'll just hit the transform button. From here, we can keyframe any properties within the transform that we might want to manipulate. For this example, we're adding a keyframe to its translation at zero, moving its X value by just over a thousand pixels at the one second mark, and then moving it back to zero a second later, creating the example on the opening slide. And that's it. We can now bind to this animation using the bind widget anim uPropertySpecifier that we'll be touching on in just a second, or play it out right in the Blueprint Graph. This animation is now a member of the user widget after all, so there's nothing stopping us from grabbing it in the Blueprint back end and simply calling play. Now all the visual stuff's out of the way, let's take a look at some of the code that drives it. We won't be covering the under the hood slate magic. We'll be touching on how we can leverage the existing toolset Unreal offers to author smart UI elements, and how we could integrate them with our gameplay systems on a code level.",
