00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
We have now reached the hands-on or the exercise portion of this tutorial.

2
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.759
And to do that, what we're going to be working with is a project called Box Hunter.

3
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.719
So Box Hunter is a game where the player is trying to collect boxes for points before

4
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.039
the time runs out.

5
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.760
And there's pickups that will give you more time, score, or jump ability.

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.640
There's also platforms that can be set up to move when the user steps on them or fall

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.199
or rotate.

8
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.800
And there's also logic that makes a full game loop.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560
So let's take a look at this now.

10
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.879
So if I come up here and press play, we can see here, here's my player.

11
00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.600
I have a timer so I can grab time.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.359
You can see the platform, that jump one will move, or I shouldn't say move, but it will

13
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.120
fall if I stay on it for too long.

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.439
The time one rotates.

15
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:51.480
So there's all types of different things that we can do here.

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.239
You can see, oh, it didn't make it.

17
00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.359
So I have something that happens.

18
00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.120
If I don't make it, I can go to the main menu here.

19
00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.239
I can also start, or if let's just jump off the platform again really quick, I can go

20
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.239
to quit.

21
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.599
There we go, quit.

22
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.159
And it will actually quit the game for me.

23
00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.359
So again, this makes an entire game loop.

24
00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.920
And this is going to serve as the example project that we build off of.

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.439
Because oftentimes when we're working on game projects, we don't start from absolutely nothing.

26
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.920
We have something to work with.

27
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.159
So we're working with actors that we pull into the world and we manipulate their properties.

28
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.159
So this is a really great example of that.

29
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.640
Now that we know a little bit more about the project we'll be working with, let's go ahead

30
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.759
and create a new basic level.

31
00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.799
And when we do that, we're going to want to also delete the static mesh actor that's added.

32
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.879
So let's pop over to the editor now.

33
00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:50.079
So what I'm going to do is come up here to file, new level, and then we're going to select

34
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.280
this basic right here and hit create.

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.640
Now as soon as it does that, we're going to take this bottom floor right here and press

36
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
delete to make sure that we've deleted that because we don't actually need that.

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.799
So the next thing we want to do here is press the save button up here.

38
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.680
And we're going to look for our levels folder.

39
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:19.719
And we're going to call this, let's say level underscore zero two.

40
00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.759
And then once that is done, what we're going to do next is we're going to come over to

41
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.560
our world settings here.

42
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.479
And we're going to make sure that our game mode is set to BP box.

43
00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:36.800
Now the reason that I want to do that is because if I was to play this now, notice I don't

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
have anything.

45
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800
I have no UI.

46
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.479
I don't even actually have a character.

47
00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.159
I'm just kind of floating around in the air.

48
00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.840
So what I'm going to do is come up here to my window and then we're going to come down

49
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.159
to world settings.

50
00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.919
Now with that window selected, it's going to come up here in my tab drawer system right

51
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.039
beside my details panel.

52
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.879
And then we're going to look for our game mode.

53
00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.240
And right here under game mode override, we're going to put this to BP box hunter game mode.

54
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
All right.

55
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.439
So just to recap, we came here to window world settings.

56
00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.320
The reason we did that is because this window wasn't open and we needed access to it.

57
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.240
Once we did that, we came to our game mode override and then we selected the BP box hunter

58
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.480
game mode as our game mode override.

59
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.080
And that is going to give us a player and a UI.

60
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.000
So now we're going to start adding actors to our project.

61
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.080
Before we can add them, we need to be able to find them first.

62
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.479
So you can find actors a number of different ways.

63
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:53.560
First off, from the quickly add to your project, from this dropdown, we can do things like

64
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.199
place basic actors like blueprints or things like that.

65
00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.939
We can place lights or basic shapes like a box or a cube.

66
00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.360
We can also find actors using the filters inside of our content browser or the very

67
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.240
powerful search functionality.

68
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.400
So we can search for something by a name or we can enable the filters and we can also

69
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.720
enable the filters and use the search feature.

70
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.960
Now no matter what we have searched for, we are going to need to add it to our project

71
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.560
and we add things one of two ways.

72
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.280
The first way is if we're using the quickly place, once we've searched for something in

73
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.120
this example right here, we've searched for light, we then just click on the object or

74
00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.120
I should say the actor that we want and it will be placed inside of the level viewport

75
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.759
somewhere in a relative location to our current camera.

76
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.040
When we are working with stuff in the content browser, once we find something that we want,

77
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.000
we simply drag and drop it right into the level.

78
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.160
Now once we have that actor placed, we're going to need to move it around and we can

79
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.199
do this a couple of different ways.

80
00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.680
We can use the gizmo to position it in the world or we can select what we want in the

81
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.479
outliner and then in the details panel, we can use the location, rotation and scale.

82
00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.800
So what we are going to do at this point is we are going to set up our level by making

83
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.719
sure that we have a player start, a platform, a depth volume and a wind volume.

84
00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.800
So let's pop over to the editor now.

85
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.000
So we're going to hit control space and oops control space here and from our content, I'm

86
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.600
going to come down to blueprints and I'm going to grab my blueprint platform right here.

87
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.199
I'm just going to drag that in and with that in here, I'm going to take its location and

88
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.839
just set it to zero, zero, zero and all this is going to ensure is that when I press play,

89
00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.439
the platform is right there ready for me to go.

90
00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:57.600
Alright, so what we're going to do next is we're going to grab this wind volume and then

91
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600
we're going to do the same thing.

92
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.800
We're going to take its location and set it to zero, zero, zero and then we're just going

93
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.560
to drag it over here like so.

94
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.480
I'm going to hit control space and then with the depth volume, something similar, I'm

95
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.639
going to go to zero, zero, zero but we're going to bring the depth volume down a little

96
00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.560
bit and then we're going to hit space bar twice.

97
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.160
We're just going to scale this out like so and then scale it out like so and this is

98
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.280
just going to ensure that if the player happens to fall, you know, if I come here and I'm,

99
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.080
whoops, I fall off of this, there's a way to trigger the restart.

100
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:50.240
Okay, so next what we're going to do is we're going to talk now a little bit about our actor

101
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
details.

102
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.920
So each actor has a details that contain its properties.

103
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.079
For us though on the platform, we have some different actor details like on our pickup

104
00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.920
types, we have a time, a score and a jump.

105
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.120
So the time will give us time to the timer score, will give us a score and jump will

106
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.920
increase or decrease the power of our jump.

107
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.319
Now we change those using this pickup type, we can click on the drop down menu and select

108
00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.160
none or select any one of these pickups.

109
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.200
There's also some things here for rotate, duration falling and enable platform movement.

110
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.120
So down at the bottom we have our score, jump and time amounts so we can adjust these to

111
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:42.600
adjust the various score, time and jump amounts that our awarded player runs into those.

112
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.120
For rotate when the user jumps on this, it's going to make it actually rotate the platform.

113
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.680
We'll talk about that in just a second but I want to get to falling.

114
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.600
So falling when enabled will make this platform fall in between about half a second and a

115
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.640
little bit under a second.

116
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.040
One thing to note, you cannot have a falling and rotate enabled at the same time, it will

117
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.400
rotate but it will not fall.

118
00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:13.639
What platform movement does, it actually works in conjunction with duration and platform

119
00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:18.079
movement when enabled allows the platform to move in between two points.

120
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:23.939
So we'll see here in just a second, we have these points 1 and point 2 and when we enable

121
00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:29.879
platform movement it's going to move between these two points based on the duration right

122
00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.879
here.

123
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:36.799
So let's go over to the editor now and what I'm going to do is I am going to grab this

124
00:08:37.439 --> 00:08:42.839
first blueprint, I'm going to make sure it just says none because that's the spawning

125
00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:43.839
one there.

126
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:48.599
Then I'm going to hold alt and drag out one, I'm going to just hold down, oops, didn't

127
00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:52.279
mean to do that, hold down alt again and drag out and add another one.

128
00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:59.199
So this one we're going to set to jump, this one we're going to set to score and then let's

129
00:08:59.199 --> 00:09:01.199
hold down alt and move like that.

130
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.920
We'll set this one to time and then I'm going to do this one more time, something like that,

131
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.560
maybe pull the wind volume up, there we go.

132
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:20.000
So what we have now is when I press play, I've got my score over here, I've got a jump

133
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.120
over here and then you can see I jumped really high and then I've got the time and then there

134
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.320
we go, I can win and things like that.

135
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.480
So what I'm going to do next is let's take a look at some of these platform properties.

136
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.240
So we're just going to grab this platform right here and I'm going to change this platform

137
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.120
type to none for the time being so we can have a look at it.

138
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.639
So let's take a look at what rotate does.

139
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:51.080
If I click rotate and press play and we jump onto this platform over here, you can see

140
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.480
the platform starts to rotate.

141
00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.399
Not anything too crazy, just a cool little thing that the player has to account for.

142
00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:08.800
And then if we do falling, what falling is going to do, oops, wrong one, let me just

143
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.200
play that again here, falling, it's this platform over here, is going to make the platform fall,

144
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:21.080
there we go and that can make a really great, you can have a bunch of these together so

145
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.360
that's a risk versus reward like there could be three or four of them and the player can

146
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.320
run across them and they have just enough time to get across them and before it falls

147
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.080
so it can be really fun.

148
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.360
And then we have this enable platform movement.

149
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.160
So to get the movement to work, we need to click on these little L1 so you can just click

150
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.600
on them and these represent the location.

151
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.920
So it's going to move between these.

152
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.560
If I press play here, we'll see here, see it's moving like that.

153
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.240
The other cool thing we can do with these two is we can also bring them up like that.

154
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:59.799
So it can go diagonally and then if I was to bring this down to say like one, bring

155
00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:08.440
it down to one, oh my number lock wasn't on, there we go, to one, there we go.

156
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:16.399
You see it goes really fast or if I was to set it to like 15, it would go very slow.

157
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:22.120
So with that said, what I want everybody to do, I'm going to pause this tutorial for now

158
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.720
and make a little course.

159
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.559
So we want to have something that has a, you know, a starch, a few little obstacles to

160
00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:34.559
the player to navigate around and when we come back, we will finish up with adding some

161
00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:41.439
backgrounds and some additional things to make this look super unique and finish up with

162
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:42.439
publishing.

163
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.720
I will see you back here once you have added a few more platforms.

164
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:54.280
All right, so now that you have added a few boxes or I should say mini boxes to simulate

165
00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.840
kind of a city or whatever futuristic landscape or environment you have envisioned, the next

166
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.480
thing that I want to talk about is adding some Niagara VFX admitters to simulate traffic

167
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.360
as this is going to be pretty common throughout any project workflow.

168
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.320
Now with our admitter, it's actually been set up so that when we placed it in the world

169
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.560
and we go over to the details panel, we're going to have some things like mesh scale,

170
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.080
the plane size, spawn count and velocity that we can adjust.

171
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.120
So what these do is the mesh scale scales the size of the box.

172
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.200
So it's going to give us a larger box on one of these axes, the X, Y or Z.

173
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.659
The plane size, this represents the size of the spawnable area that this is going to cover.

174
00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:42.740
So if we want to spawn over a larger area, we're going to make this a much bigger number.

175
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.500
If we want to spawn over a smaller area, we're going to make this a much smaller number.

176
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.500
Spawn count affects how many of these are spawned and then velocity controls how fast

177
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.980
this is going to move in a given axis.

178
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.980
And you'll see we can use velocity to kind of make these look like they're starting in

179
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.620
one direction, kind of drifting off to another.

180
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.740
So let's pop over to the editor now.

181
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.339
Take a look at how we would add these.

182
00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:07.939
So for this level here, what I'm going to do is maybe add some going across the back

183
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.940
here.

184
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.300
So I'm going to hit control space and we're going to come to our effects.

185
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.020
And right here we have our NS floating traffic.

186
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.780
So we're going to bring that in to, remember it's drag and drop.

187
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.660
And what I'm going to do now is I'm actually going to hit F to kind of focus in on this

188
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.660
because it was a little far away and kind of hard for me to see.

189
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.700
So it looks like it actually got placed kind of far away from me.

190
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.420
So I'm going to use my axes to kind of bring it in.

191
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.100
My play area is way over here.

192
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.660
So it actually got moved really far away from me.

193
00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.779
So I'm going to just try to bring that back in like so.

194
00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:39.779
There we go.

195
00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.779
Let's go.

196
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.059
So this is my play area here.

197
00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:44.299
So yeah, there we go.

198
00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:47.059
Maybe we have some traffic like that.

199
00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:53.179
Now it does, when this spawns in, it just spawns in.

200
00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:55.819
It has no fade in or anything like that.

201
00:13:55.819 --> 00:14:00.419
So you want to make sure that you're not showing necessarily the spawn in with these.

202
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:04.699
And the next thing that we're going to do is come down to its user parameters.

203
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.820
And let's like maybe adjust some of this.

204
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.820
So let's set that to like.

205
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.820
These are going to be some really big ones.

206
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.940
They should look really large.

207
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.340
I'm going to hit G here.

208
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.740
There we go.

209
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:28.500
We should have some really large looking flying bits of traffic there.

210
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.460
And then what we can do here is let's set our spawn count.

211
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.820
Maybe we set it to like 15.

212
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.140
So there's a bunch of them.

213
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.700
Okay 15 is maybe a little bit too much.

214
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.940
So we'll set that down to like maybe seven.

215
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.180
We might need to set this to like five.

216
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:53.180
Make them a little bit shorter.

217
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.380
Okay and then what we'll do is let's do this to like 3500 for their velocity or not their

218
00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.380
oops.

219
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.380
Let's reset that.

220
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:08.500
I meant to change their velocity here to 3500 or I think that needs to be at 3500.

221
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.299
And then one of the other cool things we can do with this is like let's set this to 150.

222
00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:16.500
So what's going to happen is they should end up looking like they're going up.

223
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.500
We might need to actually just increase this to like maybe.

224
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:31.419
Yeah there we go.

225
00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:37.299
So now what I want everybody to do is just do something similar.

226
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:40.580
Spend some time now and you can see here that we've added a couple of traffic effects

227
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.740
to this level.

228
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.419
So just spend some time now adjusting the traffic to get something that you like, something

229
00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:49.539
that looks kind of cool with your particular project.

230
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:55.059
And when you're done we will talk about working with the level lighting.

231
00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:59.259
Now that you've added some visual effects and background objects let's talk about working

232
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.139
with our level lighting.

233
00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:07.219
Now for this particular project the level lighting is fairly simple in its setup.

234
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:14.179
It makes use of a sky atmosphere, an exponential height fog, and a post processing volume as

235
00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:21.339
well as a directional light to simulate the sun and a skylight to help with the bounce

236
00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:24.339
light or the indirect light.

237
00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:28.819
All of these things are needed to work together in order to give you the best result.

238
00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:32.059
However that's not necessarily the way that you have to go about it.

239
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:38.299
In some instances such as if you were using say baked lighting and you had a light mass

240
00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:42.819
importance volume or you were using a skydome actor.

241
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:50.140
You might not be using say volumetric clouds or be relying more on post process or properties

242
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:57.100
in the skydome to represent things like the atmosphere or the cloud interaction.

243
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.660
The setup that we're using in this particular project is going to result in the most accurate

244
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.420
form of lighting but that's going to come at a direct cost of performance.

245
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.779
So while this is going to look really great and be easy to work with it is going to be

246
00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:14.819
expensive in terms of performance.

247
00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.099
Let's just pop over to the ender now and see what we have to work with.

248
00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:23.019
So easiest thing to do is hold down control alt and L. That's going to access a little

249
00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:27.059
lighting gizmo that you can then manipulate by moving the mouse around.

250
00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:33.259
And this is the method that I prefer working with when it comes to positioning my skylight,

251
00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:35.740
getting that really cool lighting angle that I want.

252
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.740
If we kind of look up while we do this we can see that as I start to position it towards

253
00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:46.980
the horizon I can get these really really great looking low cast light here.

254
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.019
And I'll just say that it is also going to be working with our shadows.

255
00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:56.380
Clouds in the background we can see the clouds picking up those subtle colors and even right

256
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.140
there the shadows look really really the shadows.

257
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.859
The clouds are looking as though they are shadowed and they're picking up those darks

258
00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:05.859
really really really well.

259
00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:10.619
So some of the other things that we can adjust in this system so I'm going to come all the

260
00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:12.859
way back up to the top here.

261
00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:16.019
We can go to our exponential height fog.

262
00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:19.459
So the exponential height fog is going to control well the fog.

263
00:18:19.459 --> 00:18:25.059
So if I was to maybe turn the density of this down you can see here I'm making the fog less

264
00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:26.059
dense.

265
00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:30.939
I can also adjust the height of it as well so I can bring it up and make things below

266
00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:34.859
a little bit harder to see or a little bit more included.

267
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:41.219
I also have a secondary fog here that I can do to add some more fog effects somewhere

268
00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:42.699
else.

269
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:47.619
I can enable my volumetric fog which is going to give me this just really great and interesting

270
00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:51.059
looking fog overlay on top of it.

271
00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:58.019
It's also going to give the fog a more 3D look and make it appear more that it looks

272
00:18:58.019 --> 00:18:59.819
like inside of nature.

273
00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:03.579
We also have our post processing so one thing to know about post processing there are a

274
00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:12.339
ton of settings in here but the most important one is going to be down here and it is called

275
00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.579
and I am just not seeing it somewhere.

276
00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:15.819
There we go.

277
00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:18.419
Right underneath post process volume settings.

278
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.859
Infinite extent unbound.

279
00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:26.460
So by enabling this what we do is if this is disabled which is the default it will this

280
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.460
post process volume will only work if the camera is inside of the post process volume.

281
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.019
That would mean we would have to scale the volume to fit this entire scene.

282
00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:40.259
If we enable this what that means is that now this post process volume will be applied

283
00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:45.259
to the scene no matter where we are in the scene and then by setting this this means

284
00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:48.740
that I can now come up here and basically set anything that I want.

285
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.420
I can come up here to my temperature and adjust this however which way that I want and so

286
00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.100
on and so forth.

287
00:19:57.099 --> 00:20:02.059
Our sky atmosphere one of the things we can do is we can adjust things like the ground

288
00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:06.939
radius or the atmosphere height to give us some different colors or a little bit more

289
00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:09.059
control.

290
00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:16.339
The only thing that I would really suggest you adjust in here is with the artistic direction

291
00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:21.259
unless you are setting something up for some different type of planet or atmosphere that

292
00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.939
is different than Earth.

293
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.779
If you are trying to adjust these properties up here like the atmosphere height or the

294
00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:34.340
atmosphere ray length or something like that you might not get the results that you want

295
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.940
if you are trying to adjust the color.

296
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.220
Better results are going to be down here in the art direction by changing like the luminance

297
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.700
factor the height fog can contribution and things like that.

298
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:51.460
The sky light is going to control again our bounce light so we could increase the intensity

299
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.860
on this to give us a little bit more detail in our we can see it here in the building

300
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.900
is in the background it is just going to make them a little more intense.

301
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.299
Then our volumetric cloud this has a couple of controls that are in the actor here so

302
00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:07.700
this is going to allow us to control like the layer height and things like that.

303
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.900
If we come over here to the material double click on it you can see here in the material

304
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.460
we have a whole bunch of other parameters that we can enable and adjust including things

305
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.380
like enabling storms and we have our cloud general layout and then the actual shape and

306
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.539
look of the cloud so a lot of parameters and things that we can adjust right here when

307
00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:32.100
it comes with working with lights because again when we are working with lights especially

308
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.299
in an outdoor environment it is more than just working with a directional light it is

309
00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:41.460
working with all of these different things in conjunction together to give us the final

310
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.460
image.

311
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:51.460
Alright so before we finish up the last thing that we need to do is modify some of our blueprint

312
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.740
code to point to our level that we want to load because right now if we were to play

313
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.900
this or publish it it is going to use the default level so this is pretty simple to

314
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.940
do what we are going to do is over here inside of the editor I am going to hit control space

315
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.220
and then I am going to look for our UI and we are going to look for our UB for widget

316
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.259
blueprint main menu we are just going to double click on that to open it up.

Once that is open we are going to come over here to the graph and the graph is pretty

318
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.700
simple we have a start and a quit so the start if we zoom in on it we have on start and then

319
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.660
open level and we have this by object reference so right here we are just going to click the

320
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.940
level that we want to open which is going to be level 2 or whatever your level name

321
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.339
is once you compile and save this that is the level that will be open so this is the
