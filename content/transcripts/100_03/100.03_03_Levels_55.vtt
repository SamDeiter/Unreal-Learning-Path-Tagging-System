00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540
Now, before we jump into building levels, let's quickly talk about levels and what they are

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.560
as understanding this is very important.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.039
So an Unreal Engine project is not made up of a single file, but rather a collection

4
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:25.539
of source code, content assets, plugins, configuration files, and other support files, right?

5
00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.699
So one Unreal project is actually a collection of a bunch of different things.

6
00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:38.539
Now in order to see what you interact with, we need a way to link all of these various

7
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.000
things together and that's where levels come in.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.179
Levels allow us to add or spawn actors.

9
00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:59.340
And these actors are what are used to help bring life to our creations.

10
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340
Now when you are dealing with levels, there is this concept of a sub-level that would

11
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.700
be a level inside of a level.

12
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.420
And while this is possible, the main thing to take away from this is that no matter what

13
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.379
you are trying to display, you're always going to need some type of level in order to display

14
00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.259
that information.

15
00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.079
Now Unreal has a number of tools that make it easy when you create a new level.

16
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.579
So to make a new level, all we have to do is go to File, New Level, and this will invoke

17
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.459
the New Level Creation Wizard.

18
00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.979
Then from there we can select any of the templates, Open World, Empty Open World, Basic, or Empty

19
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.700
Level, press Create, and we will have a new level created.
