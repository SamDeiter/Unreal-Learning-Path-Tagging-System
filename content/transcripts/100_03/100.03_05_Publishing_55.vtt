00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.439
Alright, now that we have added some gameplay, we have added background objects, adjusted

2
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:13.960
our visual effects, our lighting, and set up our project to make sure it loads the level

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.160
we created. We're now going to take a look at publishing our project for Windows. But

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.920
before you do that, there is a few things that we need to do. First off, if you haven't

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.440
done so already, you'll need to install Visual Studio Community in order to continue the

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.679
publishing process. This is because we need a couple of updated SDKs and .NET updates

7
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.640
in order to get the required files to successfully create a Windows executable. So again, just

8
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.439
look for Visual Studio Community in your favorite web browser and then download it, install

9
00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:55.240
it. Once you've installed it, make sure you restart your computer, then launch your Unreal

10
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.000
Engine project and go up to platforms, Windows and package project. Once you've done that,

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.879
it is going to take a little time depending on the size of your project. It could take

12
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.799
a few minutes, it could take a few hours, really depends on how much content is going

13
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.840
to be packaged. But once it is done, you're going to get something like this. You are

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.560
going to get a executable, an RKIS is going to be boxhunter.exe and when somebody launches

15
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.560
that they're going to be able to play your game from the beginning, the middle to the

16
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.920
end. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and check this out now. So again, to

17
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.960
publish this, we're going to go up to platforms, we're going to go to Windows and package.

18
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.879
I'm going to come up to here, I'm just going to hit delete because I've packaged this before

19
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:42.280
but I have my desktop and then you'll need to make a new folder and there's our boxhunter.

20
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.040
So we're just going to say select folder and now it's starting to package and if we do

21
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.680
our show log here, we're going to see the log of our package. So we'll be back right

22
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.840
in just a few minutes once this is finished.
