00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
So before we go any further, I want to have a real quick recap of Unreal Engine 5 just

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.960
to interface, movement, and what actors are just so that we're all familiar with different

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.439
terms and things like that.

4
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.960
So let's go ahead and just take a look at the user interface.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080
So across the top here, we have our file menu.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.400
So this is going to be the same file menu that we see throughout the editor.

7
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.879
We're going to access things like editing new levels or creating new levels for us to

8
00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.399
edit from up there.

9
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:43.679
We're going to look at things like documentation reference, project settings, editor settings,

10
00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:44.879
and things like that.

11
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.640
Now two is going to be our main toolbar.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.960
This is we're going to be creating new types of content or actors to add to our levels.

13
00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.200
We can also adjust our tool set to further refine the types of tools that we're using

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.960
here in the selection mode.

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.640
We have the ability to play and then adjust for our platform that we want to quickly launch

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.480
on as well as some settings to deal with rendering.

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.760
So three is going to be our level of viewport.

18
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.359
This is where we're going to spend most of our time editing things and adding things

19
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.079
and moving them around as well as adjusting our lighting and things like that.

20
00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.799
So for here, this is our tabbed drawer system.

21
00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.719
These menu options can be moved around and things like that.

22
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.840
The Outliner allows us to look at things that are placed in the level and the Details panel

23
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.640
allows us to get more information about anything that we click on.

24
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.560
So the Details panel is context sensitive, meaning that when we click on it, different

25
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.719
things are going to show us different items in the Details panel.

26
00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.719
Five is our content drawer.

27
00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.480
This is where we can access the content browser.

28
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.560
And then six, this is going to be where we access our output log or enter any console

29
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
commands.

30
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240
And this is particularly important if we're doing any type of a debug information or anything

31
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.240
like that.

32
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.000
So next on our list, we have viewport navigation.

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.420
So remember, you can view navigate the viewport in Unreal two different ways.

34
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:22.299
You can use the WASND key along with the QE to move the camera up and down with Q and

35
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.579
E or holding down the right mouse button.

36
00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.779
You can use WASND to move the camera forward, backwards, left and right.

37
00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:39.619
You can also navigate through Unreal using just the mouse by holding down the left mouse

38
00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.619
button.

39
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.819
You can move the mouse forward, backwards, and turn left and right.

40
00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.180
But holding down the right mouse button, you can drag the static POV around the scene.

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.739
And by holding down the middle mouse button, you could actually track the camera.

42
00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.939
A couple of other things that are important, F to focus in on an object makes it extremely

43
00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:58.939
useful.

44
00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.259
Should you lose that object or you maybe get thrown out of the scene really far away and

45
00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:09.340
you need to get your way back in, F can be a great way to focus in on stuff.

46
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.620
You can also use ALT and the left mouse button to drag and orbit or tumble around the object.

47
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.620
And then ALT right mouse button will drag and dolly the camera further away from you.

48
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.219
Alright, so working with actors.

49
00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.740
So actors again are objects that can be placed or spawned into a level.

50
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.500
And we're going to be working with a bunch of different actors.

51
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.020
So it's important to know what they are.

52
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.300
And here's actually just a collection of actors and basically the stuff that we are

53
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.419
going to be working with.

54
00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.460
So that's it.

55
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.740
That wraps up our Unreal Engine recap.

56
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.539
We will see you in our next section.
