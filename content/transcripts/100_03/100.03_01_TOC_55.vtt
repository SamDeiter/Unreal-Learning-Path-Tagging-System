Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with Epic Games.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the following video tutorial series, we're going to be taking a look at creating your first Unreal Engine project for games.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And what that is going to entail is we're first going to take a look at Unreal Engine 5, just a quick recap,

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
by looking at the user interface, viewport navigation, and working with actors,

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
just to refresh us on how these systems work as we're going to be using them to create some new levels.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Which brings us to the next part of this tutorial series, levels.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We're then going to talk about level concepts and how we create levels,

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
as levels are a key component of any Unreal Engine 5 project.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then we're going to move on to the exercise portion or the hands-on portion of this.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is going to entail us first taking a look at the project we're going to be working with.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're then going to look at how we set up an initial level.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then we'll take a look and add some actors to that level.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We'll then add some visual effects as well as some background props to really bring the level to life.

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then once we're done with all of that, we'll go over how we can publish this level to windows,

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
so that when we're done we have an executable that can be given to anyone that can play our project.

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We've got a lot to cover, so let's go ahead and get started with our Unreal Engine 5 recap.
