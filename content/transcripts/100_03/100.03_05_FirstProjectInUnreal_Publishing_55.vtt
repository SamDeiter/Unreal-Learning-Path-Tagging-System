00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
All right, now that we have added some gameplay,

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.720
we have added background objects,

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.000
adjusted our visual effects,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.599
our lighting, and set up our project to make sure it loads the level we created.

5
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.580
We're now going to take a look at publishing our project for Windows.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.519
But before you do that,

7
00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.920
there is a few things that we need to do.

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.480
First off, if you haven't done so already,

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
you'll need to install Visual Studio Community in

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.920
order to continue the publishing process.

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.480
This is because we need a couple of updated SDKs and

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.320
.NETs updates in order to get

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.960
the required files to successfully create a Windows executable.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.719
So again, just look for Visual Studio Community in your favorite web browser,

15
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.280
and then download it, install it.

16
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.880
Once you've installed it, make sure you restart your computer,

17
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.760
then launch your Unreal Engine project,

18
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:00.679
and go up to platforms, Windows, and package project.

19
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.839
Once you've done that, it is going to take a little time,

20
00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.200
depending on the size of your project.

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.480
It could take a few minutes,

22
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.679
it could take a few hours,

23
00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.359
really depends on how much content is going to be packaged.

24
00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.519
But once it is done,

25
00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.159
you're going to get something like this.

26
00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.000
You are going to get a executable,

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
an RK is going to be boxhunter.exe,

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.680
and when somebody launches that,

29
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.159
they're going to be able to play your game from the beginning,

30
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.439
the middle, to the end.

31
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.879
So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and check this out now.

32
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.239
So again, to publish this, we're going to go up to platforms,

33
00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.039
we're going to go to Windows and package.

34
00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.239
I'm going to come up to here,

35
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.599
I'm just going to hit delete because I've packages before,

36
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.640
but I have my desktop and then you'll need to make a new folder,

37
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.879
and there's our boxhunter,

38
00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.519
so we're just going to say select folder,

39
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.439
and now it's starting to package.

40
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.640
And if we do our show log here,

41
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.560
we're going to see the log of our package.

42
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.519
So we'll be back right in just a few minutes once this is finished.

43
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.599
All right, now our project has finished packaging,

44
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.759
so let's go ahead and take a look at the ending result here.

45
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.920
So we're going to open up my explorer here,

46
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.879
and we're just going to look for our boxhunter.

47
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.120
Going to go to Windows,

48
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.400
and there we go, look, we have our boxhunter, our engine, and our EXE.

49
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.520
So there we go, we're going to double click on that,

50
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.400
and let me just bring this over to this other monitor over here

51
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.879
because it opened up on my secondary monitor.

52
00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.560
So let me just bring this over.

53
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.879
There we go, there's our boxhunter, and when I hit start, there we go.

54
00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.159
We have our project here,

55
00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.359
and I have mine with the default level,

56
00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.639
but you should now have the level that you created,

57
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.919
and you should be able to play it just like I'm doing now.

58
00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.759
And when we do this, we should be able to go to the main menu,

59
00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.719
we can start, or let's just do this one more time,

60
00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.759
and we can come here and we can actually quit,

61
00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.400
which will end the project.

62
00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.480
So with that said,

63
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.520
that is actually going to wrap everything up.

64
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.680
So in today's talk,

65
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.120
we started off with looking at an Unreal Engine 5 recap,

66
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.840
going over the user interface,

67
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920
viewport navigation, and working with actors.

68
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.879
We then moved on to talking about levels,

69
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.759
we talked about level concepts and how we create levels,

70
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:19.200
and then we dove into our exercise with our project introduction,

71
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.239
then we set up our levels, we worked with actors,

72
00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.119
we added visual effects and background props,

73
00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.799
and then finally we published four windows.

74
00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.639
So that is all that I have for you in this tutorial series.

75
00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.039
I hope you enjoyed watching it as much as I enjoyed presenting to you,

76
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.599
and I will see you next time.
