  "text": " Now that we understand a little bit about how the material we are creating is going to function, let's go ahead and start creating that material. Now to do this, we're first going to have to make a brand new material inside of our content browser. And then when we open that material up, we're going to add two texture samples, and we're going to convert these to texture parameters, one called BC dirt and the other called BC grass. And the reason that we're creating these as texture parameters is to make it easier for us to adjust the landscapes textures once the landscape has been created and turned into an instance. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now. With the editor open, I'm going to hit control space, and I'm just going to come here, and I'm going to right click, go to my material, and just do mat underscore landscape. And then we're going to double click on this to open it up. Now the texture samples that we use are not really that important because remember, we're going to make these into parameters. So let's go ahead and just pull in two textures. Now we can do this a number of different ways. The way that I like to do it is hold down the T key on the keyboard and click, and that's going to add a texture sample. Now, unfortunately, this just adds this. We do need to add some type of texture inside of here. The other way that we can do this is if we hit control space and we come over here to say like surfaces, I'm going to go up here to let my dried grass and I just grab this texture and pull it in like so. It's also going to pull that texture in. So I'm going to actually just delete this one and we're going to right click on this for the time being. I'm going to go convert to parameter. We're going to call this one BC for base color underscore grass. And then I'm going to hit control space. I'm going to go to we'll go to this rocky ground right here and we'll grab this texture sampler. We'll pull that in and then we're going to right click and go convert to parameter BC underscore dirt. All right. So next what we're going to do is we are going to create our slope setup. Now, this involves the following nodes. We have a slope angle. The slope angle allows us to control the angle at which this interaction is going to happen. So generally, we want this to happen from the top to the bottom. But there could be an instance where maybe we want some action from the left side or the right side. So we're going to add this in there just in case we want to mess around with these values a little bit and make some adjustments. We then have the slope fall off power and the slope contrast. Now, what these two nodes allow us to do is control the way our two textures are going to be mixed. The slope fall off power is going to control kind of the fall off between texture A and texture B. And the contrast is going to increase or decrease the sharpness of that. Finally, all of these nodes are going to be plugged into our slope mask, which is a material function that allows us to define the slope part A and the slope part B. So let's go ahead and set this up inside of our material. So we're going to pop over here to the material editor. I'm just going to pull back here a little bit. And we are going to first off, we're going to hold down the four key on the keyboard and left click. And that's going to add a four channel parameter node, which we can then right click on and convert to a parameter. And we're going to call this slope. Slope angle. And then the default value here is going to be one in the blue. All right. So next, what we need to do is we need to add some constant parameter nodes. So I'm going to hold down the one key and click once and that's going to add a constant parameter. So again, holding down the one key on the keyboard and then left clicking will add that constant parameter. Then we're going to click on this, right click on it and convert to a parameter. And we are going to call this first one. This should be slope fall off power. And we're going to give it a default value of one. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit control C and then control V, oops, control C control V. That's going to duplicate this node for us. And we're going to call this new node that we duplicated slope contrast. And we're going to leave its value set to 1.0. Next, what we need to do is we need to add our slope mask. Now, unfortunately, we can't add the slope mask through a keyboard shortcut. We do need to click inside of here and then search for our slope. And right here we have a slope mask. It's just showing up in two locations. We can select either or someone to select this top one right here. So there we go. There's our slope mask. And what we're going to do next is we are going to connect everything together like this. So we're going to go ahead and set up our BC dirt and our BC grass. And then we're going to use a LERP and a LERP stands for linear interpolate. And LERPs are really a fantastic thing inside of your materials as they allow you to mix two inputs like our BC dirt and our BC grass by an alpha. And this is really where things start to happen. So with this setup on screen, which we're going to make in just a second, this will already allow us to have some type of interaction with our landscape. So let's go ahead and set this up now. So back over in the editor, we are going to first we're going to add our LERP parameter. So to add a LERP, we can hold the L key down on the keyboard and press. And that's going to add our LERP. So we're going to connect the RGB or the RGB output of our BC grass into the A input and then the RGB of our BC dirt into the B. And now what we need to do is just set this up. Now, this is actually pretty easy to set up. All we need to do is take the output of our slope angle and plug that into here. And then I want to move these two parameters down like slow. So and we have our slope fall off power, which is going to be right up here. And then this cheap contrast is going to go in our slope contrast. Once all of that has been completed, all we need to do now is take this result and plug it right here into our alpha and then take the output of our alpha and plug it into our base color. Now that we have that done, we can actually see this kind of happening in action. We can see there is our dirt and then there is our grass. So let's go ahead and apply and save this so we can save our work. Now, I'm going to move some things around here because the next thing that I want to talk about is the named reroute. Now, as this material starts to grow in size, it is going to become very difficult to read through the various wires that connect everything. So we can add this new named reroute declaration node. And this is really cool because what this allows us to do is it allows us to put blocks of shader code off to the side. And then instead of having to make a wire connection across the entire graph, we can pull these little named reroute declaration nodes out, plug them into their respective inputs, and that will make that connection with us without us having to really worry too much about the wire interaction. So let's go ahead and pull one of these out by coming over here to the editor. And we're going to right click inside of here and look for a named and right there, add a named reroute declaration node. So we're going to put this in here and we're going to call this new one slope. And let's take that. So slope. There we go. And then what we're going to do is I'm actually going to hold down alt and click right here, which is going to break our connection, and we're going to move this little bit of shader logic just over here. And then for these named reroutes to work, what we do is we take this result and we just plug it in right there like that. Then we come over here and if we just click inside of the shader graph, we look for this named reroutes, we grab the slope, and then we plug this in like so. So look, we have the exact same behavior that we had before. And if I just undo this, we can see here there is a little bit, but it's kind of mixing it all together. So it's just showing kind of both of them. If we plug this back in, you can see here it's got the rock and then the grass. So let's go ahead and apply and save. And this concept, and here's again an example of what we did. If you need to catch up, we took our slope mask, we took our slope angle, we put that into our falloff power and our cheap contrast, and then we added our named declaration for slope. And then inside of our lerp, we just looked for our named reroute and we input that into our alpha. Now, this is really, really powerful because we're going to be doing this for a lot of other things that we need to do. For example, next up, we are going to add some tiling. But in order to do this for all of the different things that we're going to have in this, we are going to make our tiling code off to the side like with our slope contrast, and then we're going to add a named reroute. So let's go ahead and set this up now. All right. So first off, we're going to come over here and we're going to add a texture coordinate. So there's our texture coordinate. Then I'm going to hold down the one key and click, and that's going to add a constant, which we're going to right click and convert to a parameter, which we are going to call grass underscore tile. We're going to give this a default value of one. Then what we're going to do is I'm going to hold down the M key on the keyboard and click to add a multiply. And then we're going to connect like so. Now, once we have these two connected, we are going to look for a add a named reroute declaration node. And we are going to call this grass underscore tile. And it looks like it didn't take the name again. And we're going to plug our output of our multiply into our grass tile. So let's just recap and give everybody a chance to catch up. Here is what we've been doing. So there is our grass tile with our texture court. That's multiply. Remember, we got that multiply by pressing M on the keyboard and left clicking. And then we added our named reroute declaration, which we called grass tile. Now, the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to duplicate this work, but we are going to call this new one dirt tile. And then once we've created that dirt tile, we're going to plug in our grass tile to match what we see on the screen in front of us. Let's pop over to the editor now and go ahead and take care of that. So really easily we can come up here and we can right click and just duplicate this and move it up. And now we need to just change this from grass to dirt. So we're going to go D-I-R-T and then we're going to change this one to D-I-R-T. Oops, looks like it got rid of everything. All right. So dirt tile, grass tile. And then we just need to come over here to our BC grass and our BC dirt and input things respectively. So we're going to go named reroute dirt tile and named reroute grass tile. So let's take our grass tile. There we go. And then our dirt tile. There we go. All right. So let's go ahead and apply and save. All right. So next what we need to do is we need to set up this exact same logic, but we need to do it for our roughness and our normal maps. So the easiest thing for us to do is to actually duplicate what we have. And really all we have to change is just the names of the 2D textures parameters. So let's go ahead and do that now. So I'm going to pop back over here and you're going to see this is going to be really, really simple and fast. We're just going to take all of this code and I'm going to hit control C and then control V to paste that in there. And then instead of BC grass, this is going to be our roughness. So we're going to call this our grass and then we're going to call this one our dirt. All right. Now we do need to change these texture sampler. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to press this browse to asset and we're going to grab this dried grass 4K ORDP. This is basically and I'll open this up so we can see it really quick. So what this is, this is a mass texture that's storing different information in the red. The green and the blue channels of our map here. What we're interested in is the G and the B channels. So the roughness is going to be inside of the G channel and the B channel is going to contain the displacement. That's what these letters after the term means. So the O is the occlusion or the ambient occlusion, R is the roughness and D is the displacement. So once we have this grass texture in here, all we're going to do is we're going to come here to our individual channel. We're going to grab the G right here and plug that in. And then the same for our dirt. We're going to find out where its mask is, grab its mask, replace and then pull in from the G channel right there. Then we're going to plug this in to our roughness. All right. So next, we need to just take all of this and then hit control C, control V. And we're going to change this now to N underscore grass. And then N underscore dirt. And then we again, we're going to look for this inside of the content browser, select the normal map version of it to make sure that we have a normal map inside of here. And like so. And then once we've done that, we are going to connect this to the normal input. And one other thing, if yours looks like this, I did forget we need to take our RGB outputs here and plug these back in like so. And there we go. Now we've got proper normals looking on our object here. So let's apply and save.",
