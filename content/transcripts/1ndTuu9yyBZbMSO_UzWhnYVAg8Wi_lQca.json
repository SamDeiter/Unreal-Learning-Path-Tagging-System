  "text": " In this section, we will continue going over the steps for using the custom body workflow. We will first initialize the script and load everything into memory. And then we will execute step 1 and step 2. So let's go over initializing the script first. The steps to initialize the script are to first ensure you have pasted the entire API interface script into the script editor. Then select the script from line 1 to 72 and execute it. To set the DNA calibration path and paths for the working folder, select line 75 to 105 and execute that. Let's jump into Maya and go through this. Inside of Maya, we will begin by initializing the script. I'm going to scroll down here, past all this code and references to other scripts, and I'm going to select everything from line 72 all the way up to 1 and then we'll execute this to load this into memory. Now I want to set the paths to the directories. So I will select everything from line 75 to 106 and execute this. We can now start executing each step. Let's begin with step 1, which will position and scale the head rig for integration. Over here I will select the first portion of step 1 from line 114 to 126 and execute it. Once this is finished loading, over here, this will load the body-combined rig into the scene. It has taken a copy of the head LOD0 from the MetaHumanDNA head mesh over here and named it Position and Scale Mesh. If we had not used the previous DNA calibration script, the mesh would be much smaller and would probably be somewhere over here. For this portion of step 1, we would select the Position and Scale Mesh and just as we had done with the locator, we would manually position and scale it. The next step is to run the second part of step 1. Select this section over here from line 133 to 146 and execute it. This will bake the position and scale to a new MetaHumanDNA file named Updated Scale, which will be added to the output folder in the DNA Files folder. It will then load the updated scale DNA with the body rig into a new scene. Now that it is loaded, if I select the head group from this new DNA file, on the right over here, if we had made adjustments, we will see that there would be no transformed values as those have been baked into the DNA. Another thing this command will do is it will match the head mesh and skeleton position with the body skeleton position. Now before we move on to step 2, let's do a quick review of what we just covered. Step 1 will position and scale the head rig for integration. Select the first portion of step 1 from line 113 to 126 and run it. This will load the MetaHumanDNA head meshes and joints and the body rig Maya file into a new scene. A copy of the LOD0 head geometry named Position and Scale Mesh will appear, since the Atomic Savage character has already been scaled and positioned from the previous workflow. The images on the right demonstrate what the unmodified version of the Atomic Savage DNA head mesh would look like. From here we would need to position and scale the head. Using the Position and Scale Mesh, we would manually position and scale the head, as is shown in the images on the bottom right. This is similar to how we used the Locator in the previous workflow, with the values being almost the same. Once we are happy with the scale and position, we can run the second portion of step 1 from line 133 to 137. This portion of the script will bake the position and scale to a new DNA file named Updated Scale. We can then review the new DNA file by running the last portion of step 1 to load the DNA. Once we run the last portion of step 1 from line 143 to 146, this will load the updated scale DNA file and the body rig into a new scene. What we can see in the images on the bottom right is that the mesh and joint positioning of the new DNA matches the body rig position. Again, this is very similar to the previous workflow we went over, where it scales and translates the rig. Now let's take a look at step 2 before we jump back into Maya. For step 2, if we were using the original Atomic Savage MetaHuman DNA file, for the first portion of this step, we would create a new neutral mesh using the updated scale DNA file in order to blend the neck area with the body. The images on this slide demonstrate what this process would look like if we were to use the original Atomic Savage DNA file. The first and second image show what the neck scene would look like after step 1, and the third image shows what the neck scene would look like after we have authored a new neutral mesh. Using the LOD0 head mesh from the updated scale DNA file, we would blend the neck vertex positions from the body with the neck area, and then export this as an OBJ file. We would then place it in the assets folder. If using your own character, let's go over the steps for creating the new neutral mesh. To create a new neutral mesh with the updated neck scene, in a new Maya scene, use the DNA Viewer run in MayaScript to load the updated scale DNA file. For the Meshes option, assemble only the head LOD0 mesh and leave everything else unchecked, as shown in the image on the bottom left. From there, take the head LOD0 mesh and manually fit the neck geometry in order to integrate it with the body while respecting the edges and loops. Once the head mesh is properly fitted to the body, export that as an OBJ file and add the new head mesh to the assets folder. Back in Maya, after the new neutral mesh has been created and placed in the assets folder, Next we want to ensure that the path for the new neutral mesh OBJ file is correct on line 156. From there, select everything from line 153 to 175 and execute it. This will update the DNA using the new neutral mesh OBJ file, and then match the core joints of the spine, neck, and shoulders to the body rig. It will then load a new Maya scene so that we can inspect it. Now that this is finished loading, I am going to go into Top View and I'm going to show the skeleton. I will select the head group so that we can see the skeleton, and then select the body. And if we inspect the skeletons, we will see that the head joints are now aligned with the body, which is exactly what we wanted. Now let's do a quick review of step 2 before moving on. For step 2, once the new neutral mesh has been authored using the updated scale DNA, and then added to the assets folder, make sure that the path to the new neutral mesh has been set correctly, and then select everything from line 153 to 175 and execute it. This will update the DNA using the new neutral mesh OBJ file, and the core joints of the spine, neck, and shoulders will match the body rig. With the head joints aligned with the body joints, as demonstrated in the images on the right, we can then proceed to step 3. Now that's it for this section. In the next section, we will continue going through the rest of the steps for the custom body workflow.",
