  "text": " To get our project started, we're going to jump over to our Epic Games launcher, and we're going to do a couple things. The first thing that we need to make sure is that we have our 4.27 engine installed. Now, at the time of this recording, it's 4.27.1. You may have 4.27.2, 4.3, et cetera. So for this, if you do not see the engine version here, go ahead and click the plus, which will install a new version of the engine. You'll get this gray kind of background icon. Click it and then select 4.27 from the drop down list, and then go ahead and click install. Once that's been installed, we're going to go ahead and hit launch, and this should launch the project window, allowing us to create a new project, whether that's a blank project or using one of the templates. Now, we are going to be using one of the preset templates, which is going to be the automotive product design and manufacturing. So from that, all I'm going to do is underneath my select or create new projects like the automotive product design and manufacturing, we'll hit next, and you can choose any of the presets that you want. However, for this one, I'm just going to go ahead and choose the blank one. So we'll click next, and then you can, of course, choose if you want ray tracing enabled or disabled, and if you want any starter content included. Finally, you'll select the folder and the name for the project that you want and go ahead and click create project. I'm going to cancel out of this since we already have the project set up. But once that's done, the project should open automatically for you. OK, let's go ahead and jump on over to our actual project in just a second. All right, I've jumped over into the project that's actually provided with this class, as opposed to just using the blank one. So we're going to get started from here. Now, the first thing that I want to make note of is that when we created our project, we used a predefined template. Now the important thing here is that a template doesn't necessarily create files based off of a totally different subset engine. In fact, what the templates are doing is they are just pre-setting some flags inside of our engine to match what that production preset is. So for example, if I go under edit and I go to project settings, what I'm going to search for here is reflection. And what I'm looking for is reflection capture resolution. Now, by default, this is going to be set at 128. However, when we use the automotive preset, it's going to flag this at 2048 to give us that higher resolution that we need. Additionally, we're going to have things like our extended default luminance range. We're going to have our default RHI set to direct X 12 if we're using ray tracing, as well as a host of other different things that will be enabled again to match that production preset. It's very important to note here that again, it's not like you're getting a different version of the engine when you create based off of a preset. In fact, it is the opposite. You have the same engine you would use as if you created a blank project from scratch. Again, a lot of these presets are set up ahead of time. Now, one of the advantage here, if you are curious as to what settings are being flagged, what plugins are being enabled, all you need to do is go to the dot you project file, right click on it and open it with any text editor. And what you will see is you'll see all the plugins that have been enabled for that particular project. This is very useful, especially if you're creating a project and new project or you're coming into a project that's been in the works now for a little bit. You absolutely can go to that project and you can enable these settings. Again, most of these things are going to be in your edit project settings. We'll find things that you saw as I typed in reflection, you'll see reflection capture resolution, things like if I type in extended default luminance range, etc. And then the other place where things usually get flagged are your plugins. So for example, if I look at say for example, open VR, type in open, and you'll see that open XR is enabled because again, the assumption is that if you're working with automotive visualization, generally speaking, most folks that actually use this type of workflow, do it in conjunction with an HMD. And again, you can go in, you can disable you can enable more things, you're not locked into because you created it based off this template, you're now stuck, you have to go create a new project. No, all these settings are again just flagged, you can turn them off, you can turn more things on, you can do whatever you'd like with it. Again, that's just using our default kind of project workflow. All right. That'll wrap up this chapter. Let's go ahead and move on to importing our content.",
