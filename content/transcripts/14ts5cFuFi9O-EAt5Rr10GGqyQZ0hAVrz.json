  "text": " In this video, we'll look at some of the core concepts of using OSC, specifically inside Unreal Engine. The first step and the only step we need to take to start using Open Sound Control inside Unreal Engine is to go to the Plugin tab and enable Open Sound Control plugin. You'll see a number of other plugins inside here that use OSC, which are not necessary for this course. Suffice to say, they can be used in various environments, such as with virtual production, or even something like Live Link Face if you wanted to remotely trigger a capture session. So let's start with a simple scenario for Open Sound Control communication. It is a peer-to-peer protocol, which means we have one as a sender and one as a receiver. So let's start with this very basic scenario where we have computer A and computer B, and computer A is trying to send message to computer B. Now let's look at what we are going to use it inside Unreal Engine projects. There are two key components we're going to use. One is OSC Client and one is OSC Server. For an OSC Client, OSC Client is kind of a node or a component we're going to use to send message, and an OSC Server is a receiver which listens to the OSC messages sent from the client. For those who are familiar with more traditional multiplayer setups or using something like web sockets, this might seem a little bit inverted, which yes, we feel that way as well, so rest assured. Traditionally, you would have a server who is sending messages to a client who is receiving them. But yes, in this scenario for OSC, you actually have the client who sends messages to the server who receives them. Now let's look back to our OSC SendPost scenario where computer A tries to send a message to computer B. Now we said that the computer A as the sender has an IP 8.8.8.8 and computer B as the receiver. It has the IP of B.B.B.B and it has port B.B.B.B forwarded to computer B. So now on computer A, computer A wants to create an OSC client targeting computer B. So in this node, the send IP address, we're going to put in computer B's address, B.B.B.B.B, and we want to specify that we're going to send this message through the port B.B.B.B.B. where we know it's already opened on B's side. Right, and just noting, of course, that IP addresses and ports are almost always, to my knowledge, numbers. We're just using letters here to be illustrative. Also note that even if you're working on a local area network where everyone's on the same subnet, you don't actually need to open any ports, but you do need to put a port number in here to match across the server and client or the message will not successfully send. Also, the client must have a unique name as does the server. Don't go ahead and just name your server, you know, computer and then name your client computer. And then all clients also need a unique name. You can call them client one, client two, et cetera. But if anything is duplicated, then the message will also not successfully send. And you won't have a very useful error message informing you of the reason why. As you might be able to tell, we have run into this issue before. Computer B as a receiver, in order to receive the messages from computer A, computer B will need a OSC server. So on computer B, that's used to create OSC server node. And inside this node, we have to put in the receive IP address and the port. So the receive IP address, we don't need to specify who we're receiving it from. OSC server is just a representation of computer B. So it's there and listening to any coming messages. So in the receive IP address, we can either put in computer B's IP. In this case, we use b.b.b.b as a representation, or we can just leave it blank. And it will by default, try to use the first IP address it can got from the computer's system. And in the port, we're going to put in the open port for computer B. So in our case, we use b.b.b.b to show it. But in reality, remember, it must be a number based port. So once we put into those two information, this OSC server will know that it is representing the computer B address and is listening to any OSC message coming from port b.b.b.b.b. And by default, the start listening will be checked, but just double check to make sure it is checked. So it is listening to the coming messages. And same as OSC client, we need to give the server a unique name. On this slide, we're showing some of the additional nodes that you have access to when you're sending an OSC message. And rest assured, we'll go over all of these in more detail. But just note, for example, the center column where we're seeing values like add float, add string, add bool, add integer. This should give you a sense of the wide variety of different kinds of messages that can be sent using OSC. Now let's look how a receiver side is getting those messages. So on the receiver side, we can use get OSC message flow at index, get OSC message string at index, get bool at index, etc. So we can see that we can use these nodes to get different kinds of values and from different orders. So say we send a message with the first one is a float and the second one is a string. We can imagine that we're going to start to combine things together and we get the float at index zero and we get the string at index one, etc. So this is a way we can start to create and receive a more complicated OSC message structure. And note that we're using an event delegate here. Again, we'll go over this in more detail, but this would be the traditional way to make sure that the correct messages are being received. Now let's see how to structure an OSC message. Now let's say computer A wants to send a float to computer B with the address slash test slash send float and the value of the float will be 0.35. Now the first step is we want to make an empty OSC message. As you can see here, this is the make OSC message. This will be an empty one. We can start to fill things inside. So first thing we want to set the address. So inside Unreal, we can use this node convert string to OSC address and we can type in our string or actually will be our address here slash test slash send float. Now we have this message. The output of this message will be the same OSC message, but now with the correct address. So we get this output and we add a float to this OSC message and our value would be 0.35. Now we still continue to grab the output of this message and we want to grab our OSC client, which is now targeting computer B. So we will send this message to our computer B OSC client here with a send OSC message node. And finally, we want to clear the OSC message just like a best practice. So we make sure the next one we're sending has a clear start. Right. And we can either make an OSC message like we have here at the beginning or this can be a variable that is saved and reused. I will just say you should be careful about that because it's very easy to accidentally resend old data, which is why it can be useful to make a fresh OSC message each time. Also, please note that at the beginning of the string when you're converting to an OSC address that that front slash is very important. It will not work without that first slash. Now let's move on to computer B. So now we know computer A already sent a float value of 0.35 to computer B and B wants to receive this message. And we will use this float value to change an actor scale according to the received float. So now let's see how to structure this on the B side. So first, we will drag our OSC server, which we already created as a new one. The one we already created is a representation of computer B. It is continued to listen to the coming OSC message from port BB BB. And now we know we want to find an OSC message with the specific address called slash test slash send float. So we will start with this node convert string to OSC address. And inside the string, we will put in the OSC message address. And we want to bind an event to our OSC server here, which so this event is called bind event to on OSC address pattern matches path. So it was continued to listen to new OSC messages and will filter and check if there's any OSC message with the same address we set here. If it matches, it will trigger this custom event to fire here. And now when this event is triggered, we want to get the float value from this message. The way to get it will be drag out from this message output here, and we will use the node get OSC message float at index. In our case, we know we want to get the index zero, the first one. So we use this node and will output a value. And we know we want to change an actor scale using this float value. So we will just hook into set actor scale 3D and we will convert the float value into a vector 3D. On this slide, we're looking at how to construct an OSC bundle, which allows you to send as many OSC messages as you'd like. In the example we're demonstrating here, we're showing how to send an XYZ coordinate value. So you can see where we have convert string to OSC address. We're using the pathing of float X, float Y, float Z, and all of that gets added into OSC messages, which are then added into a single bundle. The one OSC bundle is sent. We clear it, clear the messages and then can once again send this again. So this is not unlike the way that you would replicate the transform values of say a player in a scene. But instead of doing this in a traditional multiplayer setting, we can do it entirely with OSC signals. In the next video, we'll look at how to configure your firewall and set up port forwarding to ensure that OSC works as expected.",
