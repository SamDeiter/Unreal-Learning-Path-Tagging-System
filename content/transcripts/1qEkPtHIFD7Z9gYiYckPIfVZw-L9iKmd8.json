  "text": " I want to revisit a certain cool aspect of texture mapping. We're basically doing some pretty fancy stuff with texture mapping. But that's nothing compared to what some other people have done. For example, in our content browser, there's this folder called one texture sample. I just want to talk about this briefly because it's an amazing idea. Before we look at this, I want to introduce you to... Well, actually, let's look at this. We'll just double click on it to open it. It opens in its own editor, an editor that we've seen before, texture editor. And this is... Well, we've seen how you can use a texture to filter other textures. You can also use the channels of a texture. We can call up a single channel, as we did earlier with just the red channel. We can view these channels in a texture map, you may recall, by using in the viewport this view. And we can see all of the channels have been selected, but we can turn them on and off selectively. So that, for example, we can look at only the alpha map. And we can see in the alpha map, there's all this information. And just as with the diamonds before, this is something that can be used as a filter. It can be applied. And one of our artists, Sean Spitzer, created this one texture sample where he has this in his alpha channel. It can be used for labeling things, for creating, say, a holographic keyboard, all sorts of other things. Once you have control over your U and V, as we've shown you how to do, you can isolate how parts of this map are used and apply it to parts of a mesh or a whole mesh through tiling and control of UVs. And you can do this for each of the channels or multiple channels. So alpha is one channel. This is another channel. It's almost entirely different or entirely different, really. And it could be applied to a different mesh for different purposes. Combined with other nodes, you could add colors to it. Using lighting, you could add other effects. It's amazing what you'd be able to do. This could be used for displacement, for example, or used as a bump map, combined with the blue channel for other attributes. Additionally, you have, say, in the red channel, an overall roughness map that you could use to be, it could be applied to any one of these other channels in a separate material element. So you could get a massive amount of function out of one simple single map. Now, why is this useful? Why is this important? There was an artist at Epic with an amazing name. His name was Tor Frick. And he took this idea of using a single map and using it in multiple ways. He really kind of took it to its limit. And Tor Frick 3D artist, here's his address, the address for this one texture map environment. And he took a single texture map, similar to the one that we just saw, and used it for all of the maps in this environment. Now, he was sort of trying to prove a point that you could do this and get a massive, a lot of bang for your buck. Let me turn the sound down. And you can just, you can see just how you have really a complete environment. And he did this, all the maps for this environment with two texture maps that were 256 by 512. So not even a K, not even a meg in size. Incredibly efficient. And given what we see here, incredibly rich in detail. Now, he's using lots of other things, lights and reflections and all sorts of all sorts of meshes used to filter light and reflections to get these effects. But his actual texture maps, you know, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny. And just an amazing thing. And this was done in a version of Unreal Engine that was distributed in 2012 and is no longer available. But you can read about it on his website. And see his results. And they're really astonishing. And that's, this is what you can do when you really push your understanding of UVs and your insane level of control and deep understanding of how you can use texture maps. This is what you can do with it. And as I said, our artist, Sean Spitzer is working on sort of his own pet project using using that same idea of a single texture map. But his map is 4K, more than four times larger than the one that Tor Frick was using. So he can get more detail into it. Anyway, he's in the middle of sort of putting this thing together. But it's really an impressive thing to try to get this to work and have control over every channel and where it goes. You know, bravo. It's just, I can't wait to see how it turns out.",
