  "text": " So with the shared pointer library we've talked a little bit about like object lifetimes and their kind of life cycles. It's worth going back again to our UObject and down from that hierarchy and talking actually about what happens to an object once we create it. So in the simplest form for just a UObject, Unreal has a rather than saying new UObject whatever, Unreal has its own specific function to use which is new object and that's a templated function so we provide the type that we want to create an instance of. And then that goes through a series of steps. First off we have malloc, actually just like assigning, setting aside the memory on our computer. We have a men set zero which is essentially clearing out all the pre-allocated, all the values that might already be in that data we just allocated. Then we call the classes constructor and that initializes our V table, initializes all properties within that block of memory. Next we copy over the archetype with a mem copy. Unreal has this thing called the class default object which is where we get all our defaults from. So at post construction initialization that's essentially where we copy all the values from that class default object as our kind of defaults. Next we have the actual get defaults function. This essentially is an opportunity to inject data from innings, from config files that we might have elsewhere. So in Unreal you can specify certain actors or whatever, the inherit data from innings which lets you set that data outside of the class itself in a config folder, in config files. So that will get pulled in at this point. And then last of all we have this function called post init properties. And that's essentially our opportunity to inject, it's typically where you would inject gameplay functionality. So anything that you need to run after you know all the default values have been assigned. In the context of an actor, actors are kind of again a big fundamental building block of the game. It's a much more substantial class, there's quite a lot more complexity to the way an actor establishes itself once we create one or once we load one in. So when it comes to spawning an actor, in the kind of smallest simplest way it would look a little bit like this. Transform for anyone who's not familiar with the term is basically just a location, a rotation and a scale. It's probably a term you're familiar with from other packages. And this is how we would create an instance of an object of an actor by spawning it. So as you can see we get access to our world, so all actors and components inherently have knowledge of the world they're in. The world is most of the time is the single global entity that represents your game level right now. It's a slightly complicated concept because there's a distinction between levels and worlds in Unreal. But the world there is one of these at runtime, technically there's a separate one for the editor but we won't talk about that right now. But it's your kind of runtime world and everyone shares the same idea of the world that they're in. So you get access to that world and then you call spawn actor and this is a templated function. And one of the simplest implementations you can do is you provide it a class to spawn. So in Unreal whenever you have a C++ actor type or C++ U object type you have access to the static class which is basically that thing, the class of that object. And then you just provide it a spawn transform, so a location and rotation scale to spawn it. You technically don't even need to provide the transform if you just want the object. I assume it would default to 0, 0, 0. But yeah, this is the most common simple one. There are plenty of overloads of this function where you can provide a little bit more detail about actors you might want to own this actor or something like that. It's worth highlighting as well here that the templated type doesn't need to align with the class that you specify. So this is essentially just performing a cast for us. So if it's a spawn actor A exploding barrel, this would be OK. But if I had my type over here as A exploding barrel, then this would need to be at least A exploding barrel for it to cast properly into the pointer. So like I said, actors are quite a bit more substantial than U objects. If you were to jump into the actor header you would see it's got a lot of functionality and a lot of data in it. So there's quite a few more steps. Internally within the actor, some key functions we care about when spawning one in or generally as part of its lifecycle would be initializing components, which is one of the first things that it does. Obviously, as we spoke about before, actors can contain many components. And if it's a blueprint actor, it needs at least one scene component. And so each of those components get individually initialized. Those components will then have functionality called on them to say, you know, we're initializing these components. They'll have their own internal life cycles. But we have some functionality called before we initialize our components and just after we've initialized our components. And then we call begin play. Begin play is essentially the kind of universal we have started in the game now. There's a few different ways that can get called, but it's kind of like our generic start point. And then over the lifecycle of an actor, a really common function is our tick. I'm going to mention about this before, but tick is essentially our function that gets called once every frame by default. It's important to highlight that we can turn tick off for actors that don't need it. We can also specify a tick frequency. So by default, it's once every frame and that function, the time that that frame has taken will be passed into that function. So we have access to this delta time. It's a concept that we'd be very familiar with for anyone who's done games programming before. But just if you're not, yeah, that's that's what it is. It's the change between the frames, the amount of time we took from this frame to the last one. And we can use that in things like movement where we want to smooth it out. So we're not getting sudden big jerks in movement just because our frame took longer. And yeah, essentially the we can specify a tick frequency specifically if we want something that is maybe ticks once every frame. So it may be ticks once every second. So we need to do something repeatedly throughout an object's lifetime, but it doesn't need to be every frame. We can we can specify that. Yeah, and then once an object gets once an actor gets destroyed, we would call its end play. That should be more specific once an actor is removed from the world, because there's a lot of different ways that can happen, which we'll go into in a moment. And essentially end play is just the opposite of begin play. It's our stripped down function as our cleanup functionality. And then something that would kind of could and would commonly invoke end play is our destroy. So it's worth kind of breaking that down specifically. This is destroy typically the function you would take a call to get rid of an actor, say once it's died or something like that. And then that would call begin destroy. And then it goes through a couple of different steps and then it calls finish destroy. And then finally, after that, we call free. So it's only it's worth highlighting that again, we talked about this a little bit in the garbage collection. When we call destroy, that's when we would get our pending kill flag gets marked up and then that would get marked up in for our garbage collection. But it's only the point that it gets garbage collected that our free is actually called. So technically that object still exists in our memory until it gets garbage collected. So looking more in depth at kind of a full life cycle on actor, as I said, there's there's quite a lot more context to how an actor can come about to being. So you can see here on the left, this is kind of to describe actors that are already present in the world when we start. And on the right here, this is an actor that we spawn in. So immediately you can see there's kind of two ways that we might typically spawn an actor in. We can either spawn an actor in immediately or we can defer that spawn. The reason for this is if we have we need to be able to inject some additional functionality or do some things to that actor before it actually gets kind of registered within the world properly. That might be saying specifying that this actor owns this actor and we need to know that before begin play. Or we could assign some values or update some variables or things like that. That might be a reason we might want to defer that spawning or we just have the immediate spawn. And on the left here, like I said, these are the various ways that an actor might already exist in the world. So if it's just in our world and then we hit play an editor, if we have loaded into a map from another map or if we have called add to world gets called when we have streamed the level in. And as you can see, they a few different functions get called. So our construction gets called when we spawn it for objects that are already in the level construct gets spawned as they get dragged into that level with a further photo. So in your editor, you would have construct called as you drag that actor in, but construct the post the execute construction on construction post that construction that wouldn't be called as part of this flow because it's constructed at editor time. Whereas these are constructed at runtime. But then they share this pre the kind of steps that we spoke about before the pre initialized components initializing components, the post initialized components. And then they share this begin play and that's kind of like our standard starting point. And then after that point, we just go on to the rest of the gameplay, whatever we're doing. That's when ticking would occur. And then we have this kind of similar. We have a reflection of that begin play process with our end play. So there's a whole bunch of ways that an actor could come to ending its its kind of ending play, I suppose. The actor could get destroyed when you spawn an actor. You can specify a lifetime for the actor. You can do that in blueprint or in C++ and say this is this actor only exists for three seconds. If you have something like a visual effect or maybe a bullet that you just want to automatically get cleaned up after a few seconds, you can specify a lifetime. So at the point that lifetime is exceeded, it will automatically get destroyed. When we transition levels, the Unreal automatically just destroys every actor in the level we're in at the moment. It's not really intended that actors persist between scenes between full levels. There's slight caveat there about levels that get streamed in. But yeah, mainly when we transition whole worlds, we would clean up all the actors in that level. If we stop play, so if we're in a play in editor session, then we stop play, all the actors in that game world will get destroyed. If the game is just closing down or the game is ending, these are both situations where we would kind of begin this flow. Worth highlighting as well that end play actually gives you information about the way in which this actor is getting destroyed. So we can have a little bit more context about precisely what is happening that has led to this actor getting destroyed. So again, our end play functionality is called. We can override that and do any extra stuff that we need to do there. At this point, our actor gets marked for a pending kill, which is relevant to our garbage collection. Then it gets removed from our U levels array of actors. Again, if the level is transitioning, that's less relevant. But obviously if this is an actor that's destroyed mid level, then it's good to know that actor is no longer in our array of actors. And then finally, later when our next garbage collection gets hit, that's when the rest of this stuff occurs. We call beginDestroy isReadyForFinishedDestroy gets checked against. And then finally we call finishDestroy. And it's after that that the memory is freed. So again, just to touch about this a little bit before, but just to highlight again that the actor is still around in memory until we get garbage collection. And it's only as garbage collection occurs that this beginDestroy and finishDestroy are finally called.",
