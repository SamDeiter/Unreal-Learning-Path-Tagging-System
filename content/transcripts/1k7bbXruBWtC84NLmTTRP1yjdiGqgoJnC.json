  "text": " In this section, we will tackle the creation of a CineCamera Control Rig for better cinematic control in Unreal Engine. Now you might be wondering what is the reasoning behind creating a Control Rig for a CineCamera. Well, one thing that most often gets overlooked is the pivot point of the CineCamera. The pivot point of the CineCamera is located at the front center point of the lens hood portion of the CineCamera proxy mesh. If you have ever worked with a real-world camera, then you might realize that the pivot point should probably be located approximately at the point where the camera body attaches to the plate. However, if you simply move the pivot point in the camera blueprint, then the SM camera mesh will appear in the viewport and render view, as this also moves the camera component or what is essentially the CineCamera actor's camera sensor. The solution is to create a Control Rig for the camera. Try to follow along as I take you through the steps to build one inside Unreal Engine. But don't worry, after we build it in Engine, we will come back to the slides and review what we have done. Now, let's jump into Unreal Engine and get to work. Move into the Cam Tools folder, and then into the CRCamera folder. Here you will find examples of a completed Control Rig that you can use as reference if you get stuck. But we're going to build a new CineCamera Control Rig from scratch. Start out by right-clicking in the empty space in the Content Browser. And to create the Control Rig, let's go right up to the Animation option, and down into the Control Rig submenu, and select Control Rig. Let's go ahead and name this CRCineCamEx for example. Next, we'll need a CineCamera, but we can't use the camera from the Place Actors tab since we will need to make some modifications. So for our camera, we're going to need to locate the CineCamera actor C++ class actor, which is located inside the Engine Content folder. Navigate down to the Engine Content folder. And then double-click into the C++ Classes folder. Then go ahead and type in Cinematic here at the top. That will bring up several options, and you'll find the Cinematic Camera Actor. This is located in the Public folder if you're just going to dig through folders. Now, to make a copy of this, we need to create a Blueprint class. So, right-click on the CineCamera Actor and choose Create Blueprint Class Based on CineCamera Actor. This will bring up a pop-up menu that allows us to name and move the new CineCamera Actor. Let's name this BP for Blueprint, CineCam, CR for Control Rig, and EX for example. And let's choose the folder we're going to put this in. So we'll navigate to our Courses folder, inside the course, scroll down to the Cam Tools, and choose the CRCamera folder. Go ahead and then hit Create Blueprint Class. This will automatically open the Blueprint CineCam CR example, but we're going to use this a little bit later. For now, hide this menu, go back to our CRCamera folder, and let's double-click to open the CRCineCam example Control Rig Blueprint, since we want to start working on our Control Rig setup. Let's begin by creating our Controls and Bones. To make this go faster, let's create five Controls and three Bones back-to-back. We'll start out inside the Rig Hierarchy tab, and in the Import Hierarchy box here, let's go ahead and right-click and choose New. And create a new Control. Now, let's go ahead and make sure that that Control is selected, and hit Control D to make four more copies. Now we can select two Controls at once, Control D, and then do it one more time. We'll rename these a little bit later, and then reorganize them shortly after we finish making our Bones. So let's do the same thing, right-click, go up to New, and Bone. And from here, again, let's go ahead and duplicate one more time, and that gives us our three Bones. Now, let's start renaming our Controls. The first one, we're going to name Root CTRL for Control. The next one, we're going to go ahead and name Plate Proxy, as this will be a Proxy Control. The next one after that, let's go ahead and name Pan Control. And after that, let's name this one Tilt Control, as we're going to be controlling our Pan and Tilt. And finally, we're going to need to name one more Control, and that will be called our Pan Tilt Proxy. Now let's rename our Bones. First Bone we're going to name is our Root. The next Bone is going to be our Cam Plate. And last is going to be a very important Bone for us, this is our BP Attach Point. Now we need to stack the Controls in order. And then we'll do the same for our Bones. So first, let's go ahead and take our Plate Proxy and move that into our Control. Then we're going to take our Pan and move that in, and our Tilt, and finally our Pan Tilt Proxy. Next we'll go ahead and do the same with our Root and move our Cam Plate up under the Root, and our BP Attach under the Cam Plate. So your hierarchy should look like this. One thing to note here is that the BP Attach Point, Bone, needs to have its initial state location set to 60, 0, and 20, to move the connection point out to where the CineCamera's pivot point is currently located. Now we can have some fun, changing the shape properties of the Controls. This is entirely up to the user to decide what their Control Rig will look like, but I'm going to make some changes based on what I think works. Feel free to follow along or play with your shape types and positions. Now I'm going to start with my Root Control, and I'm only going to do this one Control at first and then skip ahead to the finished product. You can change any of these Controls to whatever your user preference is, but I'm going to show you what needs to be done to this setup. So, first I'm going to move over to the Details panel and go into the Shape section. And here I'm going to choose a hexagonal shape, and I'm going to choose a thick hexagon. Now I'm going to go ahead and change some of the scale properties here, so my Root property scale is going to be set initially to 8. I'm doing that because I want a larger Control that I can grab that's going to fit the size of the camera. Now I don't need to make any other changes to my Root Control, but you're free to change the color or any other aspect of this by clicking on the color. And let's say I go with a blue color for this particular shape. It's entirely up to you on what you want to choose, and any changes you make should be set to the shape's location in the transforms. Do not set your initial position. So, you're going to see a jump cut that's going to have a completed rig, but not everything is going to be filled in. I will talk to you about what the changes are in the Details panel for each one of these shapes. Okay, so I've chosen my Control set, and for my Root, as I mentioned, I went with a hexagon. For my Plate Proxy, I went with a thin square, and my Pan Tilt Proxy, I went with a thin triangle. For my Pan and Tilt Controls, I used wedges, and I made them thick so I could see them and then put them in specific positions. For my Pan Tilt Control, my Base Control was set at negative 60 on the X axis, and the Rotator was set to 90 degrees on the X axis as well. The Scale for both the Pan and Tilt Controls were set to 3, and the Tilt Control had the location Y axis changed to 30, and the rotation of the Y axis to 90. Now, that changed the shape of the shapes, and I'm going to go ahead and change the shape of the shapes. So, the default is 90. Now, that changed the default 0 for the other two Rotators to 180. Don't worry about that, it's just a quirk of the Control Rig System. Now, the important thing to note about the Pan and Tilt Controls is that they are going to need some filtered channels added to them in the Details panel, and this is done by creating an Array element. First, with the Tilt Control, let's go ahead and add an element, and then from here in the Index, we're going to change this to the Pitch. Next, let's move into the Pan Control and do the same thing. Add in a filtered Control Array and choose Yaw. This will set the Pitch and Yaw of our camera movement to the Control movements of the Pan and Tilt. Next, we need to make some changes to our Plate Proxy and Pan Tilt Proxy. Both of these are Proxy nodes. You can select both of them, move into their details, and change the animation type of these controls from Animation Control to Proxy Control. Once all your control shapes are set, we want to move into the RigVM Editor and start creating nodes for the forward solve. Right-click in the RigVM Editor and type Set Transform. Choose the Set Transform option. Do this again and right-click and type Get Transform. Then choose the Get Transform option and this will give you the Get Transform Bone. Now, I'm going to move these around. Move my Set Transform here and my Get Transform over here. In my Get Transform, I'm going to go ahead and make some setting changes. First thing is I'm going to make sure that my Get Transform is not set to Bone, but set to Control. And then the control I'm going to choose is going to be my Pan Tilt Proxy. Next, I'm going to make some connections. I'm going to start with my forward solve and connect it to my Execute Context in my Set Transform. Then I'm going to take the Transform out of my Get Transform control and put that into the Value option of my Set Transform. That will set this as a Set Transform Bone, but I need to select my node and move into the Details panel to choose the bone I want to actually move. That bone is going to be our cam plate. Now, let's go ahead and compile. That gets rid of the warning that we had. Now, let's verify quickly that the Set Transform's global space is set both in the Details panel and on the node itself. It should be reflective of each other. Same for the Get Transform control. Make sure that both are set in global space. Then let's move into the Blueprint for the CineCamera Control Rig or the BP CineCam CR example. If you don't already have that open, double-click on it to open up the Blueprint Editor. Start by moving up to the Components section and use the Plus Add button to add a Control Rig component. I'm going to take a moment and add the EX to the end of this Control Rig component to differentiate it from the example that's already saved inside the Control Rig folders. With the Control Rig EX selected, we're going to move over to the Details panel. And here we can move down to the Control Rig pulldown menu and select the Control Rig class. For us, we're going to choose the CR CineCam EX that we built earlier in this course assignment and assign that as the Control Rig class. After that, we're going to move back to our Components tab and select the Control Rig EX component directly. We do this because we need to add Event to this component so that the camera will move with the Control Rig without flying off into space once compiled. You can do this in one of two ways. The first is to right-click on Control Rig, move down to Add Event and select Add on Pre-Initialized Delegate. Or move over to the Details panel and select the plus button for On Pre-Initialize. This will automatically open up the Event Graph in our Blueprint. If this doesn't open the Event Graph automatically, just move up to the top tabs and select Event Graph. Now we need to start building out our Control Rig Blueprint. To give us some space, I'm going to recenter the On Pre-Initialize Control Rig EX here, just so it's a little bit out of the way. Next, I'm going to move up to my Components tab and drag my camera component into my Event Graph. This will create the camera component node that we need to work from. From here, I'm going to drag my camera component into my Event Graph. This is where we need to work from. From here, I'm going to grab the Execute Pin and drag out to search for Make Control Rig Component Mapped Component node. Once I have the Make Control Rig Component Mapped Component node, I need to move down into the element name and change the name to match our BP attach point. This is going to have to be typed in manually. And spelling does matter here. So make sure that you spell the BP attach point correctly and don't add any spaces or dashes that don't match what you've already typed in the original setup. Next, drag out from the Control Rig Component Mapped Component Execute Pin and search for a Make Array node. Next, we're going to drag out from the Arrays Execute node and search for the Add Mapped Components Control Rig EX example. Now, this may generate a Control Rig EX node automatically. But since we already have one built for our rig, you can go ahead and delete this node. Finally, just connect the On Pre-Initialized node to the Add Mapped Components node, making sure you connect the Components node to the target and then the Execute to the Execute. Once that's done, you're ready to compile and save. After you compile and save, let's verify that our camera moved to the correct connection point. That's easy enough to do by moving up to our viewport and clicking on the Control Rig. As you scroll around, you can see that the camera point joint has now connected to the front of the camera's pivot point as expected. Now we're ready to create a level sequence to play around with our camera. So let's collapse this window, move into the Content Browser, and right-click to move up to our Cinematic section and create a new level sequence. Let's name this Cam CR for Control Rig EX for example, and double-click to open it. Now you can drag the Blueprint CineCam CR example that we've created into our viewport. That will add the Blueprint to our Outliner, and from there, go ahead and drag this into Sequencer. Once this is dragged into Sequencer, let's disconnect the camera from the locked viewport. Move down to our Control Rig and select the Root Control. Move back up to our window and middle mouse to make that window active, and then press F to zoom out into our viewer. Now go ahead and grab the root and move this around. This should work with our camera. If not, go ahead and jump back into our Blueprints and select the CR Control Rig and just do a Compile and Save. Then do it again for our Blueprint, Compile and Save. That should correct the issue, and now if we grab our Control Rig and it moves, our camera should snap into place. Now we can keyframe and move the camera around and view what the camera is actually seeing. Feel free to play with your CineCamera Control Rig after this video, but for now, let's jump back into the slide deck. Now to review the steps we used in creating the CineCamera Control Rig. First, we created the Control Rig and then located the CineCamera Actor C++ Class Actor and created a new Blueprint copy of the CineCamera Actor, making sure it was moved to the CR Camera folder. Next, we built all the components of our Control Rig, first by creating five controls and renaming them RootControl, PlateProxy, PanControl, TiltControl and PanTiltProxy. After that, we created three bones and named them Root, CamPlate and BPAttachPoint. Then we nested them into the correct hierarchical order and changed the initial state location of the BPAttachPoint. After that, we changed the shapes of our controls and adjusted the shape transforms and animation types. Next, we moved into the Control Rig's RigVM Editor and created the nodes for our forward solve. Once created, we connected the nodes and then selected the Get and Set Transform details on the Get and Set nodes. Once we finished the setup, we moved back into the Control Rig Blueprint and added the Control Rig Component to the Blueprint and selected the Control Rig Class assigning the Control Rig EX we built to the component. Next, we dragged the Camera Component from the Components menu into the Event Graph and then moved down to the My Blueprint tab to select the Control Rig and Add Event, selecting the OnPre-InitializedDelegate event. Note, there are two ways to do that shown in this slide. Once the Camera Component was added to the Event Graph and the Add Event added, then we added a few more nodes to the Event Graph to set the Control Rig Component mapping while manually typing in the BPAttachPoint to the element name. Then we connected everything together and the end result should have looked something like what we have in this slide. Finally, we compiled and saved our Blueprint and Control Rig and then created a level sequence to drag and drop our newly minted CineCamera Control Rig into, making the CineCamera Control Rig ready for use in our Shot Creation Pipeline. And that's it for this section, creating the CineCamera Control Rig. In our next section, we will explore the Unreal Engine CineCamera tools that work within Sequencer, starting with the Camera Rigs.",
