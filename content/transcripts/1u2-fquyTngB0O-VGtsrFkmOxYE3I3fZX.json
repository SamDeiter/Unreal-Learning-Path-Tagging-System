  "text": " So, before we finish out this tutorial series, I just wanted to give you an overview and just really concrete what Blueprint is doing, how it's functioning and then I also want to give you a little tip at the end of the series of how to open multiple doors with one button press because I thought that'd be a nice little bonus addition. Again, you don't need to go back to it and if you feel like you're comfortable enough with Blueprints at the moment, that's great. I just wanted to give you some really drive home the point of Blueprints. So let's talk about Flow. As we saw when we were debugging, Flow always reads from left to right. So just make sure your Blueprints are always set up in such a way where the information is readable, we've not got crossing wires and that all your information is going from left to right. Events are functions that are often triggered by external influences. So as we saw before when we added begin overlap and end overlap, they were impacted by the player overlapping them, which is what we mean by external influences. Something has happened that has caused this event to fire. We can do functions of macros similar to C++, which was a little bit outside the scope of this tutorial, but again, we can still do functions of macros within Blueprints and we have input and output on the right side of nodes. So you've got inputs on this side, which is the string. So we're printing in a string that says out in this instance, bad choice of word in there, but I think you understand what I mean. And then you've also got the outputs on the right hand side there. We've got a whole list of different Blueprint variables. Again we use the Boolean in our example. We also use the Dar reference, but you can get bytes, integers, names, vectors, enums, whole list of things here. As you continue your Blueprint journey, you'll get more familiar with these concepts. And also we got a variable and we set a variable. So we call them getters and setters and then just all part of the power of creating Blueprints with variables. When we're talking about Blueprint components, we can hold a whole host of information. When you click that component drop down list, we were only really adding door frames and doors and begin overlaps, but there's a whole host of components that you can use here. You may have been confused by that default root scene component that you might have seen come with the Blueprint. That's given to all actors. You can actually get rid of it if you want, but the main thing to keep in mind is that you can child and parent the components like we did with the door and the door frame and all components will exist in that list. We have level Blueprints, which we didn't touch upon in this example today because we put all the functionality within that Blueprint. But if we wanted to add any functionality to the level Blueprint, we could go ahead and do that. You can go to the level Blueprint by going into your first person map and you can select the Blueprint graph here, an open level Blueprint. And there's a level Blueprint in here where if we type begin play, and again you don't need to do this, and if I print string here and I say level loaded, we'll just give it one exclamation mark now. And if we compile and save, and when we play the level, you can see that it says level loaded in the top left hand corner of the screen there. And all that means is that we've got some information specific to the context of this level that we can do here. Now you only really want to be doing certain things on the level Blueprint because say you go from one level to the next, if you put all your DAW code on this level Blueprint, if you went to a new level, say level two, you'd have to redo all that DAW functionality. So the good thing about housing it inside of a DAW Blueprint like this one is that you can use this DAW across multiple levels and all the information is housed within that Blueprint. So that's really useful to know. You can have data only Blueprints, which only contain code and script, and more often than not this will be the programmers on your team that are using them, but you can use them to tweak properties or set items with variations and they're impacted in more of a compact editor. So again, just good information, useful information for you to know about that. And we didn't touch upon Blueprint interfaces. As I said at the start of the tutorial here, Blueprint interfaces can be used as a communication method from one Blueprint to another. So as you continue your scripting journey, definitely look out for Blueprint interfaces because it can be a really powerful way of just sending a message from one Blueprint to another. Blueprint communications, we didn't touch upon casting, but you can cast, you can get an object reference and cast to say, is this the thing that you're looking for? Again, Blueprint interfaces are something that where you can send a message from one Blueprint to another, and you can also use event dispatchers, which binds one or multiple events and those can actually be called on the level Blueprint. A little bit outside of the scope of today's tutorial, but just to make you aware of these interface and functions. And the way we think about Blueprint scripting is that it's a compiler software that turns source code into machine language that can be executed by the CPU. So that requires changing depending on the hardware and operating system. And when the script has been created, it needs to be compiled. So as you saw in our example, we had to keep compiling and saving and that just makes sure Unreal knows what new code has been added so that it can execute it correctly. And then to finish off, we just want to talk about the Blueprint scripting framework here. And essentially Blueprints are all compiled into bytecode. So it's processed by a virtual machine. The virtual machine translates it by bytecode into the instructions and the hardware can understand what is actually being processed. And then we nativeize the Blueprint so we can take the Blueprint visual language and convert it to C++, which essentially just means you can have larger projects, it processes the code more quickly. And that's the kind of overview of Blueprint scripting framework.",
