00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
So let's talk a little bit about how you go about exporting and importing your FBXs and

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.520
the best pipelines to follow.

3
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.000
So the main rules of the skeleton are essentially the same rules apply to any skeleton setup.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.800
You should have one root bone in your mesh or your skeleton, should we say, that connects

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
to everything else.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.360
Root goes from zero zero to a central bone, e.g. a hip bone if you're using a humanoid

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.000
skeleton and this helps with root motion, which we'll talk about a little bit about

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
later.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.280
Your blending is based on a fully connected skeleton, so the hierarchy is key here and

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.840
even if you're not making a humanoid character, even with a vehicle, just making sure you

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.080
follow a good hierarchy is super important here.

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.360
When we talk about floating bones in new skeletons, the best practice is when creating your skeletons

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.040
not to use inline twist bones and instead you should parent the wrist bone to them and

14
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.080
then creating a leaf bone.

15
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.580
So typically this is used with organic skeletons, but it's useful to keep in mind there.

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.760
And then also when talking about hierarchy, especially when we're talking about automotive,

17
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.360
it is really, really important.

18
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.040
So always start with that root bone, usually at the center of gravity, wherever that might

19
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.520
be on the automotive vehicle, for example, even if your model's pivot was built around

20
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.960
zero zero zero, you want to extend from the root outward.

21
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.360
So super important to keep in mind when talking about hierarchies and bones.

22
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.080
When we look at a pre-made animation pipeline, you're looking at the model, the rig and the

23
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.520
animations inside of your DCC app, and then you import your animations into UE5.

24
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.320
So we may end up with the sequencer animation tracks.

25
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.000
These are from baked animation assets.

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.920
They're all blended, weighted, maybe additive animations.

27
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.840
And then you can modify the animations either using the sub editor, which is our old method,

28
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.840
or edit in sequence option, which you can edit with the FK control rig or baked to control rig.

29
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.000
That just gives you a little bit more freedom and flexibility over your approach there.

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.640
The in-editor animation pipeline.

31
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000
So you model and weigh in your DCC app.

32
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.120
So then whenever it comes to rigging and animating, you would actually use Unreal Engine 5 for this.

33
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.760
So you can use a control rig and you can build out all your animation controls here.

34
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.920
And it's turned on by default in Unreal Engine 5.

35
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.040
So if you're using any of the early access versions, just make sure you're in enable

36
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.240
control rig.

37
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.120
But from this point onwards, it will be on by default now.

38
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.040
So you shouldn't need to do anything to get access to control rig.

39
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.000
The sequence of key framing.

40
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.560
Control rig is animated using the level sequence.

41
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240
And then you build an empty level as a work area or you can animate directly in the scene.

42
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.960
So we'll talk about sequence in a little bit more detail in a few slides here to give

43
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.080
you a better idea about what sequence there is.

44
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.400
When it gets to the mayor export, we can select the items we want to export inside of mayor.

45
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.920
So your mesh and your joint chain root.

46
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.320
And we can export selected.

47
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.920
So just file export selected and select the FBX type.

48
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.400
Set the file type, sorry, to FBX.

49
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800
And you want to make sure the animation checkbox is there.

50
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.220
You want to include smooth and deforms.

51
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.480
Do you want to bake the animation?

52
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.880
So using Alembic to bake complex deformation, beyond blend shape and linear skinning.

53
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.160
So just a quick note here that a smooth mesh should be disabled and the smoothing groups

54
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
should be enabled.

55
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.200
So there's an image there of the type of properties you want to be setting just to give you an idea.

56
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.600
When it comes to 3ds Max, it's pretty much the same.

57
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.800
The Max and Mayor exporters have very few differences.

58
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000
So we've included an image anyway.

59
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.280
But they're relatively on parity there.

60
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400
And then Blender, we send it to the UE plugin.

61
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.680
So Epix created a plugin that allows you to export an FBX, which doesn't even include

62
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.880
meshes, but you can also export your rigs there.

63
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.280
And Epix playlist goes over installing and using the plugin, which will save you a lot

64
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.720
of time in your setup.

65
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.080
So to export your FBXs in Blender, you want to go to export and then FBX.

66
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.920
You want to make sure the fixed transform tickbox is applied there.

67
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.840
And armature, you want to disable add leaf bones.

68
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.320
The smoothing groups don't exist.

69
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.760
So auto smooth and split, apply modifiers, and then just make sure you uncheck the baked

70
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.760
animation.

71
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.000
And so you should be OK to go on the Blender from there.

72
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.280
So in Blender, forward is minus y.

73
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.160
So in Unreal, forward is actually positive x.

74
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.540
So you just want to make sure that your exports are set up in the right orientation here.

75
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.240
When you export the FBX, you want the default settings for the majority of this.

76
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.080
But also Shade and Auto Smooth for smoothing groups is selected there.

77
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.160
And you want to keep the scene model scale in mind.

78
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.000
So Blender defaults to a one meter per unit scale, whereas UE5 is one centimeter per unit.

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.760
So you just want to make sure.

80
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.160
So you're not trying to do any override scaling inside of Unreal.

81
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.460
You just want to make sure the units are set up correctly inside of Blender.

82
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.280
When we're exporting to Unreal, you need to provide the project's export settings only

83
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.320
once.

84
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.000
And it's not necessary to set the project again for subsequent export operations.

85
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.960
So enjoy exporting all your FBX animations.

86
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.200
And we'll move on to the next section.
