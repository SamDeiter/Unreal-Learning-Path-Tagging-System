00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
So, what do we just do in this workshop?

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.080
Well, we create a new socket and we attached it to a bone and the great thing about that

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.920
socket is that it will then move with the bone as we spoke about in the workshop there.

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.680
We can attach extra meshes, so it has multiple other purposes rather than just what we used

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.680
it for, but it's really good for designing an attached location for your items such as

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.520
door handles or mirrors or anything you may want to attach to a certain bone either at

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.160
run time or to preview a certain functionality.
