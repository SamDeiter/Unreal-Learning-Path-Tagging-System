00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
So, I'm starting with a look at the new animation features in Unreal Engine 5.0.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.980
We've got coverage on some of the animation node functions that are new to the editor

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.420
and also we'll look at the folder structure being slightly different than how you may

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.900
have seen it before.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.700
So animations are now stored in the sequences folder.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.080
So if you go to content, Manikin for example, if you are looking at the Manikin, the animations

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.340
folder there, you've got the sequences inside of that folder.

8
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.260
You can also edit in Sequencer with or without Control Rig and we'll talk about that later

9
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.880
in the presentation.

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.260
Some other new features mentionable.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.800
With 5.0 there have been many added improvements regarding animation.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.460
So some of these improvements include an IK retaggator and IK rig.

13
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.180
So essentially what we're saying here is that retaggating animations from one skill

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.620
set to another no longer uses the retaggating manager.

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.460
So using these two new tools, a new workflow has been created there.
