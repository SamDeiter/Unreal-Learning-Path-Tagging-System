00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Getting into a bit more detail now with the animation editor.

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.880
So we have the overall user interface here with the animations.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.400
We're talking about key frames so you can add additive animations and also curves to

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.000
this interface.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.360
So you see the list of animations on the bottom right hand side there of all the animations

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.240
that you currently have.

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.480
You can add notifications.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.200
So a classic example of this with animation notifies would be if you have a standard walk

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.440
animation and every time the foot hits the ground you want to notify Unreal to maybe

10
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.800
play a sound or something like this.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.520
So you could add a notify of every time the foot plants on the ground to then send a message

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.760
into Unreal somewhere.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.560
You can also record animations in this editor window as well.

14
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.120
So the animation editor with the asset browser.

15
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.800
So on the bottom right hand side, you have all your assets.

16
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
You can pop this out into its own window if you wanted to.

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.120
You can just drag and drop the windows however you want to layout the information.

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.380
But you can browse all the animations that you currently want to use and preview them

19
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.760
there inside the animation editor with the use of the asset browser.

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.540
So useful to kind of preview your animations that you've got here.

21
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.600
If you are editing the animation in Sequencer, you can edit with Control Rig here.

22
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.520
So you just want to use that drop down option and use edit with FK Control Rig and then

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
you'll get a baked to Control Rig pop up notification.

24
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.120
So you can edit your animations via the edit in Sequencer option in this instance.

25
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.720
When we're talking about Sequencer, Sequencer is a really powerful cinematic tool that comes

26
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.280
with Unreal Engine.

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.360
So we can create videos and cinematics and we can essentially play at runtime if we want

28
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.720
to maybe play it during a game cinematic sequence or something that's in engine that plays at

29
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.720
real time or render them as a video file in multiple different formats if you want something

30
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.320
pre-rendered.

31
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.280
We can create gameplay animations so we can bake out animation using Sequencer using that

32
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.580
take recorder that we were referencing before.

33
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.160
So if you set up a series of animations and you maybe add a walk cycle to some kind of

34
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.300
blend into a jump and then jog or something like this and they're all their individual

35
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.980
animations, you can actually play that out and bake it into its own animation which is

36
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.440
a really powerful tool.

37
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.940
We can also trigger events directly from Sequencer.

38
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.540
So if you want a certain event to trigger as the character gets to the middle of their

39
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.040
walk cycle for example or something like this, it will send out an event into Blueprints

40
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.300
and you'll be able to call different events directly from Sequencer.

41
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.260
Sequencer also comes with its own curve editor.

42
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.740
So if you want to refine any of the movement, any camera pans, anything like this, it comes

43
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.220
with its own curve editor which you can see as the icon on that main nav bar right in

44
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.020
the middle, the furthest icon on the right hand side but it's in the middle of that

45
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.020
window.

46
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.340
That's your curve editor.
