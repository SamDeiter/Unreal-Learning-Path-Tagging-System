00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
So with all that in mind, let's jump into Unreal and start creating a socket in one

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.020
of our skeletal meshes.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.100
So sockets is essentially just a point attached to a bone.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.080
And the great thing about sockets is they then move with that bone so you can attach

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.700
different components maybe at runtime.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.460
You can add essentially any extra mesh to that bone and it has multiple purposes.

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.900
So if you think about this car example, it's great for designing an attached location such

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.700
as a door handle or a mirror or something essentially that wasn't part of the rig that

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100
came into Unreal.

10
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.540
So let's go ahead and create a new socket just to show you what that process would be

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.820
like.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.180
So I've just got a car here and I'll hit CTRL and B in my content browser to find that

13
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.420
skeletal mesh in the browser.

14
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.500
So if I can open up the individual asset but just to show you going through the skeletal

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.780
mesh window which we were speaking about in the PowerPoint, if I went over to the skeleton,

16
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.820
I can see all of my bones here.

17
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.140
So again, I could have gone if I just drag and drop these windows just so you can see

18
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.080
my browser, I could have gone through the skeleton here.

19
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.220
But if you're going through this skeletal mesh and you're not sure where the skeleton

20
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.300
is located, that's how to get there.

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.620
So I went through the mesh and then clicked on skeleton which opened this window.

22
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
So you can essentially add a socket anywhere.

23
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.740
If you say, let's go for the hood maybe.

24
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.780
So over on the hood, say for example, we were attaching a windscreen wiper.

25
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.480
So this windscreen wiper isn't there by default.

26
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.360
Maybe we want to attach a windscreen wiper to the hood.

27
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.180
So we can just right click and add a socket.

28
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.380
And then it creates a socket name based on the bone name.

29
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.260
And so hood underscore body socket, that's a nice enough naming convention.

30
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I'm happy with that.

31
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.120
I don't need to rename it.

32
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.240
Now with the socket, the good thing about the socket in Unreal is that if I press space

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.120
bar and then space bar again, I'm just toggling through my widget here.

34
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.160
I can actually move this into a different location than what the bone would be.

35
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.520
So if I wanted this socket in a different location, for example, that's an easy way

36
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.600
to do that.

37
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.780
And so it's like offset from the bone which is here.

38
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.780
And that will move.

39
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.020
So say this bone was animated on the windscreen wiper, whatever the relative offset of this

40
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.260
socket was, that would follow the bone's orientation as well.

41
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.300
And just a little tip when you get into blueprints, if you are attaching a mesh to a socket or

42
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.980
something like this, you'd need to get the socket name.

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.300
So a lot of the time you could misspell the socket and the socket name needs to be specific

44
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300
inside a blueprint.

45
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.360
So you can either hit F2 or you can right click and rename socket.

46
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.780
And when that box opens, I just hit control C. And then when you're inside a blueprint,

47
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.740
you can just hit control V. That's copy and paste on the keyboard.

48
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.860
And that will essentially just paste in the socket name.

49
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.540
I like to do that just to make sure I know that the naming convention is all correct

50
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540
and working.

51
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.700
That's essentially how to add a socket to a skeleton in Unreal.
