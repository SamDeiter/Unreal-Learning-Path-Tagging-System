00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
So we've spoken a little bit about getting the content into Unreal Engine, how about

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.880
when we want to export from Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.080
So we can still use the FBX version, we can keep or remove the mesh and the information

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.280
that we're looking at here is vertex color, LODs, collision and animation mesh.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.120
So first time importing, you want to click the import inside the content browser, you

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.400
can either do this through the content browser or you can go to file import and you want

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.000
to select the FBX option.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.720
The first time you import a whole new character, you'll need to import the mesh and the skeleton

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.720
together.

10
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.080
So every subsequent import doesn't need the skeleton because Unreal will already have that

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.000
information but just make sure you do those together on the first import and skeleton

12
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.840
mesh needs to be checked and import mesh needs to be checked too.

13
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.960
So there's an image there of what we mean but just make sure skeleton mesh and import

14
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.540
mesh are both ticked on your import FBX options here.

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.000
So when we're importing animations, you can set the animation length, so the exported

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.360
time, do you want the whole thing, do you want the animated time or do you just want

17
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.640
to leave the animated parts here.

18
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.080
Are you setting your range so you can manually select the frames that you want to import

19
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080
here.

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.760
You've got the sample rate and also import bone tracks.

21
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.920
So you've got a lot of options at your disposal here.

22
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.480
A helpful important note would be the transform so you can compensate for any incorrect rotations.

23
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.440
So again, like we said before, you really should be fixing this in your DCC app to make

24
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.320
sure everything is one to one with Unreal Engine in your external package before you

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.320
import.

26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.600
We can override transforms here for example but it'll just lead to headaches later on

27
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.200
if you need to reimport anything and you forget that you've set certain issues and also just

28
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700
any scaling issues.

29
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.800
Just make sure ideally importing at a uniform scale of one is just the best default here.

30
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.080
Some miscellaneous options to talk about here, you could force front X axis just to

31
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.240
make sure that, say for example if you're using Blender and setting the X axis there,

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.880
you could tick that and you can convert the scene unit as well.

33
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.480
So when we're importing new animations for old skeletons, you would just go ahead and

34
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.080
import like normal.

35
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.060
You can select the skeleton you want and choose the animation length but just know if the

36
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.040
skeleton is exactly the same then this should be a very straightforward process.

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.440
If not, you may have to retarget it using the new retargeting tools which we briefly

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.800
went over before.

39
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.240
If you want to reimport an animation, you can just right click in the menu and reimport

40
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.160
the editor for more options.

41
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.840
So you'll see different dialog boxes here that you can use to reimport and you'll get

42
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.200
your import settings and just reimport using these settings and that should allow you for

43
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.460
some quick reimport from the base mesh there.

44
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.480
So we've got the skeleton mesh editor on the left details panel.

45
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.560
You can right click on the asset in the content browser and the skeleton mesh editor in the

46
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.120
top menu there.

47
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.120
If you are using animations from the library, so from the marketplace maybe, you can add

48
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.440
these to the project directly.

49
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.540
So you can just click add to project on any animation packs that you have or you can just

50
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.760
migrate the specific animations.

51
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.600
If you already had that project open and you want to bring them over to another project,

52
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.600
sorry, you can right click on the content, you can go to asset actions and migrate and

53
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.560
you can migrate these animations over to a different project and they'll bring the information

54
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.120
with them or you can just add them fresh to a new project.

55
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.960
So you're probably more likely than not to find yourself needing to be retargeting these

56
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.360
animations and it likely comes with its own skeleton in that instance, but it is possible

57
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.720
and very straightforward process to do.
