When we're looking at ways to approach animation in Unreal Engine, we've got a few different

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.960
animation types to go over here.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.920
So when you're animating within Unreal, you've got the input animation, linear animation,

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.040
and Live Link.

5
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.820
And so I'll just discuss a little bit about what each of these are.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.560
So input animation is typically where the user wishes to control or play the scene.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.600
Any inputs that they're pressing on a wide range of input controllers, whether it's

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.680
a touchscreen, iPad, gamepad controller, the animation system drives the animation

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.160
through pushing a capsule that talks to that animation system.

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.160
So then the output of that is typically a character, in our example a pawn, which can

11
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.600
be a bipedal, quad, a vehicle, whatever kind of pawn you would like there.

12
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.120
The controller possesses that pawn and runs it around in the world.

13
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.680
So that's what we mean when we say input animation.

14
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.360
Linear animation is bringing in animation files into Unreal coming from some kind of

15
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.920
FBX exporter, which we'll talk about the FBX exporter in the next few slides.

16
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.440
But linear animation will be something that's come from your DCC app maybe, or some kind

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680
of live mocap data.

18
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.440
So you can also bring that in via Alembic, which is the raw data, frame by frame cache,

19
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.320
and apply it to the sequencer using a control rig or even keyframed directly inside the

20
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320
sequencer.

21
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.640
The last animation type will be Live Link, and this is a plugin that allows you to connect

22
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.840
a mocap suit, you can connect it to Maya or maybe some other 3D application, and you can

23
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840
drive animations live inside of Unreal Engine.

24
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.460
So by having one-to-one information from your, through your Live Link plugin, maybe it's

25
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.860
using a mocap suit and you can see the performance happening live inside of Unreal Engine.

26
00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.860
You can then use a take recorder to record all this input and export it to its own animation,

27
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.920
which you can then use in sequencer or you can play over the top layer in animation.

28
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.220
You can do a whole bunch of things with this information once you've got it inside the

29
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220
engine.

30
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.140
But the main tool being here that you can see one-to-one feedback from the input, whether

31
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.780
it be a mocap suit or Maya or any kind of 3D application like this directly inside of

32
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.780
Unreal Engine.

33
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.060
So the type of animation sequences you can get, you can either have in-place or game-driven

34
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.380
motion and these are great for the input animations that we were referring to before.

35
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.340
These animations are in place, they're just on the spot animations, and then the animation

36
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.300
blueprint will push them around with the capsule based on player input and that's all handled

37
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.780
through code.

38
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.100
So the root bone wouldn't move in this instance.

39
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.380
If you want a more animation driven approach, it goes some place or root motion is what

40
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.140
we refer to here, which is intended for a sequence to drive it.

41
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.700
So we would maybe add keyframes in sequencer or do some other kind of action inside of

42
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.100
sequencer to push the character around.

43
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.740
If you enable root motion option, it will force the capsule to move according to the

44
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.140
root motion of the animation and animations need to have root bones for that to work.

45
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.900
So if you're using a Mixamo, AnimSkeleton or it's in the wrong place, you just need

46
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.980
to make sure you have a root bone with that option for it to work with the enable root

47
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.980
motion option.
