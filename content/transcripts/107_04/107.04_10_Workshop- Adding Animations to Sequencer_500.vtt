00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
The easiest way to explain how animations work inside a sequencer is we'll just add

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.720
an animation track inside using the mannequin that we were referencing before.

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.040
If you don't know where that is, you can follow this hierarchy down here.

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.680
You can also filter out skeletal meshes.

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.800
So if you click this button and click skeletal mesh, it'll give you all the skeletal meshes

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.600
that are available inside the content folder, which are this series of skeletal meshes here.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.160
So let's first of all create a level sequence.

8
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.960
So you can do this a couple of different ways.

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.960
In my content folder, I'm going to right click, New Folder, and just call this SEQ for Sequencer.

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.880
I'm going to untick, make sure if you tick the skeletal mesh filter, make sure you untick

11
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.400
that, otherwise you won't be able to see any sequencer files.

12
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.960
I'm going to right click, Animation, and then go to Level Sequence.

13
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.240
So right click in this grey box, Animation and Level Sequence.

14
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.200
I'm just going to call this SEQ underscore Manny Walk.

15
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.120
Manny is the name of the skeletal mesh that we have.

16
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.120
You can also create sequences through this button at the top for quick access.

17
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.640
I just like to create them through the content browser so I know exactly where they're being

18
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
saved and stored.

19
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.120
And then I'm just going to double click the sequencer.

20
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.200
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to pin it to my tab up here.

21
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000
Don't worry if you don't have this Merge Axis window, I'm going to close that.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.400
It's up to you what windows you have open and the kind of organisation of your workspace

23
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
here.

24
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.760
And so we've got a sequencer.

25
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.560
We've not got any information in the sequencer.

26
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.560
So the first thing I want to do now is back into my content browser.

27
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.280
I want to make sure the content is selected, skeletal mesh and I will find my mannequin

28
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280
character.

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
I will drag my mannequin into position here.

30
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.800
I will use spacebar to toggle through the different widgets to manipulate the mannequin

31
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
into place.

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.680
So just by tapping spacebar we go through location, rotation and scale.

33
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.680
I've got the mannequin roughly into position here.

34
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.680
I'll go back into my sequencer window and I will, with my mannequin selected, I will

35
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
right click, Active to Sequence, Add SK Mannequin.

36
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.760
So if I deselect mannequin, deselects the mannequin in the editor.

37
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.760
If I select mannequin, it selects the mannequin in the editor.

38
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.920
So we've got a one to one relationship with the mannequin.

39
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.360
So just make sure you have that.

40
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.200
If not, make sure you add that track again by selecting the mannequin, right click, Active

41
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.040
to Sequence and add the mannequin there.

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.440
So the first thing we'll do is we'll add a transform here.

43
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.260
So we'll add a new key under the transform.

44
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.600
So just select this little circle option here on 000.

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.880
I'm going to drag along this dark bar along the top.

46
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.640
I'm going to drag right to the end and I'll put my timeline around 148 units.

47
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.600
I'll use my mouse to navigate the scene.

48
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000
So again, right mouse button pans around, left mouse button to back and forwards, both

49
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.920
mouse buttons to move around.

50
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.280
So somewhere around this end point, I'm going to move the mannequin into position.

51
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.520
I'll drag them up here and I will add another key here.

52
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:38.240
Now if I press this button to front here and I press play, the mannequin will move over

53
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.720
the duration over that amount of units.

54
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.880
So make sure that you don't need to delete this key but I'm just going to click the

55
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.520
key and press delete on my keyboard.

56
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.200
Make sure you don't have this first key selected, then move the mannequin and then try and set

57
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.280
the key later down the timeline because the mannequin will snap back to the original position.

58
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.680
So you need to make sure you go to the time that you want, move then the actor that you

59
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.240
want to bind the key to and then add the key.

60
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.120
And then if I press rewind here to front and then press play, we got that movement.

61
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.540
Now you can just add whatever kind of additional movement you want.

62
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.280
Maybe I'm going to, around this point, I'm going to drag the mannequin up a little bit

63
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.600
in a perfect, very precise manner.

64
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.720
Not really.

65
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.360
I will maybe go here, maybe at this key here.

66
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.680
Oh classic example of me not moving the mannequin correctly.

67
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:58.000
There we go, add key and then maybe, maybe I'll rotate this just to see that and there

68
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
we go.

69
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.440
A very imprecise, precise movement of mannequin going up the little ramp here.

70
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.360
So we've got some basic movement but the mannequin's not got any animation.

71
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.440
So let's go ahead and add some animation now.

72
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.440
So I'm just going to, again, to front button here.

73
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.600
I'm going to go to the animation tab and you might see a series of animations here, especially

74
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.980
if you've got multiple animations for the mannequin.

75
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.040
You might see walks and idols and different things like that.

76
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.160
I just have a jog available to me in this project.

77
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.720
So I'm just going to select the jog animation and you'll see that first of all the mannequin

78
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.480
has a little jog animation.

79
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.080
So we'll do that and what I can also do is because it runs out of space around frame

80
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.600
60, I can actually just drag this animation along here and it will continue to loop straight

81
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.100
through the duration of this.

82
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.540
Now because the mannequin is running, it's feeling a bit slow so you may just want to

83
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.420
end up bringing all these keys in anyway.

84
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.220
You may just want to do something like this and this and this and this and you may just

85
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.060
think that it looks way better like this just because it gives it more speed.

86
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.340
But completely up to you how you do your animations.

87
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.220
The other thing to note here is if you want to do a walk into an idol for example, I could

88
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.460
add another animation here.

89
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.780
So like on frame 60, I could go to animation and jog forward and I have these two jogs.

90
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.760
I can actually just drag and drop this forward run over the previous one and you'll see some

91
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.920
blending behavior going on here.

92
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.340
So especially if I had a walk animation into an idol animation, I could blend from the

93
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.220
walk into the idol over a series of frames, you know, however long you want that duration,

94
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.660
that crossfade to be and that would actually blend the animations quite nicely.

95
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.740
So there's quite a lot of tools just for a few button presses inside a sequence that

96
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.620
you can get access to.

97
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.980
We've just discussed the transform and animation track and just with those two alone, you can

98
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.340
create some quite complex animation sequences and you can even then like we said, render

99
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.380
them out to the take recorder if you so wished.

100
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.880
So what did we cover there?

101
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.940
So we added a track for a skeletal mesh.

102
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.220
We added some keyframes in the timeline and we chose the time that we wanted to make these

103
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.220
changes.

104
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.820
And in this example here, we've got an idol into a walk and then back into an idol just

105
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.580
with a few keyframes down.

106
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.580
And so it's completely up to you then the approach that you take when creating these

107
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.940
sequences.

108
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.820
So when you finish with your sequence, you can create a linked animation sequence if

109
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.820
you want.

110
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.220
You can bake out the animation as we said before, you can just bake this to its own

111
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.180
animation sequence now.

112
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.380
You can export your animations in the FBX if you want to use those somewhere outside

113
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.380
of Unreal.

114
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.620
And you can also edit with the FK control rig just to get some more fine tuning going

115
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.620
on if you wanted to.
