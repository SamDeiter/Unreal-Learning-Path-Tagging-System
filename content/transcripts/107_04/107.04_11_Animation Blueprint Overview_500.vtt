00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
As we start to wrap up this course, I wanted to give you an overview of the animation blueprint

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.320
functionality and also a quick pro tip as well for anyone using vehicles inside of Unreal.

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.660
So a really good pro tip is the rotation of tires, which we see requested quite a lot.

4
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
So we're not going to dig into how to create this example, but I just wanted to provide

5
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.000
an example tire rotation control rig setup because this will likely be very useful in

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
your project.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.480
You can dig apart, pick apart the different nodes and kind of recreate this setup.

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.720
But I just wanted to provide an example image in case that was useful to you.

9
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.400
And then when we're talking about the animation blueprint overview, we essentially have the

10
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.160
two different graphs.

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.640
So we have the event graph for logic.

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.720
The event graph will house a lot of the blueprint control and any kind of specific input content.

13
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.920
And then also the animation graph will be for the control and the flow of information.

14
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.200
So you may end up with kind of state machine functionality for the flow of information

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
there.

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.680
When we talk about the event graph, it's essentially a very similar to a blueprint event graph.

17
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.600
You have variables in here.

18
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280
So you may have the car movement speed variable, for example.

19
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.720
So the event graph will control variables and logic.

20
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.840
You know, if you're wanting to drive this vehicle around, you'd have a lot of the logic

21
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.560
there in the event graph.

22
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.100
So then we actually get this information and we send it through to the animation graph.

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.720
And so if you want any additional resources on the specific functionalities, it's definitely

24
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.560
worth checking out the documentation page on that for some additional resources there.
