00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
Next up, let's talk a little bit about the Skeletal Mesh Editor, and talking specifically

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.080
about Skinned Animated Mesh Pipeline.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.440
So the editor overview, you'll see some new icons, especially if you're familiar with

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.600
Unreal Engine 4 or previous versions.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.720
We got some new icons of how to toggle between each section here.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.120
And when we jump into a workshop demo in a second, you'll see each of these being used.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.880
So the first one, we've got the Skeleton, then we've got the Mesh next to it.

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.320
We've got Animations, Animation Blueprint, which we'll touch upon at the end, and then

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320
also the Physics.

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.080
So it's very easy to cycle through each of the editor windows from directly inside the

11
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.760
editor, which is a really nice feature of Unreal Engine 5.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.040
When we talk about the Skeletal Mesh Editor, all editors can be accessed with these editor

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
windows.

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.120
So in reference to the previous slide that we were just talking about, if you look at

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.960
the top right-hand side of the screen here, you can see the Skeletal Mesh Editor and

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.240
the Skeleton, and also the Blueprint and the Physics.

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.760
So we can directly hop into each one of these editors from those icons on the top right

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760
there.

19
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.840
So really, really nice.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.520
And the one that we're looking at right here is the Mesh Editor.

21
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.240
So we have a lot of settings pertaining to the mesh.

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.480
We got all the materials listed on the right-hand side, for example.

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.280
You can set your LODs from here, Morph Targets, and it can all be accessed from this one central

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.360
space.

25
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.280
When we're talking about the Skeleton Editor, in this window, you can see that the actual

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.160
Skeleton has all the bone names.

27
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.120
So in the bottom left-hand side here, we've got the bone names starting from the root.

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.040
You know, when we're talking about that hierarchy, before we see the hierarchy playing a part

29
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.320
and showing where each of the bones are and what they're doing.

30
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.800
So you can also add sockets, which we'll be doing in a second.

31
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.280
You can add virtual bones, change the preview mesh.

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.960
We can even preview animations in this window as well, which is a really nice feature.

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.920
So you can create different asset types and also manage the animation notify.

34
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.600
So an animation notify might be a certain car tire sound when it hits a certain animation

35
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.760
or something like this, and we can fire all the notifies and especially preview those

36
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.820
animations directly from this window.

37
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.120
So when creating a new asset, we have a few different options available to us.

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.400
We can create an animation asset, a new pose.

39
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.480
We can even record animations directly inside of Unreal, which is a really nice feature.

40
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.480
So say you're driving this car around and it's a movable vehicle, you can actually

41
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.360
record that session and have it as an animation, which is a really, really powerful feature.

42
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.480
We can access our animation blueprint as mentioned before, and we can also do composite and montages

43
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840
as well as the blend spaces and aim offsets.

44
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.080
So these are also available through the mesh editor, just as a quick note.

45
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.320
But yeah, whole host of tools here that are useful to kind of directly dive into from

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.080
this window.
