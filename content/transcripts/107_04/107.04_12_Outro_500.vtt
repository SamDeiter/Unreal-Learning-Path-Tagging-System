00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
So, I really hope this was a useful introduction to Unreal Engine animation states and controlling

2
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.520
animation inside of Unreal Engine and just the different opportunities you have, whether

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.520
you want to author animations outside of Unreal Engine and bring them in via the FBX importer.

4
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.360
Do you want to do a lot of the animation driven sequences inside of Unreal and really get

5
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.640
the most out of working in real time within your scenes and using the different tools

6
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.400
such as Control Rig to then manipulate the content to create the best output. Or maybe

7
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.120
you want a blend of the two and hopefully there's a lot of tools here for you to just

8
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.320
play around with, especially loading up the sequences and the blueprints just to get a

9
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.240
feel for how you interface the information and how the flow of information works. So,

10
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.000
I hope you found this useful and thank you for watching.
