  "text": " Now let's take a look at what is the Unreal Engine Live Link Plugin and how we can use it to transmit Maya animation data real-time into the engine. Live Link is a plugin that allows you to create a communication protocol between two software to communicate animation data in real-time, allowing you, for example, to rig and animate a character inside Maya and watch it perform live inside Unreal Engine for testing purposes or to record the performance inside the engine. Generally you must export the mesh or character via FBX to the engine to ensure that you have the same mesh or skeletal mesh on both sides of the link and then create the connection between them with Live Link. Here we have a flowchart of a typical Live Link pipeline. As you can see, Live Link plugin will connect more than one software to Unreal Engine using a unified message bus. It is like a common language between different softwares. Inside Unreal, depending on the type of connection, the plugin will assign what is called a source as the incoming connection, for example, when the information that is produced can vary depending on what we want to share, like in Maya or MotionBuilder. Or a subject, like in specialized software connections like the iOS Face App and the VChem, where the channels are pre-established and is more a fixed link. Depending on the software involved and the state of the plugin, the amount of information transmitted will vary, but for the most part, transformation information of the animation data is basic among them all. In the new Maya plugin, there is a little bit more information being transferred, including some camera and lights attributes and more of animation data. Inside Unreal Engine, there is a couple of predefined roles that make it easier to define the incoming connection. This allows the data to be more easily mapped to a target actor within the engine. Supported roles include camera, lights, character, transform, and basic roles for generic data. A Live Link Controller and a Live Link Skeletal Animation component can be added to an actor in order to drive its parameters. In this example, we have a CineCamera actor with a Live Link Controller component that allows us to move the camera. We can even manage to change the focal length of our Unreal camera from Maya. The Live Link Controller can control animation, however, it is recommended that the Live Link Skeletal Animation component be used for animation or best results. You can also use Blueprint function calls to access Live Link data. Below, the Evolute Live Link Frame function attempts to get a Live Link frame from a specified subject using a given role. In the case below, the subject Camera1 and the role of Camera is accessed, and depending on the role, we will have the most relevant and useful data out of a node. We will go now through the process of installing and using Live Link. There are a couple of ways of acquiring the UE4 Maya Live Link. We can get it from the real market under the Real Engine Free Content category, but recently there is a much better and easy way. Engineers at Autodesk has created a flavor of their own of the Maya Live Link, and it's now ready to be downloaded from the Autodesk App Store. This makes it so easy to download and install, not to mention to keep it updated with every new version. Simply download, install and enjoy. After install, we just have to start Maya and enable both Live Link plugins. Once they are both enabled, we will be able to open the real Live Link from File on Real Live Link menu. Once the real live window UI is open, we can simply start adding meshes or skeletal hierarchies. We still have not made a connection between Maya and Unreal. For that, we will have to jump into the Engine. Once we are at the Engine, we should check that we have the Live Link plugin enabled and restart the Engine if prompted. Now, a new Live Link Stream Manager will be available in the Unreal Top Window menu. Once active, we can add Maya as a source message bus. Once the connection is made, we can start streaming animation data from Maya to Unreal. As we stated before, it is convenient to have the same character or mesh in both sides. So for example, if we want to animate an Unreal character in Maya, all we need to do is to export it from Unreal as an FBX file, import it into Maya, and add its root bone as a streaming object. Back in the Engine, we can test the connection by opening the character in the Persona Editor. And in the Preview Scene settings, we can change the Preview Controller to Live Link Preview Controller and enable Camera Sync. Now we should be able to see any rotations of the bone from Maya right into the character in the Persona Editor viewport. To ensure that the results are real-time, we can disable a property in the Editor properties called Useless CPU when in background. All right, all right. Let's start with the Maya Live Link Plugin. Where to find it and how to install it. You could get the old version, the original version of the plugin for Maya. You can find it in the Marketplace. And to get to it, all you need to do is go to the free Epic Game Content. If you go search, tags, you can search for Maya. And if you click Enter, there it is. Here it is. Live Link for Maya Live Data Streaming. I got it installed on all my engine versions. So that's why I cannot install it anymore. But once you install it, it doesn't have any code or plugin for Unreal per se. It's just for Maya. So what you would do is you would go to your, whatever you have your engine installed. And if you go to the UE4.27, you open that up. You go to Engine. You go to Logins. And you go Marketplace. And there it is. Maya Live Link. And if you open it up and you go to Binaries, you're going to see that you have all the year version of Maya listed right here for you to go in and get the appropriate plugin for your Maya version. All right? But this is the thing. There is a new way of installing and working with Maya Live Link. And that is because if you go to the Autodesk App Store, we are going to find that if we search for Unreal Maya Live Link. There it is. This is Unreal Live Link for Autodesk. This is a flavor of the Unreal Live Link that the engineers at Autodesk take for their own and they expand it and now it's better and faster and it's much, much, it goes well ahead of what the Live Link from Epic does. All right? So it's as easy as registering in the Autodesk with your Autodesk account and you download it for free. All right. Now, once you download it, it is going to be like this. It's an MSI file and you just simply double click. And because I already have it installed, it's going to look like this. But in your case, it's going to be what you want to do. Install. You install it. It's going to be great. It will auto detect all the Maya versions that you have installed in your system and it will be installed for all of those versions and it's going to be working already. So the next thing is to go to Maya and be sure that it is enabled and working. So you're going to go Windows and down here in Settings and Preferences, you go to Plugin Manager and you're going to search for Live Link. There it is. So you need... It's one word. There it is. It's one word. So you're going to need both of these plugins on. And if you want it, you know, always you're going to auto load it. And that's it. You got it working. Okay? Let's start with something very easy, right? To start. We are going to take this character with Live Link to Unreal after we see the ART tool, right? So for now, we're going to take a box. That is going to be enough to know that this direct link is working. Okay? I have a box right here. And to start the UI for the Unreal Live Link, you need to go File and you go Unreal Live Link. If you don't see this here, something is wrong. You have not enabled the plugins or the plugins got some kind of trouble. But if everything is all right, you should be able to click here and these new windows with this pretty UI is going to appear. This is as simple as starting adding whatever you want to start moving inside Maya and you want to see real time moving inside Unreal. Right. So before we start adding the sources, we see here that it says no connection. So that means that we need to go to our Unreal project. Once we are here, we need to check also that we have the Live Link plugin enabled and working. For that, we're going to Settings, Plugins, and we're going to search for Live Link. And there it is. This is the only one that you need to be working. There are a lot of other type of Live Link plugins. But for the purpose of this class, this should be enough. If it's not enabled and you enable, surely you're going to be prompted to restart your engine and you should. You restart, you should be able to. If you go up here, there is the Windows menu and there should be this new Live Link. This is what is called the Streaming Manager tab. If we turn it on, it's going to be anywhere. You can dock it wherever you want. I think here is all right. Now, all you need to do, once you have in Maya, this Unreal Live Link window open, it needs to be open. You're going to come back here and it's as easy as adding a new source. You go to Messages, Message, Plus Source, and there should be. There it is. It's the Live Link for the Maya. Now this is here and it says that the only thing that is active is the camera. That is because this version of Unreal, this version of the plugin will have a sync camera. So however you move your camera inside Maya, it's going to move in the viewport in Unreal. So this is always active. But now we want to start adding our own Meshes and Actors to move around. So we're going back to Maya and we're going to add this cube. So with the cube selected, I'm going to Add Selection. That's it. Now you can see that it says here that it's connected. That means that now I can come here and create a cube, an empty cube. I'm going to set it right here. It doesn't matter because it's going to jump to the position in Maya as soon as I get it connected. To get it connected, I need to add a new component to this cube and that component is going to be the Live Link Controller. There it is. And now it's asking me for what type of subject it is representing and I want to add the cube. That's it. This cube is static and you need to set it to Movable for it to work correctly. Now that this is here, we can come here to Maya. You should see that if I move around, there it is. I have Unreal connected with Maya. There it is. Let me close this. Let me close this. We have enough real estate. Now you can see that if I move, there it is. There's always the issue of how did you develop your scene? This scene might not be oriented the same in Unreal. Let me check. Now it is. There it is. Now we have a cube that you can animate. I could set a key and I can animate and set a key here and then I could take this and set a key right there. Now I can go back and play the animation and we have an animation playing inside Maya and it's running inside Unreal. So this is how you set Live Link for Maya and connect it to Unreal.",
