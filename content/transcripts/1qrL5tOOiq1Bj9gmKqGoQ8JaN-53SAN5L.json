  "text": " And to close out this course, let's add a basic rotator to your car so you can see it rotating inside of the engine. There are multiple ways that you could do this, but there is something called a rotating component inside of Unreal. So that's the approach that we'll take for now. So we want to select the car in the editor. We'll go to the details panel. We'll add a component. So in the outliner, we've selected the car. We go to add. We'll search for rotating movement and then we'll set the Z value to 15 and then we'll just hit play and it'll show it rotating. Now if you want the field of view changing, you can set that to 55. But let's jump in. Let's add a rotating component and see how that looks. I'm going to select my Audi. I'm going to go to add and I'll say rotating movement and I'll click that. This one already has a rotating movement set. So I've got this here. And then previously I showed only modified property so I just want to turn that off. And on the rotating movement, the rotation rate here we've set to 15. So you could go ahead and add that. Set that to 15. Now the field of view as well. If you wanted to drop these three lines here and the field of view, you could set the field of view to 55 if you want. Completely optional. However you'd like the field of view to look. All you really need to do is hit play and see the vehicle moving. So again that rotation rate is based on how fast you want the car to move. So it might be that you set the rotation rate. If we select the Audi in the outlining here, we go to rotation rate. It might be that you want a slower moving car for example. So I could set it to 5. Probably wouldn't want to go any higher than 15 because it might look unrealistic. But again, how do you want the actor to rotate? That's completely up to you. But hopefully that's a nice explanation and demonstration of how you're composing these scenes and adding lighting and then adding some of these finishing touches such as rotating and post-process. And I just want to go over a few useful links for you now. That's how a scene might look if you're dialing in the lights and adding these different tones and just experimenting with the lighting. So that's just an example shot of what you might be able to achieve with that setup. And then some additional resources. So the person that wrote this course is Ryan Manning and they've presented a few different links here that would be useful for you to continue this journey and exploration in setting up these scenes and working with the content inside of Unreal Engine. So hope you found that useful and thanks for watching.",
