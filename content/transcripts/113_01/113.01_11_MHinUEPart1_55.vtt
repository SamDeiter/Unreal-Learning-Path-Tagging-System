00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this section of our course, we will go over how to bring a metahuman into Unreal Engine

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and go over some best practices for working with them in your project.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let us begin by going over the download options and how to export a metahuman from Quixel Bridge

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in order to add it to our Unreal Engine project.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In Unreal Engine with Quixel Bridge open, the first thing you will need to do is download your metahuman.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
With the metahuman you wish to add to your project selected, select the quality you want to download.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In earlier versions of Unreal Engine 5.4, the options that were available were based on texture resolution quality.

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We now have the option to select cinematic, which gives us full resolution textures with separate materials,

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
LODs focused on quality over performance, the highest fidelity animation blending, along with body and neck correctives enabled.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This also gives us full strand based hair on LOD 0 and the average file size will range between 2-3 GB.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For the high, medium and low optimized options, we will have compressed textures and optimized materials

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with less instructions and baked textures, the LODs have been adjusted to improve performance,

13
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the settings that enable and disable correctives are based on LOD for more optimized animations.

14
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We also have optimized hair grooms and the average file size is under 100 MB.

15
00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Once you have selected the quality you wish to download, it will take some time to process before you can download and export them to Unreal Engine.

16
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If you wish to update a revised metahuman from the creator, Quixel Bridge will display an update button.

17
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
By updating this asset in Quixel Bridge, this does not mean the asset in the Unreal Engine project is updated.

18
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You will need to re-download and re-export the metahuman to Unreal Engine.

19
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Before you do so, as the asset will be overwritten, make sure to close all levels and sequences using the older version.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Then add it back into the project, save and restart.

21
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Once the download of your metahuman has completed, on the bottom right of your selected metahuman in Quixel Bridge,

22
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you can now click Add to export the metahuman.

23
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Inside of your project, you will see a metahuman's folder, and inside of that folder,

24
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
navigate to the folder with the name of the metahuman that was added, and double click on the blueprint to open it up.

25
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Once you do so, pop-up prompts will appear for missing plugins and project settings in the lower right corner.

26
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It is required that these are enabled, so click on Enable Missing on each, and then restart the engine.

27
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Once you restart the project, you can start working with your metahuman.

28
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Our course already has all of the required plugins and project settings enabled.

29
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Now, let's jump into Unreal Engine and start working with our metahuman.

30
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Inside of Unreal Engine, let's begin by going to the metahuman's folder.

31
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Inside of this folder is where you will find the metahuman you have exported from Bridge.

32
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Let's open up the folder named Lena underscore CQ.

33
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I've added CQ to reference that this was downloaded with the cinematic quality settings.

34
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Over here, we can see Lena's blueprint.

35
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Let's double click on this to open it.

36
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Inside of the metahuman blueprint, you will see it has an event graph, a construction script, and a viewport.

37
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this is where we can see our metahuman components brought together.

38
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Let's bring this closer to view.

39
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
On the left side, we can see all of the components that make up a metahuman.

40
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You will notice that when you select a component, in the Details panel on the right,

41
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the options that are unique to that asset will be displayed.

42
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We can modify each component's properties, and once finished making adjustments,

43
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
you can go here to compile and save those changes.

44
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now, let's return to our main viewport.

45
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
To add a metahuman to a level, simply drag and drop the metahuman blueprint in here.

46
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
In the Details panel on the right, go to the Transform to zero out its position.

47
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm going to delete this because we already have a metahuman in the level.

48
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now, if we select this metahuman in the Details panel on the right, all of the components will be visible.

49
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You can select each component and have the option to adjust things such as what you want to set the LOD to in the level.

50
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
For some assets such as the skeletal meshes, it may be best to adjust those inside of the blueprint.

51
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now, before we move on, let's review what we've just covered.

52
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We have just taken a look inside of the metahuman blueprint.

53
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Metahumans are made up of several components, and when selecting a component,

54
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the options that are unique to that asset will appear in the Details panel.

55
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We can modify components and their properties, and once finished making adjustments, we can compile and save those changes.

56
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
To add a metahuman to a level, drag the blueprint into the level.

57
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
When you select a metahuman in a level, all of the components and their options will be accessible in the Details panel,

58
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and you can make adjustments to each component from there.

59
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Now, let's return to Unreal Engine and go over how we can apply animations.

60
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Metahumans come with built-in body and face control rigs, and we can use these to create animations.

61
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
To do this, we will first create a level sequence.

62
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We can go up here and select Add Level Sequence.

63
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I will save this in our Course Topics folder, and now you can add a metahuman to Sequencer,

64
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
either by going to the Outliner, selecting it and dragging it in here,

65
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or we can go here on the left, select the Add button, and then go here to Actor to Sequence, and select it from here.

66
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
By default, the body and face control rig will appear.

67
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Let's go to Perspective and select Cam01Body in order to view it better.

68
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
If we look at the body controls, we can move some of these controls by rotating each individual joint.

69
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I will change the gizmo to Rotate, and I have already disabled snapping.

70
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000
For controls that allow you to only rotate individual joints, this is called Forward Kinematics or FK.

71
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I will change the gizmo to Translate, and I have already disabled snapping.

72
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If I select the foot control over here, I can move a hierarchy of joints, and this is called Inverse Kinematics or IK.

73
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
By default, the arms are set to FK and the legs are set to IK.

74
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:48.000
If we go into Sequencer and scroll up, and then go to the Global Control Track, here, this is where you can switch controls from FK and IK.

75
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Now, let's take a look at the face control rig.

76
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I'm going to scroll up here and collapse the body control rig.

77
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Let's go to Perspective and select the camera labeled Cam02Face, which will make it easier to see all of the face controls.

78
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
There are over 200 controls for the face.

79
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In order to move and adjust them, make sure the gizmo is set to Translate and it's set to Local Space, and also ensure that snapping is disabled.

80
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Now, we can click on a control and use the slider to move it.

81
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:46.000
If you want to select multiple controls at the same time, select the first control and then hold down Shift and select Additional Controls.

82
00:09:46.000 --> 00:10:01.000
To create a key, press the letter S, or you can create a key in the Animation Details panel over here on the right, or in Sequencer over here.

83
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Let's move a few frames over and now move these controls and press the letter S to set a key.

84
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
If I script through this, we can see we just created an animation.

85
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Now, let's see how to go about exporting this as an animation sequence.

86
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I'm going to scroll up to the top and collapse the face control rig board.

87
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm going to select the component for the face and right-click, and then select Bake to Animation Sequence.

88
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You will be prompted to name your animation and direct it to a folder, and once you do so, it will export this as an animation sequence.

89
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Now, before we continue, let's do a quick review of the steps we just completed.

90
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000
To access the body and face control rig, add the metahuman to Sequencer, and by default, the body and face control rigs will appear.

91
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The body control rig uses both FK and IK for moving controls.

92
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
FK stands for Forward Kinematics, which allow you to rotate individual joints.

93
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
IK stands for Inverse Kinematics, and allows you to move a hierarchy of joints.

94
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
To use the face control rig, select controls with the gizmo set to Translate in local space.

95
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
To create an animation with control rig, select the controls you wish to adjust and set keys for them by pressing the letter S,

96
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
or set keys in the Animation Details panel or inside of Sequencer.

97
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000
To export an animation from Sequencer that has been created with control rig, right-click on the face or body component track in Sequencer,

98
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and select Bake to Animation Sequence.

99
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
The control rigs are helpful in that they allow you to quickly pose and animate your metahuman.

100
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now, let's jump back into Unreal Engine and take a look at how we can apply existing body and facial animations to a metahuman.

101
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:24.000
In order to apply existing animations to a metahuman in Sequencer, begin by selecting the face control rig and the body control rig,

102
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and then deleting them.

103
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:37.000
For the animations that we will apply, I am going to go over here and change the track length of the sequence to 600 frames.

104
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I will use the N bracket down here to expand the sequence length and then go to the start of the sequence.

105
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Let's apply an animation to the body first.

106
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.000
On the body track, go to the plus sign, then go to Animation in order to add an animation track.

107
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Search for mh underscore sample body and select it.

108
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now, this is a body animation from the Sample Metahumans project.

109
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We now have an animation applied to the body.

110
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Let's repeat this for the face.

111
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Go to the plus sign, then to Animation and search for mh sample face and then select it.

112
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Let's go to Perspective and select cam3 face.

113
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
If we play the sequence, we can now see our metahuman come to life.

114
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And this is how you apply existing animations to the metahuman face and body in Sequencer.

115
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Now there may be instances where perhaps you want to adjust an existing animation.

116
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
To do this, you can bake the animation to control rig.

117
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Select the body or face component whose animation you wish to adjust.

118
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Then right click on the component and then go here and select Bake to control rig.

119
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
For the body, you would select metahuman control rig.

120
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Now before we move on, let's review the steps we just completed.

121
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We have just looked at how we can apply an existing animation sequence to a metahuman in Sequencer.

122
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Begin by deleting the default control rig tracks, then use the plus sign on the body or face component to add an animation track.

123
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:58.000
If you want to adjust an existing animation, you can bake that animation to the control rig by right clicking on the face or body component

124
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and selecting Bake to control rig.

125
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
All metahumans are performance capture ready using LiveLink, LiveLink face, metahuman animator and more.

126
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We've only scratched the surface with what is possible with metahumans.

127
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And we delve much deeper into the topics we have covered with the metahuman blueprints and animation course.

128
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Now let's wrap up this introductory course with some final recommendations.

129
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Thank you for watching.
