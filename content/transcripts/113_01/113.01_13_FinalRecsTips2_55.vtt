00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This brings us to the final section of our course.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's wrap things up by going over a few tips and resources you may find helpful when working with metahumans in your project.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We will jump back into Unreal Engine to go over some of these.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
One thing you may encounter when working with a metahuman in your scene is you may accidentally select one of the components instead of the actual blueprint.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One way to prevent this and to also move your metahuman around in your scene with ease is to use an actor.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Go to the Get Content panel, then go to Basic and select Actor.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In the Details panel, with the actor selected, reset the transform settings to zero for the actor,

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and ensure the position of the metahuman in the level has also been zeroed out.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, in the Outliner, drag the metahuman blueprint over the actor to make it a child of the actor.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And now, you can use the actor to move the metahuman around in the scene.

11
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This will also prevent the metahuman from reverting back to its default pose and position when moving it around when it has an animation applied to it.

12
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, before we move on, let's review the steps we just completed.

13
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We have looked at how we can use an actor to move our metahuman around in our level.

14
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
To add an actor to the level, go to the Get Content panel, then go to Basic and select Actor.

15
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Zero out the position of both the actor and metahuman, and in the Outliner, drag the metahuman blueprint over the actor to make it a child of the actor.

16
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, let's continue by jumping back into Unreal Engine.

17
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There may be cases where you have been using a metahuman as a placeholder to block out a scene and are now ready to bring in your final version,

18
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or you simply want to replace it with a different metahuman.

19
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
A simple way to do this is to add the metahuman you wish to use in the level.

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Then, in the Outliner, select the metahuman you want to replace.

21
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Right-click on it and select Replace Actors With, and then select the metahuman blueprint you want in its place.

22
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And now, we can delete this one and continue working.

23
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Let's review the steps we just completed.

24
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If you want to replace an existing metahuman in a scene with a new one, add the metahuman you want to replace the existing one with into the level.

25
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In the Outliner, select the metahuman you want to replace.

26
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Right-click on it, select Replace Actor With, and then select the metahuman you want to replace it with.

27
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Now, let's go over a few other things worth mentioning when working with metahumans.

28
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
When working with metahumans, at some point you may be considering changing engine versions.

29
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Determine which engine version you will be using as that will define available feature sets for your metahuman.

30
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.000
If you decide to upgrade metahumans in a project, just note that there will be a series of steps you will need to go through to ensure you have successfully updated them.

31
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Metahumans can only be upgraded as previous versions have several variations in skeletal joint systems or blueprint setups that prevent downgrading.

32
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We saw with our hands-on exercise how we can use the metahuman plugin and the mesh-to-metahuman workflow to generate a metahuman identity from a 3D model to achieve likeness with our character.

33
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You can also generate a metahuman identity from footage using depth footage from an iPhone or vertical stereo head-mounted camera.

34
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The template mesh workflow, also referred to as conformed mesh, solves a metahuman identity using the mesh-to-metahuman workflow based on geometry.

35
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The only requirement is that the 3D mesh uses the same topology as a metahuman mesh.

36
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This workflow results in better fitting of geometry in joints.

37
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The DNA calibration tools allow you to go beyond the metahuman creator and the mesh-to-metahuman workflow in order to push likeness even further.

38
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We delve into these workflows in greater detail in the metahuman DNA calibration courses.

39
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
When integrating metahumans into your pipeline, keep in mind there will be a learning curve.

40
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
As mentioned at the start of this course, the metahuman framework is made up of a variety of collaborating parts.

41
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Having an understanding of each of these assets and how they work together seamlessly is vital to the learning process.

42
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This can help when making decisions on how to approach modifying the different assets, what and where to look if something is not working,

43
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and what changes have been made to feature sets as engine versions update.

44
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
With each new release of metahumans and feature sets, the end user license agreement may be updated or amended

45
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to reflect changes to the legal document that explains a user's rights and obligations related to the use of metahuman technology.

46
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
This can include the metahuman creator, the metahuman plugin for Unreal Engine, metahuman animator, and any other related Epic Games assets and technologies.

47
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:36.000
For Unreal Engine versions 5.5 and earlier, metahuman assets are licensed for use in Unreal Engine projects, meaning users must render metahumans with Unreal Engine.

48
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Be sure to read the full agreement carefully. You can locate your ULA history in your user account on the Unreal Engine website.

49
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Finally, all of the online resources and links to some of the tools discussed today can be found by following the URLs on this slide.

50
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference.

51
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This brings us to the end of the metahuman introduction course.

52
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I want to thank you for spending your time with me, and I hope that these videos help you as you continue working with metahumans in Unreal Engine.
