00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
In this section of our course, we will get started by learning about the MetaHuman framework

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.120
and MetaHuman sample projects.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.740
Let us begin with the question, what is a MetaHuman?

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.019
MetaHuman is an Epic Games product that democratizes the creation of engine-ready, high-quality

5
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.140
digital humans.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.359
MetaHuman Creator, released in 2021, is a cloud-based application, allowing users to

7
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.880
create fully rigged, high-fidelity digital characters that can be brought to life in

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.579
Unreal Engine easily.

9
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.960
This brings us to the next question, which is, what is the MetaHuman framework?

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.799
The MetaHuman framework is the culmination of decades worth of bleeding-edge research

11
00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:54.519
and collaborations with three-lateral and cubic motion, which are part of Epic Games.

12
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.640
MetaHuman, based in Serbia, specializes in creating digital humans using cutting-edge

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840
scan technology and rigging.

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.240
Cubic motion, based in the UK, and presently under the three-lateral banner, is focused

15
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.480
on performance-driven, facial animation solutions.

16
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.480
The MetaHuman Creator presets are derived from three-lateral's MetaHuman framework,

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.379
using their database from having scanned people's appearances and geometry.

18
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:30.579
The MetaHuman framework is made up of a variety of collaborating parts, and the assets include

19
00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:37.579
the body and head meshes, skeletons and control rigs, animation blueprints, materials and

20
00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.419
animated maps, clothing, grooms, MetaHuman DNA, and rig logic.

21
00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:49.939
A more in-depth look at the assets that make up the MetaHuman framework are covered in

22
00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.700
the MetaHuman blueprints and animation course, and the MetaHuman DNA calibration courses.

23
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.739
Now, that's it for this section.

24
00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:04.939
Next, we will take a look at a few MetaHuman sample projects worth exploring.
