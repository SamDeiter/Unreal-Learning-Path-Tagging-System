00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
Now, let's take a look at a few metahuman sample projects that are available for free

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.080
on FAP.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.320
With the release of Metahumans in 2021, the Metahuman sample project was made available.

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.039
This project includes a cinematic sequence with high quality body and facial animations.

5
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.560
I have included one of the face and body animations from here, located in the course project assets

6
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.159
folder inside the folder named Animations.

7
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:39.399
We also have the Metahumans lighting project released in 2022, and this includes lighting

8
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.759
presets made with the help of cinematographer Greg Frazier and three created for the Matrix

9
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:49.239
Awakens Unreal Engine 5 experience.

10
00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.099
I have included the maps from here in the course project assets folder inside the folder

11
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.899
named MH Lighting.

12
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.519
The game animation sample project released in 2024 showcases fully functional animation

13
00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:13.140
systems and includes hundreds of animations and retargetor setups for UEFN skeletons

14
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.180
to Metahumans.

15
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.340
We also have the UEFN Talisman demo, which allows users to explore the Olympic cloth

16
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.340
simulation and optimization of Metahumans for UEFN.

17
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.020
Two other projects worth mentioning are the City Sample Project from the Matrix Awakens

18
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.620
Unreal Engine 5 experience released in 2022 and the ML Deformer sample project, which

19
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.100
showcases Unreal Engine's machine learning technology to create deformations driven by

20
00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.659
muscle, flesh, and cloth simulation.

21
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.579
Both of these projects use characters from the Metahuman framework, although they are

22
00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.099
somewhat different from the standard ones downloaded from Quixel Bridge.

23
00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.539
Now, let's move on to the next section of this course where we begin our journey in

24
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.939
creating Metahumans using the Metahuman Creator.
