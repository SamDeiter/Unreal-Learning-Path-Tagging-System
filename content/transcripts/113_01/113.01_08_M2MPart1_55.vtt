00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this section, we will primarily work in Unreal Engine to create a metahuman from a face scan.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As we work through this exercise, you will note that this is broken down into a step-by-step process that is found in your slide deck.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
As we complete portions of the practical exercise, I will review the completed steps.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, let's jump into Unreal Engine and begin creating a metahuman.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
With Unreal Engine open, as mentioned at the beginning of the course,

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the RealityScanFaceScanAsset has already been imported and is located under the Assets folder in the folder named ScanMesh.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you wish to go through all of the steps I will show,

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you can locate the original OBJ file and textures that have been provided in the Source Files folder named 11301 RealityScanAsset.

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, I'm going to navigate to our Course Topics folder

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and in here, I'm going to create a new folder to work in by pressing Ctrl Shift N.

11
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I will name this EX for example and then open this up.

12
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Inside of here, we will get started by importing the 3D mesh.

13
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Start by going to the import over here,

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
then inside of the Source Files folder named 11301 RealityScanAsset,

15
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the RealityScan folder, select the FaceScanMesh and the textures and then select Open.

16
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The Import Content option will appear and if you are working with an asset that has separate meshes,

17
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
for instance the eyes and the head are separate, go to Static Meshes and enable Combine Static Meshes.

18
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then go here and select Import.

19
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Once the asset and textures are imported, open up the FaceMesh to inspect it.

20
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Make sure it is facing the X-axis.

21
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If it is not, you can re-import it and make the appropriate adjustments to the offset rotation in the import options.

22
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The next step is to prepare the mesh.

23
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now, let's create a new material in order to apply the textures to our 3D head mesh.

24
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Right click in the Content Browser and select Material.

25
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I will name this M underscore RC for RealityCapture and then open this up.

26
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Going back to the main viewport, I will undock the material so that I can add the textures to the material graph.

27
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And from here, I will select the Albedo and Normal map and drag these into the material graph.

28
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
You don't necessarily need the Normal map but since we have it, let's use it.

29
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Inside of this material, I will connect the Albedo to the Base Color and then connect the Normal map to the Normal.

30
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You may find it helpful to adjust the specular in the event your material is a bit shiny.

31
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I will press 1 to create a constant and set the value to something like 0.3 and then I will connect this to the specular.

32
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I will save this and go back to our main viewport.

33
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
With the new material selected, let's go to our Static Mesh window

34
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and apply this to our 3D head mesh by assigning it over here.

35
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now, before we move on, let's review some of the steps we just completed.

36
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
For the Mesh to MetaHuman workflow, begin by importing the 3D head mesh and textures.

37
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.000
If working with a 3D model that has separate meshes, in the Static Mesh section of the import options, check on Combine Meshes.

38
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Once imported, check to see that it is facing the X-axis, otherwise adjust the rotation offset in the import options and re-import it.

39
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:06.000
One note is that the import options will look different from previous versions of Unreal Engine 5.

40
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The next step is to prepare the mesh.

41
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Apply a material using an albedo texture.

42
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It is helpful to use an albedo map in order to separate the sclera from the skin tone.

43
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
With the material results, the 3D face model should have the eyes open with a visible seam separation of the eyelid and eye to assist with the tracking marker placement.

44
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The mouth should be closed and the face should have a relaxed neutral pose.

45
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Something to note is that if the model does not have eyeballs, the empty sockets may generate artifacts in the mesh fitting.

46
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now, let's jump back into Unreal Engine and continue with the next steps.

47
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The next step of this workflow is to create a metahuman identity asset.

48
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:10.000
There is an existing one you can inspect located in the course topics folder inside of the folder named Mesh to Metahuman Identity in the folder named Sample Metahuman ID.

49
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
This is already gone through the process of being generated using the 3D headscan data.

50
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Let's go back to the Mesh to Metahuman Identity folder and create a new folder to work in by pressing Ctrl Shift N and name this EX for example.

51
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Inside of here, right click in the content browser and select Metahuman Animator and then select Metahuman Identity.

52
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The name you give this will be the name that will appear in the Metahuman Creator later on.

53
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I will name this RC underscore scan.

54
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now, I will double click to open it.

55
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I'm going to dock it up here and once this window opens, you may be prompted with an Epic Games sign in.

56
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The next step is to populate the Metahuman Identity asset.

57
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Go to the main toolbar, go to create components and drop this down, select from Mesh

58
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and then search for the 3D mesh.

59
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I will type in RC underscore scan and then scroll down to locate it.

60
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Once it is selected, it may take a moment for it to load.

61
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Once loaded, navigate to the front of the face scan.

62
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
In the top left panel, select the body component.

63
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Right below, select the body type that you wish for this Metahuman to have.

64
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
In my case, I want to select the female medium normal body weight.

65
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, before we move on, let's review the steps we just completed.

66
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
After importing and preparing the face scan model, the next step is to create a Metahuman Identity asset.

67
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Right click in an empty space in the content browser, select Metahuman Animator and then Metahuman Identity.

68
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The name you choose will be a placeholder for it in the Metahuman Creator.

69
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Once you open up the Metahuman Identity asset, you may be prompted to sign in with your Epic Games account.

70
00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Inside of the Metahuman Identity asset window, the next step is to populate it with the 3D model and assign a body type.

71
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Go to the main toolbar, go to create components and drop it down.

72
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Select from mesh and then search for it.

73
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It will take a moment to load in the viewport.

74
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Next, select the body component and then select the body type you want your Metahuman to have.

75
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Now, that's it for this section.

76
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
In the next video, we continue our hands-on exercise with the next steps of the Mesh to Metahuman workflow.
