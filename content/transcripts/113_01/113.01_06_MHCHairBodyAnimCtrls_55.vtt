1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We just finished exploring the MetaHuman Creator face controls.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Next, we continue our journey with the MetaHuman Creator by looking at the hair controls.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, let's jump back into the MetaHuman Creator.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, let's take a look at the hair controls.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If we select the head and go to Style,

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we can see a variety of hairstyles we can choose from.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For the hair color, you can choose from any of the presets,

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and you can also choose from neutral, deep, or vibrant colored presets.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And you can create your own custom color.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you want to further customize the hair, you can go to the Details tab.

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can adjust properties such as the roughness, salt and pepper, and salt and pepper lightness for the main color.

12
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Depending on the hairstyle you have selected, you will also have the option to enable ombre,

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which starts at the tip of the hair and spreads upward.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This has its own customizable properties, such as color, shift, contrast, and intensity.

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can enable the highlights, which controls the balance between dyed and natural hair strands.

16
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You can adjust the color, the color blending, the intensity, and variation.

17
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Just as we have hairstyles we can choose from for the head,

18
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we also have some options we can choose from for the eyebrows and eyelashes.

19
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For the eyebrows, we can select any style we want,

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and adjust the color and the details for these independently from the head.

21
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Depending on the brow style you choose, some may have in the Details panel

22
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the option for shading and microblading.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Moving on to the eyelashes, having options for the eyelashes can be helpful,

24
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
especially when working with more custom metahumans.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
For instance, your character may have a unique eye shape,

26
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and you might prefer the lash placement of one style over the other.

27
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The eyelash color can also be customized and has its own color details.

28
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I will go here to turn off the toggle clay material.

29
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
For the mustache and beard options, these also have their own styles,

30
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and there are a variety of mustaches and beards you can choose from.

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now depending on which style you select for either of these,

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
some will also have the color options such as ombre and highlights.

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Before we move on to the body controls, let's do a quick review of the hair controls.

34
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
For the hair controls, we have a variety of styles and colors we can choose from

35
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for the head, the eyebrows, the eyelashes, the mustache and the beard.

36
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
When you select a color for the hairstyle, that color is applied to all the other grooms.

37
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You can change the color of the other grooms independently.

38
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now depending on the style you have chosen, you will also have a few other options

39
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
you can configure such as ombre and highlights.

40
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Depending on the eyebrow style you have selected, some may have the additional option

41
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to choose microblade and makeup shading.

42
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now that we've looked at the hair controls, let's continue by exploring the body controls.

43
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now let's take a look at the body controls that allow us to customize the proportions

44
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and add contemporary clothing such as tops, bottoms and shoes.

45
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Starting with the proportions, we have 18 unique body shapes we can choose from

46
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
based on height and these are short, average and tall.

47
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Now we can choose whether we want to have a feminine or masculine body type

48
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and we can choose if we want our character to be underweight, overweight or normal.

49
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000
There is also a head scale slider over here if we wish to adjust the head size in relation to the body.

50
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
For the clothes, starting with the tops, these contemporary styles also come with a wide variety of patterns.

51
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
These patterns can be applied and further customized.

52
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
If we wish to remove the clothing, we can select this option over here.

53
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
For the pants, we will also have a few contemporary styles.

54
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Some of these options will also allow you to select from a variety of patterns.

55
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If we wish to remove the pants, we can select this option.

56
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Lastly, we have a few different styles of shoes.

57
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
There are no patterns or additional detail options for the shoes other than the color options that are available here.

58
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now before we move on to the animation toolbar, let's review the body controls one more time.

59
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
For the body controls, we can choose the proportions based on height, feminine or masculine and body weight.

60
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
A quick note is that the female medium normal body weight metahuman will always be the metahuman based skeleton.

61
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
For clothes, it is worth mentioning that they are contemporary.

62
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So if you are looking for something different, there are several options for metahuman custom clothing on Fab.

63
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Now let's move on and take a look at the animation toolbar.

64
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
If you want to see what your character looks like with all of the customizations you have applied,

65
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you can use the animation toolbar to apply a variety of body and face animations.

66
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Starting with the face, if we click on the vertical ellipsis and select a facial pose over here,

67
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
we can see what our character looks like when making certain expressions.

68
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We can also select the facial rom animation and see a variety of expressions on our metahuman.

69
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is especially useful when testing out changes you have made to the face, such as wanting more prominent wrinkle maps.

70
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This is also very helpful in spotting problematic areas while working with more customized metahumans,

71
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
as you can identify those and make changes on the spot before bringing it into the engine.

72
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You can also choose from a variety of body poses or animations,

73
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and this is helpful if you want to see what the body proportion you have chosen looks like when your character is in a certain pose.

74
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The body rom is especially useful if we want to see what our character looks like in motion, perhaps with a specific clothing style.

75
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
The animation toolbar can help you make decisions on the spot based on how your character looks when the face and body come to life.

76
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We can also use this to see what our customizations look like with a variety of lighting scenarios and camera positions.

77
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Let's do a quick review of the animation toolbar before we move on to a few other things we can do with the metahuman creator.

78
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We have just looked at the animation toolbar, which includes a number of body and facial animations and poses that we can apply.

79
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The face animations are particularly helpful as you can see with the wrinkle maps and adjustments to the face look like in the event you want to change something before bringing it into Unreal Engine.

80
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Some of the facial animation poses we can access inside of our Unreal Engine project in the metahumans folder located in the face pose library folder.

81
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The body animations can be helpful if you want to see what different proportions and clothing options might look like when your metahuman is in motion.

82
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We have just seen what is possible inside of the metahuman creator by simply selecting a metahuman preset and using the various tools to further customize it.

83
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
There may be times where you might want to share a metahuman you have created with another user.

84
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So let's jump back into the metahuman creator one more time to go over the process of how we can share metahumans with other users.

85
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Inside of the metahuman gallery, let's go over how we can share metahumans with others from here.

86
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
With the metahuman we wish to share with someone selected, we can go to the bottom left panel over here.

87
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
In this panel, we will have the option to permanently delete a metahuman or create a duplicate.

88
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And over here we have an option to import an mhb file and export an mhb file.

89
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
If you select export, a progress bar will appear and a copy of your metahuman will be downloaded as an mhb file.

90
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000
If you want to import an mhb file someone has shared with you, you can click on the import option and choose the mhb file.

91
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And that metahuman will appear in your My Metahumans gallery.

92
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Alright, let's review everything we've just covered before we move on.

93
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We have just seen how we can export and import metahuman creator files in order to share our metahuman characters with other users.

94
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It can be helpful to share and receive metahuman creator mhb files so that you can work with other users on the same character.

95
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
If you wish to share a metahuman with someone, in the My Metahumans gallery, use the panel below to select export.

96
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The mhb file will be downloaded and you can share that file.

97
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
If you want to import an mhb file someone has shared with you, you can select import then locate the mhb file.

98
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
A progress bar will appear and that metahuman will appear in your My Metahumans gallery.

99
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:37.000
We have explored what we can achieve inside of the metahuman creator, but there may be cases where you want to push for more likeness with your character.

100
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So this brings us to the next section of this course where we go beyond the metahuman creator and use the metahuman plugin for Unreal Engine to create a character from an existing 3D mesh with the mesh to metahuman workflow.

101
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Thank you for watching.
