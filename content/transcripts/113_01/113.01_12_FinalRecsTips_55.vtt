MetaHumans provide a digital human pipeline that can fit into any workflow.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.879
Let's take a look at vertical specific applications they can easily be integrated into.

6
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:36.479
In architectural visualization, MetaHumans can be used to add life to an environment

7
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.600
and create a sense of scale.

8
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.920
In automotive product design, they can add a human touch to a digital product and can

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.280
even be used for digital car showroom presentations.

10
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.039
In film and television, they can be used as digital doubles of real world actors performing

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.920
in a digital world.

12
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.439
They can also be used to pre-visualize performances with real-time animation workflows.
