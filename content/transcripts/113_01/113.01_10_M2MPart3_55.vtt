00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
Let's wrap up our hands-on exercise with the final steps of the Mesh to Metahuman workflow.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.640
So let's dive back into Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.719
After running the Metahuman Identity Solve, if the tracking markers still need to be adjusted,

4
00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:26.080
or you wish to add additional markers to refine certain areas, such as the eyes and ears,

5
00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.399
you can now enable additional tracking markers.

6
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:38.039
In the top right over here, we can see additional tracking options that we can enable.

7
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.200
Some tracking curves may already be set to visible, and others may be disabled.

8
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.759
If you hover your mouse over the icon next to the tracker name, an image of what portion

9
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:58.640
of the face that tracker is assigned to will appear, which can be helpful.

10
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.140
If for example we want to add tracking markers to the left and right eye crease, we can go

11
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.200
here to make the left eye crease visible, then select this to enable the curve to be

12
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.680
used for the solve.

13
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.319
Let's repeat these steps for the other eye crease.

14
00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.719
Now go to the tracking markers of the right eye to start adjusting the eye crease tracking

15
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.959
marker positions.

16
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:38.599
I'm going to select this tracking curve and move it over the eye crease, and then I will

17
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:47.079
start to reposition each individual tracking marker.

18
00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:55.239
Moving over to the left eye, I'm going to move the tracking curve, but this time I will

19
00:01:55.239 --> 00:02:13.000
deselect each tracking marker one by one.

20
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.199
Now if you wish to track the ears, we can add another frame by going here and clicking

21
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.319
on the plus sign.

22
00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.479
I'm going to rotate the camera so that we can see the left ear.

23
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:37.439
And now I will go to the top right over here, and I'm going to select the first ear and

24
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.520
drop this down.

25
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.520
I will change the visibility for each tracking curve, and this will automatically set these

26
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.680
tracking curves to active.

27
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.080
Just make sure with this frame selected, go to the neutral pose details panel on the

28
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.800
left over here, and in the frame promotion panel, uncheck used to solve for this additional

29
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.680
frame.

30
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.879
We do this so that only one frame is used for the identity solve.

31
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm going to delete this frame now.

32
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.040
Once you are finished adding additional tracking curves and adjusting their positions, go back

33
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.640
to the toolbar and run the metahuman identity solve again.

34
00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:34.319
You can keep running the metahuman identity solve and continue to adjust tracking marker

35
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.319
positions or adding new tracking curves until you are happy with the results.

36
00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.839
Use the viewport toolbar to continue to inspect your mesh.

37
00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:52.399
I can see when using the overlay option that the eye creases have assisted in getting a

38
00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:57.039
better solve and I am happy with the results.

39
00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:02.799
Once you have a ballpark approximation of what you want to achieve, the final step here

40
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.599
is to auto-rig the metahuman identity.

41
00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:14.239
Go to the main toolbar, then go to mesh to metahuman and drop this down.

42
00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.639
You can choose whether you want to auto-rig the skeletal mesh only, which will create

43
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.159
an auto-rigged version with the embedded DNA added to the Unreal Engine project, or you

44
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.040
can select skeletal mesh and full metahuman.

45
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.240
Once selected, you may be prompted to sign in with your Epic Games account.

46
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.400
This will generate a skeletal mesh with embedded DNA to the project and a full metahuman will

47
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.640
appear in the metahuman creator for further editing.

48
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.200
This process may take a few moments to complete.

49
00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.639
A pop-up will appear letting us know that a skeletal mesh with embedded DNA is now available

50
00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:09.839
in our content browser and a metahuman is also available in the metahuman creator.

51
00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:17.039
We can now leave this metahuman identity asset window and go back to our main viewport.

52
00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:23.680
I'm going to save everything and in the content browser, there will be the skeletal

53
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.400
mesh of the metahuman identity.

54
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.879
The final step of this workflow is to go to the metahuman creator and further customize

55
00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.560
our metahuman.

56
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.519
In the main viewport, go to the get content panel and select Quixel Bridge.

57
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:50.519
Go to the Quixel Bridge menu on the left and in the my metahumans option, you will be able

58
00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:56.439
to locate and select your newly created metahuman identity.

59
00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:01.959
With the metahuman identity selected, we can go here on the right to start the metahuman

60
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.199
creator.

61
00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.000
Now, as we wait for the metahuman creator browser to load, let's review the steps we

62
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.159
just completed.

63
00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:20.000
Once you have tracked a neutral pose and run the metahuman identity solve, additional markers

64
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.920
can be added.

65
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.160
In the top right window, you can see all of the tracking markers that are available.

66
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.199
Some of them by default will be visible and used for the initial metahuman identity solve.

67
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.680
If you hover over the icon located next to a curve, an image of what portion of the face

68
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.319
that tracker is assigned to will appear.

69
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.240
You can change a tracking curve to visible and also change it to active so that it is

70
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.519
used for the solve.

71
00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:54.959
Then you can continue rerunning the metahuman identity solve and adjusting or adding more

72
00:06:54.959 --> 00:07:02.359
tracking curves until you are happy with the results.

73
00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:07.019
The next step is to finalize your metahuman identity.

74
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:13.759
In the main toolbar, go to the mesh to metahuman dropdown and select auto rig metahuman identity

75
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:20.399
and full metahuman so that you can make further adjustments to it in the metahuman creator.

76
00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:26.519
When you run the auto rig and full metahuman option, a skeletal mesh and embedded DNA will

77
00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:32.480
be added to your project and a placeholder for your metahuman identity will become available

78
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.680
in the metahuman creator.

79
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.439
Now, let's wrap things up with the final steps of this workflow inside of the metahuman

80
00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:45.120
creator.

81
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.000
Now that the metahuman creator browser has loaded, we can see our metahuman in the My

82
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.600
Metahumans gallery.

83
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.920
With this already selected, I am going to go down here and select edit selected.

84
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.480
I am going to stop the animation and I want to toggle off the hotkeys.

85
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.480
In the properties and attributes, we can see the custom mesh panel has become available.

86
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.800
I want to change the camera view to focus on the face for this.

87
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.160
Now this is unique to metahumans created with the mesh to metahuman workflow.

88
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.860
This slider allows you to adjust the overall region influence which blends the delta in

89
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:36.279
volume between your input and a template metahuman.

90
00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:43.000
I will bring the face a bit closer.

91
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.799
Over here in this panel, you can select specific regions of the face and then move the slider

92
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:55.679
to increase or decrease the region influence for this specific area.

93
00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:01.620
This is especially helpful if you find problematic areas.

94
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:08.560
If I select the eyes for instance and start to move the slider, we can see how even though

95
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.779
the change is minor, this can be useful if your custom character's eyeballs and eyelid

96
00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.860
might be intersecting.

97
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.539
And you may find it helpful to use this on the mouth area to blend a bit of the template

98
00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:28.539
mesh in cases where perhaps the teeth and lips may be intersecting.

99
00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:34.939
In order to use the blend, sculpt and move tools, you can select enable editing.

100
00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:39.980
It might be helpful to select duplicate and unlock so that you always have a copy of the

101
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.740
original in the event you want to revert back to it.

102
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.019
Now before we start making any modifications, it may be helpful to view your character with

103
00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:55.980
skin textures applied by going to the skin control.

104
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.100
Select assign skin color to apply a skin texture.

105
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.860
You will notice that the template mesh texture is assigned as the texture we used previously

106
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.060
will not transfer over.

107
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:17.420
Now you can see your newly created metahuman character come to life by using the animation

108
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:24.420
toolbar and continue inspecting and refining your character.

109
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:29.819
Now that we have gone over some of the options inside of the metahuman creator that are unique

110
00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:35.459
to the mesh to metahuman workflow, let's wrap up this section of our course by reviewing

111
00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:41.399
the steps we just completed.

112
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:47.620
The last step of the mesh to metahuman workflow is to inspect the metahuman identity inside

113
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.980
of the metahuman creator.

114
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.820
An option that is unique to this workflow is the region influence which allows you to

115
00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:01.779
blend either the entire face of your input with the template metahuman or to adjust the

116
00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:05.659
region influence for specific areas of the face.

117
00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:11.740
This option is especially helpful if you have problematic areas such as the eyes and eyelids

118
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.899
intersecting or to adjust certain areas of the mouth.

119
00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:21.899
You can use the blend sculpt and move tools by enabling editing.

120
00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:26.860
You will be prompted to duplicate and unlock the metahuman so that you have a backup of

121
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:33.139
your original or to just use the original to make further adjustments.

122
00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:39.059
The original albedo texture associated with your 3D model will be replaced by the template

123
00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:45.299
mesh texture so you can assign a skin texture in the skin tab.

124
00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:51.219
You can apply animations to your metahuman using the animation toolbar and again this

125
00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:57.299
will be helpful in spotting problematic areas or to be able to view any customizations you

126
00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:01.620
make as you continue to refine your character.

127
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.859
And this brings us to the end of this section of our course.

128
00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:11.159
In the next section we will take a look at how to bring a metahuman into Unreal Engine

129
00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:17.279
and also go over some best practices for working with it in your project.
