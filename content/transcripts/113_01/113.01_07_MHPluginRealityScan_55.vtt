1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this section of our course, we will go over metahuman tools and workflows that can be used to achieve more likeness with our metahuman character.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We will also go through a hands-on session for creating a metahuman in Engine using the metahuman plugin for Unreal Engine with a face scan asset created using the RealityScan mobile app.

3
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The metahuman plugin allows you to create a metahuman from a 3D character mesh and is available from Engine versions 5.0 or later.

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You can also create a metahuman from facial footage with Engine versions 5.2 or later.

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To use the plugin, begin by installing the metahuman plugin to the appropriate Engine version from the fab marketplace.

6
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Once the plugin is installed, inside of your Unreal Engine project, open up the plugin's menu, enable the metahuman plugin, and then restart the Engine.

7
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This plugin is already installed and enabled in our course project.

8
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For our hands-on exercise, we will be using a face scan that was captured using the RealityScan mobile app.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
RealityCapture is a company that is part of Epic Games, and you can use the standalone or mobile app version for free by signing in with your Epic Games account.

10
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If using the RealityScan mobile app, once you capture your scanned data, that data will be processed in the mobile app, and from there you can either export the 3D model or share it on Sketchfab.

11
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Once you have the asset, inspect it, and then import it into Unreal Engine.

12
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Using the face scan data that has been captured with the RealityScan mobile app, let's dive into a hands-on exercise and create a metahuman in Unreal Engine.
