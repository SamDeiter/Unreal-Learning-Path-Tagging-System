00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
In this section of our course, we will begin by learning how to access the MetaHuman creator

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.439
using Quixel Bridge.

3
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.240
And from there, we will dive into the MetaHuman creator and explore all of its tools.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
Let us begin our journey by first learning how to access the MetaHuman creator using

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.960
the Unreal Engine 5 Quixel Bridge integration, and then look at some of the additional assets

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.120
we can download with the Quixel Bridge standalone application.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.399
So let's jump into Unreal Engine and go through the steps.

8
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.719
To access MetaHumans directly in Unreal Engine, in the main viewport, go to the Get Content

9
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.719
panel and select Quixel Bridge.

10
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.840
With Quixel Bridge open, ensure you sign in using your Epic Games account.

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.800
On the top right, go to Preferences and ensure you have a Megascans folder path assigned.

12
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.800
Now, select the MetaHuman's option in the Quixel Bridge menu.

13
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.359
Then select a preset MetaHuman.

14
00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:23.359
And then on the right hand side, over here, select Start MetaHuman creator.

15
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:29.280
The browser will open and prompt you to select the engine version you wish to work with.

16
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.799
And from here, select Launch MetaHuman creator.

17
00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.879
Now before we move on, let's do a quick review of the steps we just covered.

18
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:47.039
To access MetaHumans directly in Unreal Engine, use the Get Content panel to access Quixel Bridge.

19
00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:59.199
Sign in using your Epic Games account and inside of Preferences ensure you have a Megascans folder assigned.

20
00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:04.399
From there, select the MetaHuman's option in the Quixel Bridge menu.

21
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.159
Select a preset and then select Start MetaHuman creator.

22
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:17.840
Once the browser opens, select the engine version you are working in and then launch the MetaHuman creator.

23
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:28.080
Now let's take a look at using the Quixel Bridge standalone application for use with MetaHumans.

24
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:42.960
The Quixel Bridge standalone applications allows for Maya and Zebra scopes to be downloaded for DNA files to be accessed and for exporting MetaHumans to Unreal Engine 4.27.

25
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.080
Begin by going to the web browser link for Quixel Bridge and sign in with your Epic Games account.

26
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.000
From there, download and install the application.

27
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.360
The Quixel Bridge plugin will be located in the Epic Games launcher and should automatically install along with the latest versions of the engine.

28
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:15.759
Now let's jump into the Quixel Bridge standalone application and take a look at some of our options.

29
00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:23.599
Inside of the Quixel Bridge standalone application, navigate to the Quixel Bridge menu on the top left

30
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.799
and select the MetaHuman's option.

31
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:36.959
Then select MetaHuman presets for the engine version you are using, which in our case will be the MetaHuman presets for Unreal Engine 5.

32
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:47.759
By selecting any MetaHuman preset, you can access the MetaHuman creator by selecting Start MetaHuman creator over here on the right.

33
00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:56.319
You can download and export MetaHuman presets or ones you've created to Autodesk Maya.

34
00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:10.239
To do this with a MetaHuman selected, go to the bottom right and over here if you click here next to the resolution option, you can select the download or export settings.

35
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.799
We are going to select the download settings first.

36
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.639
In the download settings, go to models and make sure the download option for MetaHuman is set to source assets.

37
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.600
If you are using Unreal Engine 4.27, set it to UAsset and SourceAsset.

38
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.160
Now let's go back and select export settings.

39
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:47.280
In the export target tab, change the export target to Autodesk Maya and install the Maya plugin if it is not already installed.

40
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.400
Upon opening up Autodesk Maya, the MS plugin pop-up will appear, which means the plugin has been successfully installed.

41
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.240
The next step is to download a MetaHuman by going to the bottom right corner and selecting download.

42
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.920
A green check mark will appear indicating that the download process is complete.

43
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.000
Now if you want to export this to Autodesk Maya, with the blank Maya scene open, you can select export.

44
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:31.840
Another thing you can do is access the MetaHuman DNA and Maya Source Assets files by going to the vertical ellipsis right below the thumbnail and select go to files.

45
00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.599
This will open up the location of the downloaded assets in your Megascans folder.

46
00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.719
Now let's do a quick review of everything we've just covered.

47
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:53.599
We have just gone over how to select MetaHuman presets for Unreal Engine 5 inside of the Quixel Bridge standalone application.

48
00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:01.759
We've also covered that we need to change the download settings to SourceAssets and the export target to Autodesk Maya

49
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.719
along with installing the Maya plugin.

50
00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:11.279
The MS plugin pop-up icon will appear in Maya ensuring the plugin is installed.

51
00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:22.079
We've also learned how we can locate and access our downloaded assets in our Megascans folder such as our MetaHuman DNA and Maya Source files.

52
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:30.079
Now that we have covered this information, let's dive into the MetaHuman creator.
