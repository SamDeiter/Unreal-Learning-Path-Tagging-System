00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello and welcome to MetaHuman Introduction.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.720
My name is Gabriela Crisenio-Tacas and I will be your host for this course.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.919
In this course we will begin with an overview of the MetaHuman framework and MetaHuman

4
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.000
sample projects.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.640
From there we will go over how to access the MetaHuman creator using the Quixel Bridge

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.600
Unreal Engine 5 integration and go over some additional assets we can download with the

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.039
Quixel Bridge standalone application.

8
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.600
Then we will dive into the MetaHuman creator and explore all of its tools.

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.679
From there we will move into a hands-on session for creating a MetaHuman in Engine with the

10
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:51.040
MetaHuman plugin using a RealityScanFaceScan asset.

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.960
We will also go over how to bring a MetaHuman into Unreal Engine and go over some best practices

12
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.240
when working with them in your project.

13
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.680
We will wrap up this course with some final recommendations by going over how MetaHumans

14
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.439
can be used for vertical specific applications and I will provide you with some tips and

15
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:20.879
resources for continuing your work and training with MetaHumans.

16
00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:30.479
This course will be using the project MEH9130055 and the level map should load automatically.

17
00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:40.319
The map is located in the content browser under the courses folder labeled MEH11301

18
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:47.879
in the course maps folder and it is named MEH11301MAP.

19
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:54.079
This course will also use a RealityScanFaceScan asset with textures.

20
00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.879
The asset is located under the assets folder in the folder named scanMesh.

21
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:06.640
Additionally the original OBJ file and textures have also been provided in the source files

22
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.719
folder named 11301 RealityScan associated with this course.

23
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.960
If you need to reference the location of the course map that can be found at the beginning

24
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.599
of the slide deck after the training outline.

25
00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.960
Now as we go through this course you will find that many slides in this presentation

26
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.599
contain a lot of information and I will summarize all of that for you but if at any point you

27
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.639
want to read what is on each of those slides feel free to pause and dive right in.

28
00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:43.639
Now let's move on to the first section of this course and begin by exploring the MetaHuman

29
00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.639
framework and some MetaHuman sample projects.
