  "text": " So as promised, let's start by talking about ray tracing. So what is ray tracing? Well, rasterization is typically utilized here. So objects in a scene are created by a virtual mesh of triangles. Hence the baking method, looking at every object shape and material relationship is written in the G buffer and the lighting reads per pixel properties. So and it performs with lighting them. So you can see the polygon is drawn. The polygon is drawn. We have the rasterization to pixels here. And essentially anywhere where the polygon is drawn, it rasterizes those pixels. So the ray trace relies on a system of bouncing photons from the object to another object before reaching the camera to produce some kind of image here. So to set up ray tracing in our scene, we want to first load up the project settings and we want to turn on a few properties here. So we want to support hardware ray tracing. We want that enabled. We want ray trace shadows in the ray trace skylight. We want the texture level of detail, which is optional for optimization, but it will help the scene's performance here. SM6 is also optional, which is primarily used for lumen based projects. So again, that's up to you, depending on your project's needs here. And then we want to also make sure the support compute skin cache is enabled. And then another optional toggle here, we've got the modeling mode where we want to maybe enable the ray tracing while editing. And the new mesh objects enable ray tracing there as well. So for a little bit better quality in the project settings as well, we can have the Gbuffer format to high precision normals, which should be on by default, but it's always worth double checking depending on the maybe template that you might have loaded up your scene with. We also want to make sure the reflection method is the standalone ray traced method. So just ensure these two are enabled. And then we want to set the reflection capture quality to either 1024 or 2048. In this instance, the higher the number, it's going to be better quality. And it can help if you're using a combination of both for ray tracing as a fallback. So just then make sure your normals are high resolution for any key areas and items, which could be classed as hero objects in the scene. And that will prevent any kind of sorting issues. You can do that per mesh in the details of the properties there. And then to look at the materials when working with ray tracing, we want to use this node to replace the entire part of your material logic to lower the cost of features such as ray tracing global illumination, ray traced reflections, ray traced translucency, with some class less complex logic. And this is also a global change that will affect all ray tracing effects. So we have this kind of switch parameter here that you want to look into. And then in this example, the normal path logic renders as seen in the scene. And then the ray tracing path will use a less complex logic for effects in the ray tracing, such as the RTGI and the reflections where textures, normals and roughness can become an expensive added cost. So it's worth noting that the path tracer quality switch replace can be used now instead of the ray trace. So if you're going to end up using path tracer, which we'll be discussing later in this course from the ray tracing, you wouldn't have to adjust your materials to compensate since they are already handled differently. And then the material switch parameter that we want in the switch here, you can create some kind of manual switch via static switch parameter. And then you can just enable and disable that based on the given materials instanced version. So it can be used on a shot by shot basis, for example, to shut off, shut off any unneeded or heavy aspects of the material. So essentially just swaps in and out the most performant material in any given scene. So we always want to keep our material simple. If we can with less roughness details, since they do come at a cost. So if you're not working in games and not worried about frame rates, such as film, where you just need a high quality render or even some aspects of virtual production. So a lot of these things are going to be very project dependent. Figure out what your project needs and whether it needs to run in real time or it can be rendered offline. And that will allow you to decide on the approach that you take with the materials. It's also worth noting that the light type that works well with ray tracing is the rec light. So similar to Meyers and Max's area light, each light can be used for ray tracing, but the rec light has some nice control for the shadows. So all lights must be set to a movable for ray trace to be active in the light. And you can also control in the light under the ray tracing samples per pixel for shadow control. So it's not always needed, but can help with the shadow quality. And typically a setting of one works well here. So the higher the number, it can get more expensive, not necessarily always needed. So it's just about the trade off dial in those numbers, how you think they work best in your project. And just know that the higher, higher the number, the more expensive it could get. And then to get the soft shadows, we can use a spotlight so we can control the source radius to control the softness. We've got the point light, which will control the source radius, which is low and hard shadows and higher soft shadows. We've got the rec light, which the barn door tries to simulate the cinematic lights, which samples per pixel. We've got a directional light where the source angle can soften the light. And then we've also got a skylight where using the set source to SLS captured scene or SLS specified cube map. By default, the ray trace is off due to cost calculating connected to the BP sky, which can ultimately be very expensive for your scene and expensive in this instance just means it comes at a high performance cost. So to look at a source texture input on your properties here, we can use textures to help push real realism in our scene. And a light that can be used to achieve this is the rec light. And by plugging in a source texture here, we can get some cool results. So this will be helped by the light reflection to mimic its intended real world space. And the spec may at times have to be tweaked if the actual physical shape of the light persists. And so looking at some post process control here, we've got global illumination, which is the method standalone ray trace. So this may be deprecated in them only, but it will be around for a little bit as a great for visuals for final pixel. And it's not been fully absorbed by the other methods. We also have ray trace global illumination, which global illumination is sometimes referred to as GI. So it is used to control the global illumination here. And we can choose the quality final gather versus brute force. So brute force for better quality. But again, it comes at an expense. And in this instance, it's on the GPU. We've got ray trace reflections, which can give you higher max bounces and samples per pixel for the best results. And then we also have the sample and bounces that can help a scene. But again, they can be costly. So with all these kind of ray tracing elements, you've got to think about the cost versus visual payoff. And you can set your ray trace reflections shadows to area. We also have ray trace ambient occlusion, which allows for high quality shadows. We have translucency, but any kind of translucency, especially with ray tracing, can be costly. So ray trace can be hard on more than one translucent object in the scene. So keeping track of how many you have, if you're layering up multiple translucent surfaces, that could come at quite an expensive cost. So just make sure you're considering that overhead there. And then we've also got the ray trace translucency, which allows for greater control and max bounce and refractions. But it can make things more realistic as well with that cost of the performance. So in ray trace mode, like last refraction, caustics, for example, is not possible, but does have soft shadows now. We also can look at emphasizing the reflection quality to show realism. So the number of bounces are key, but try to keep them at one or two range to prevent any performance hits. We've got the samples per pixel, which can also help, but keep that range low at first. And the shadows currently have a hard shadow option and area. So again, with all these things, dial in the numbers, how you believe they look best in the scene, but know that they come with some kind of performance trade off, as with most things. So the max roughness should also be reduced to increase performance if needed. So when looking at ray tracing, the reflection quality is going to be key here. So for even stronger reflections in the geometry of the object, LOD 0, we want to use high precision tangent basis and then hit apply changes at the bottom. And this can really help clear up reflections for believability with less distortion. So FBXs will have it off by default. And if you are using Datasmith to import objects, it should have it already turned on there. And so any kind of troubleshooting you might have with ray tracing, there are a few CVars that you can use to print to the screen to see what is happening here. So first of all, we want to make sure all lights that are meant for ray tracing are movable. If you have ray tracing enabled, if you've got any static lights in your scene, you're going to get an error on your editor window. You may even get some preview textures in the scene. So you just want to make sure any lights that are in the level are set to movable. Using the world outline, if you just type in the light and search for all the lights, select them all and just make sure they're all set to movable. And then each light should also be set to cast ray trace shadows by default. Skylight doesn't currently have this on by default. So it's worth making a note of that. Again, depending on which engine version you're using, this may have changed. So just make a note and then you can always just check that in the relevant projects. Then console commands can be used with Blueprint to help optimize visuals such as ray trace reflections, max distance and toggle features on and off, etc. So higher bounces can help with noise, but be careful. As we said before, it can help some areas but cause pixelation in others depending on the materials. So we can also try setting this CVAR reflection capture one, which can use to fake a second bounce of your ray tracing. So you may get the payoff of just setting your ray trace bounces at one that doesn't come as much of a performance impact as setting them at two, for example. But to get that second bounce, you might just fake it using the reflection capture. So always worth considering the kind of trade-offs between what you actually need in your scene. And then for far less gamey scenarios, you can use console variable tool and load CVARs ahead of time and test out the results. So there is the console variables window, which is definitely worth reading the more documentation of to add any console variables you use quite often into some presets within the console variables window there. And then when we're considering ray tracing global illumination, we want to think about geometry with small holes or some geometry with like small details. These things can impact the performance. So you'll notice these things in such as foliage and fences and all these kind of trim, trim style assets. So indoor environments are slower on performance than outdoor ones. So, for example, when a light enters from outside areas that are directly lit are faster than points that are indirectly lit. And then we also want to consider that the more ray tracing features that are being used, such as the reflections and translucency, the expense is going to rise there. So we can turn off the ray tracing global illumination and use a screen space solution instead with ray trace reflections, which will give you more performance if you're experiencing frame rate issues. But just know the screen space is going to have some kind of impact on the quality because it's going to be based on where the camera is looking. And it may just not give you as realistic results as you may be expecting them. We can also help with performance by using this CVAR here, which traces significantly less. Maybe try setting it to 25 or 50 if 25 is blurry. And then we can also enable material sorting, which helps improve the cost of the shaded reflection services. And then material sorting sorts the reflection shading work by material coherence. So this comes with some overhead. And so the material shading is only a win when the shading coherence is a limiter. Maybe gains of something like 50 percent are not uncommon with this type of feature. So always worth trying out all these different approaches and seeing what works for your project. Again, given the desired end result that you're looking for, whether it's currently in real time or offline rendered, we can also use a hybrid ray tracing looking at reflections bait, meaning that it's easier on the bounces after a certain distance. So it'll go to screen space after that distance. So you can try setting that to one or zero, depending on what your result is there. And then ray trace reflections are expensive and can be managed using the reflection actors as the last bounce in the ray trace reflections. There's also a few additional commands that can help visuals when linking to a blueprint. So if the materials are not rendering correctly, we can use these CVARs to evaluate a skylight correctly. And then also to test the effects of our materials, we have another console command just to make sure all the materials are set up correctly for ray tracing. And then this command at the bottom can be helpful, but it's best to pick and walk through the effects like turning them on and off, alternatively just testing the impact that it'll have. So if you set this to minus one, it will use a previous setting enabled for your project. And so essentially you can just turn on all ray trace visuals. Just a word of warning here, to have precaution, because especially if your hardware is at a certain setting, then it may cause a lot of slowdown or even crashing in some instances. So worth watching out for. And then in terms of optimization, we can reduce the bounces, but reducing the bounces can make the scene smoother, but you may just get a less visual fidelity of what you want. So translucent materials are expensive, as we said before. And so you can see kind of the ratio between dialing in the maximum bounces for a translucent surface and then also that GPU cost on the translucent surface. So it's worth considering how many bounces you're setting in your ray trace projects. And if a card is timing out, it's worth checking out the link here that you can see just to get some resolution to any technical issues you might be experiencing on the GPU. We also have some light editing and samples. So the skylight resolution control, you can set that to res 1024. And then each light has the ray trace samples per pixel. So we can dial this up based on the scene and the images that we're using. So you want to keep that low at first. Again, this is going to be a very consistent theme throughout this course, just dialing up those visuals as you need them rather than throwing everything at the scene and then pulling it back is maybe the better approach. So we can balance our performance versus the visual fidelity, lack of noise. So higher ray trace samples are in the light, the slower performance. So one is a good start, higher might have limited results. So it's that exponential trade off between getting them to a good result. And if it adds twice as much overhead, but doesn't really change your visuals much, you've got to kind of make those trade offs there. And you can also start with final gather settings where max bounces might be at four and then the sample per pixel is 16. So for the best quality results, use brute force. So the con you're going to get lower frame rate, but you'll also be able to reduce the reflection noise for both, or you might be able to speed up the frame rate at a visual cost with the ray trace reflections and using that samples per pixel option there. We can also use the final gather. So it's currently based on a world distance measured from the original shading point. And this rejection criteria defaults to 10 units. So you want to set the max bounces to one, you want to set samples per pixel to 16, and then any additional max bounces beyond one are silently discarded when adjusting the samples per pixel. And it's then best to increase it by the powers of two. So 816, 32, 64, and then to aid in suppressing temporal ghosting artifacts, you can cause the following command to modify, can use the following command sorry to modify the world space rejection criteria. So you can dial in that and just set the number of units there. These slides were created by Sean Spitzer today. And as always, there is plenty of documentation online following this link.
