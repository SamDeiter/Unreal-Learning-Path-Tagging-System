  "text": " Now, before we dive into actually creating our sequence, there are a few core principles or structures that we need to understand as it relates to translating traditional film terminology to game development or at least a game engine. So some of the engine terminology that we've used, which you probably know about, are things like static and skeletal meshes. We have actors, pawns, characters. We have worlds, maps, levels, level sequences, control rig, which is a animation feature that we have available in the engine, volumes. In fact, we will talk about using trigger volumes when we do our shot creation process, blueprints, as well as source control. Some of our sequencer terminology that's important to understand is scene assemblies. So this is going to be as we bring things together collectively. We have performance takes. We have sets, layouts, and staging, which will be very similar to our world maps and levels. But we're going to be using that terminology slightly different as we're doing our assembly process. Level sequences and shot sequences, as well as just shots. In this particular slide on the left, we have more traditional film terminology, and with that we have things like a film, like a feature or short film. We have acts, so various different major blocks within our film storytelling process. We have sequences, scenes, shots, and takes. And on the right, we have the terminology that we traditionally use when it comes to establishing these same things with Unreal. So we have things like film or a master sequence. For our act that we would call in film, we call that more or less just a level sequence. And then you'll see we have a level sequence within the actual sequence, the scene itself. Again, keep in mind that a sequence is really just a container. It's how we use it that changes the way that it operates and it functions within the engine. And then, of course, after our level sequence, we have shots and we have takes. Now something to keep in mind here is that even though this terminology is something that's often widely adopted by the industry, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to use this verbatim. The most important thing when it comes to establishing sequencer or your sequencer workflow is make sure that you have a system that's both scalable and simple enough that the average person can understand its core structure, how to use it, etc. The last thing you want to do is get towards the end of production and realize you have content spread everywhere within your project. So again, on this slide, this is really more just guideposts to help you when it comes to establishing your workflow with sequencer and how to best organize it based off of the traditional principles of film. Now there are a few plugins that are often used in game development. Now, one major caveat is all of the plugins that we have here on screen. You don't necessarily have to have these plugins enabled if you're going to be working within game development. As an example, you may not have any motion capture suits or using the AR kit from Apple to do like, for example, facial capture. So you could disable the Apple AR kit and Live Link. However, if you are using that workflow, you're going to want to have those plugins enabled. And you can see that there are a series of other different plugins that translate to allowing you to create those real time sequences or to be able to do motion capture, right? Things that are often used in game development as it relates to creating cinematics, in game cutscenes or anything where sequencer would come into play. So, So, So, So, So, So,",
