00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we have our landscape created, we're going to take a look at how we can use a few

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.480
of the tools Unreal Engine 5 provides to sculpt the landscape.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.560
Now the tools that we're going to be using are going to include the Sculpt, Erosion,

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.440
Hydro, and Noise tool, but there are other tools that we can use which I encourage you

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.400
to mess around with outside of this tutorial.

6
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.439
Now to use the tools, you simply click on which tool you want and then the left mouse

7
00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.759
button will apply the brush and if you hold down shift while pressing the left mouse button,

8
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.000
you will do the opposite.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.920
So for example, if I'm on Sculpt that I press the left mouse button, I will raise the terrain

10
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.920
up.

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.439
If I hold down shift and press the left mouse button, I will push that terrain back down

12
00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.659
or make it go negative.

13
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.519
Each one of the tools, there's also going to have some tool settings, but there are some

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.760
tool settings and brush settings that are common between any tool that you have selected

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.320
that involves a brush.

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.760
This is both the tool strength which controls the intensity that the applying brush has

17
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
on the landscape.

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.400
So the closer this number is set to one, the stronger, the more intense that effect will

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400
be.

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.280
One pro tip with the tool strength is that less is often more with this, so using numbers

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.320
like 0.1 or 0.2 are going to have a much better result and allow you to have more control.

22
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.519
Brush size allows us to control the size of our brush and we can also use the shortcut

23
00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:39.079
key left bracket and right bracket to increase or decrease the brush size.

24
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:46.680
Brush falloff allows us to control the falloff or how dome like our brush is going to look

25
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.680
as the falloff increases to 1, we're going to get a smoother looking brush and then as

26
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.480
we decrease that number back to 0, we're going to get a much sharper brush especially at

27
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480
the sides.

28
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.280
This last option we see here, use clay brush, we'll demonstrate this in just a little bit,

29
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.560
but this is unique to the Sculpt tool and we'll turn the Sculpt tool into this additive

30
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.200
brush which allows us to make some really interesting features that we can further refine later

31
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
on.

32
00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.159
So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and start using the noise tool to break up

33
00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.639
our landscape and our goal is to get something that looks kind of like this where we have

34
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.560
some highs and some lows and let's go over to the editor now.

35
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.519
So inside of the Unreal editor, we want to make sure that we are in landscape mode so

36
00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.719
if you're not, we come up to selection and go to landscape and then we're going to select

37
00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.719
here the noise tool.

38
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.759
We're going to make sure our tool strength is set to 0.2, that our noise mode is set

39
00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:48.319
to both and I'm going to increase my brush size a little bit, probably something like

40
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.639
that and what we're going to do now is I'm just going to start to paint here by holding

41
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.479
again the left mouse button and you can see here what it's doing is it is increasing and

42
00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.539
decreasing the height of my landscape.

43
00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:05.000
So spent the next few minutes increasing and decreasing the size of your landscape to give

44
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.039
you some nice areas to work with.

45
00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.239
You can also mess around with the various options inside of the tool to kind of really

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.120
get a feel for how things are working and again we're trying to get something that looks

47
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.040
like this.

48
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.680
Now once you have gotten that, the next tool that we're going to look at is going to be

49
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.240
the sculpt tool and specifically with the sculpt tool we're going to enable this use

50
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.240
a clay brush option and what this is going to do is it's going to make it really easy

51
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.320
for us to kind of make the beginning of mountains.

52
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.400
So let's take a look at how we do that now.

53
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.540
So in the editor I'm going to click over to sculpt and I'm going to make sure that my

54
00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:45.340
use clay brush is enabled which it is here and then I'm going to decrease my brush size

55
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:55.419
and something like that and we can see here as I start to paint in one area I get these

56
00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.859
really nice looking kind of round mounts.

57
00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.139
Now if I was to disable the clay brush here you can see it's going to bring it up more

58
00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.459
brings up the slopes a little bit more and in some instances that's great but I'll

59
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.980
oftentimes I find that when I'm trying to begin an area trying to make some mountains

60
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.259
that look kind of cool or some plateaus or something like that that using the clay brush

61
00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.300
in this manner works really well.

62
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.060
So now what I want everybody to do is spend a little time going through their area and

63
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.300
figuring out how they're going to make various brushes work for their project.

64
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.660
Remember you can also use the bracket keys to bring the brush down in size so left bracket

65
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:45.380
goes down and then right bracket goes up to give you some variation in your project.

66
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.100
Then once that is complete we're going to use the smooth tool to smooth out areas of

67
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.060
our landscape and you might often click on the tool over here and you might think that

68
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.940
well let's just do something like this and just smooth everything at once and while that

69
00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.939
might give you results it is really going to destroy everything.

70
00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.699
What you actually want to do here is we want to make sure that things like I'm going to

71
00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.060
also set this down to like 0.1 that things like this are you know not too crazy for us

72
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.620
here because that's going to result in some weird rendering from the triangles but it's

73
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.180
also just not going to work for when the player tries to run over it or view it it's going

74
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.019
to look like an error.

75
00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:33.180
So again just kind of smoothing out kind of areas that we have so we get some good looking

76
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.779
topology but we're also kind of keeping the highs and the lows.

77
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.659
Remember I set that tool strength down to 0.1 because I want to just barely get some

78
00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.859
of this stuff smoothed out so I still have some really cool looking terrain to work with

79
00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:53.939
when we go to our next step which is going to be applying erosion and stuff like that.

80
00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.939
So spend the next few minutes pause the video and go ahead and smooth things out so that

81
00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.740
you get a little bit of a smoother result here and when you come back we're going to

82
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.100
take a look at using erosion.

83
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:15.139
Now the erosion tools are used in a similar manner as the smooth tool.

84
00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:21.420
We don't want to apply erosion to everything we want to start somewhere and apply erosion

85
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.540
locally and what I mean by that again is we don't want to come in here with our erosion

86
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.060
so I'll come here to this erosion and bring this you know we don't want to apply this

87
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.460
this might work but it's not going to give us the best results.

88
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.020
What we want to do here is start at the top of something and I make my brush really small

89
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.580
and remember erosion starts at the top and brings stuff down so when we're doing erosion

90
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.700
we always want to start at the top and bring things down that's going to give us the best

91
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.340
looking results.

92
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.900
So again what I want everybody to do now is using the various tools that we just talked

93
00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.539
about the sculpt the erosion the smooth and we can even use the hydro again with the hydro

94
00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.379
we want to do from the top down to the bottom so you can see it's going to give us a similar

95
00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:07.419
result to erosion but I want everybody to spend some time now really working on getting

96
00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:14.339
some great looking just terrain using these various tools and when you have something

97
00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.299
done like this go ahead and move on to the next part where we'll talk about creating

98
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.660
material that we can use to help paint our landscape giving it the look of grass, rocks

99
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.740
and dirt.
