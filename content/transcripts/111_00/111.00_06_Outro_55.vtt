00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
And with that, that is going to wrap things up for this video tutorial.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.519
So we first started this video tutorial by creating a new landscape.

3
00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.920
We then took a look at some of the tools that we could use to sculpt our landscape.

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.320
We then took a look at how we could create a material that allowed us to paint different

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.280
landscape layers, giving the illusion that we had things like brass, rocks, and dirt.

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.320
And then finally, we finished up with looking at how we can use the foliage tool to apply

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.600
various bits of foliage to the landscape and paint and interact with those foliage actors

8
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.719
so that we can adjust them or scale them or even delete them.

9
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.799
With that said, I want to thank everybody for listening.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.520
It was my pleasure having you and I will see you next time.
