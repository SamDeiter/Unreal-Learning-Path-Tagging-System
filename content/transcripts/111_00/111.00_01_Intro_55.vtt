Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with

2
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:06.679
EVE Games.

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.080
In the following video tutorial, we're going to be taking a look at how we can quickly

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.320
get started using Landscape in any of our Unreal Engine 5 projects.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.359
Topics include creating a new landscape, then how we can use the tools to sculpt that landscape,

6
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.400
then look at how we can create a simple material to paint on our landscape giving it colors,

7
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.679
and then finally we'll take a look at how we can use the foliage tool to apply various

8
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.560
static meshes to our landscape to act as foliage.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.359
We've got a lot to get into, so let's go ahead and get started with creating a new landscape.
