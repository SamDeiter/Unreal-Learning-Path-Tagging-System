00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we have our landscape sculpted, let's take a look at how we can paint the landscape.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now before we can start painting the landscape, what we're going to need to do first is create a material

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that uses a node called the Landscape Layer Blend.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And the Landscape Layer Blend allows us to basically do that blend between these various layers.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now for this example, we're going to be creating it using just some colors.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to make a dirt, a rock, and a grass.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now if you are in the Landscape Tools, you should come out of them by coming up to the selection mode here

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and just going into selection to get out of the tools if you're in them.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're going to hit Control Space on the keyboard, come to our content, and then right click and make a material.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We're going to call this new material M-A-T underscore Landscape.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then once we have created it, we're going to double click on it to open it up.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Just bring this over here.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now what we're going to do first is we're going to look for our Landscape Layer Blend.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So to do that, we're going to right click in the graph of the material and look for our Landscape.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And right there we have our Landscape Layer Blend.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now by default, there are actually no inputs for this node.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So to add some, what we need to do is make sure we have the node selected.

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And then in the Details panel under Layers, we need to add three elements.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can see that as soon as I do that, I get a Layer None, Layer None, and Layer None.

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now for this example, we are going to have a dirt, a rock, and a grass.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So each one of these indexes, layers, names is going to be named like this.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And you can see here I have my layer dirt, my layer rock, and my layer grass.

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So next what we're going to do is we're going to right click and we're going to look for a vector.

25
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And we want a vector parameter.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So just type in vector and then PA and there's a vector parameter.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're going to call this first one dirt.

28
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I'm going to give it a default color of some kind of like a dirtish looking something.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So maybe something a little bit like that.

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay, we're going to plug this in to our dirt.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then what we're going to do is we're going to right click on this and duplicate it.

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And then we're going to call this New One Rock.

33
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And then we're going to give it a new color, kind of like a grayish color.

34
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We'll go a little bit of a darker gray, a little bit too dark.

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
All right, and then we're going to plug this into our rock.

36
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And then we're going to right click and duplicate again.

37
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And we're going to call this one grass.

38
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm going to give this some type of darkish kind of grassy looking color.

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
There we go.

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then we're going to plug this right here.

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, once that is completed, we need to take the output from our landscape layer blend

42
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and bring that right into this base color.

43
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And then let's just compile and save our material.

44
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Because the next thing that we're going to do here is once we've done this part,

45
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're now going to do this part, which is going to add a normal to this.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is going to make it a little bit easier to see the differences between them.

47
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And it's just going to give a little bit more life to our material.

48
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So let's go back over here to our material.

49
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And this is actually really cool.

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
What we can do now is we can right click on this and duplicate it and bring it down here.

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And we're just going to plug this right into our normal.

52
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And then what we're going to do is don't mind that.

53
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That'll be taken care of in just a second.

54
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We're going to make some parameters to control the size of our textures.

55
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So we're going to left click and look for something called a landscape.

56
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And we're going to look for this landscape layer coordinates.

57
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
There we go.

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then what we're going to do is we're going to look for a constant.

59
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And for this constant, we're going to give it a value of one.

60
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But we also want to make this adjustable inside of the material instance.

61
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So we're going to right click on it and convert it to a parameter.

62
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And then we're going to call this normal tile.

63
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Then what we need to do next is we need to multiply these two together.

64
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So we're going to drag off of this and look for a mole and under our math multiply.

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We're going to add that.

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And then we're going to take the output of our normal tile and plug that right into our multiply there.

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now with the tiling logic set up, the next thing that we need to do is create our normal map.

68
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So to do this, there's a couple of different ways.

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
One of the ways that we can add a normal map is by just holding down the t key and clicking.

70
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And that's going to add a texture sample.

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So again, I just did that by holding down the t key on the keyboard and left clicked.

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Then we're going to right click on this and convert it to a parameter.

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And we're going to call this n underscore dirt.

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And we're going to do a couple of things now.

75
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We are going to take the multiply and plug that into our UV.

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And then on the n underscore dirt, we're also going to need to give it a default texture.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So we're going to look for something here.

78
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm just going to look for dirt.

79
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We'll just do an underscore n and then we will give it something like, I don't know, this rocky something looks pretty good.

80
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Okay.

81
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So the next thing that we need to do is we need another one of these for our rock and our grass.

82
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So this is actually going to be really quick because we already have most of this set up.

83
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So all we need to do is right click, duplicate and then instead of calling this n dirt, we're going to call this n underscore rock.

84
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
We're going to plug the multiply in to our UV right there.

85
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And then if we want, we can change this.

86
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We'll just do underscore in to look for again some normal maps and we'll do maybe some ground gravel.

87
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
There we go.

88
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And then right click, duplicate, pull this down.

89
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I'm going to call it n underscore graph.

90
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And then like we did before, we're going to bring the multiply down into the UVs and then we're going to look for something.

91
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We actually have a ground moss.

92
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There we go.

93
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That'll work for us for the time being.

94
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And then what we need to do is we need to plug these into the respective inputs on the landscape layer blend.

95
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
All right, so let's just apply and save.

96
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So we are done with that, but there's a couple of things that we need to do next.

97
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So what we're going to do is we need to select our landscape and apply this material, but we're not going to apply the material itself.

98
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What we're going to do is we're going to make an instance of that material and the instance is going to make it easier for us to adjust.

99
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So we're going to come back over here.

100
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I'm going to close.

101
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Oops, said back over here.

102
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We're going to close this down.

103
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I'm going to hit control space.

104
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
On our material landscape, I'm going to right click and go create material instance.

105
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
All right, so that's going to create our landscape material instance.

106
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And then what we're going to do is we're going to select our landscape.

107
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Make sure our material instance is selected in the content browser here and over in the details panel, we're going to look for our material, which if we come down here, it's going to be under our landscape and then our landscape material.

108
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And we're going to say use selected asset from the content browser.

109
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And this is going to take just a second.

110
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There we go.

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And we're not seeing anything.

112
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And that's because we need to assign something called weight blended layers to each one of our layers for our landscape.

113
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And what these are going to act as is a mask so that when we go to paint, we can expose the dirt or the rock or the grass.

114
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So let's take a look at how we do that right now.

115
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So we're going to come over here to our selection mode and go down to landscape.

116
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And then we're going to make sure we're on the paint tool.

117
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And you can see here there are no current layers assigned.

118
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So what we want to do so that we're on default, and then we're going to hit the create layers from assigned materials.

119
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And that's going to create our different layers here.

120
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
All right.

121
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And then what we need to do is we're going to come right here to the layer info and we're going to go where weight blended layer normal.

122
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's going to ask us where we want to save this and we're going to save it to the untitled three, which is just going to take this math name and put it in the folder.

123
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So we're going to save there.

124
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
There we go.

125
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And then we're going to do the same thing for our rock.

126
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We're going to do the same thing again.

127
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There we go.

128
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And then we're going to do the same thing for our grass.

129
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now there are a few options that we have that are kind of under the hood, so to speak.

130
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And if you right click on the layers, you're going to get the ability to export or import, but you also have this fill clear and rebuild material so that fill is going to fill any particular layer with like doing a fill in Photoshop.

131
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You'll fill it with your dirt or your rock or your grass.

132
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The clear layer is going to do the opposite.

133
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
If you right click on this and clear it, it will get rid of the dirt, the rock or the grass and the rebuild materials is used.

134
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And if you happen to change your material drastically and you want to rebuild the material is used behind the scenes, then you will use that to do that.

135
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Now, all that's left to do is to paint.

136
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now there's actually two things that we can do.

137
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We can paint and we can smooth and basically paint will allow us to paint our various areas and then smooth will allow us to smooth the transition between those two.

138
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And by doing that, we can get something that looks like this.

139
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So again, let's pop over to the editor now and I'm going to come over here to my rock and let's say that, you know, I want to just come over here and start painting some rock.

140
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So there we go.

141
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So the rock selected brush probably a little bit smaller than that.

142
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So there we go.

143
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
There's that rock that I have added there.

144
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And then I can do the same thing with my grass.

145
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So there we go.

146
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And then if I want to, I can come here and I can smooth out kind of in between them.

147
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You can also use the bracket keys on your keyboard.

148
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Left bracket will make things smaller and the right bracket will make things, your brush bigger so that you can get a better smoothing and things like that.

149
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I'm going to hit control space because I also want to come over here and mention one thing about the landscape material instance.

150
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So if I was to bring this out and do something like, you know, normal tile, maybe we set this like 0.1.

151
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
You can see here, we're going to get a little bit of some better looking kind of tiling information on that.

152
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And then also we could do something like come here, maybe our grass is a little, little too green for my, my liking.

153
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we're going to maybe not make it black, but bring it back over here.

154
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
There we go.

155
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
That's a little bit better.

156
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It's a little too bright.

157
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
There we go.

158
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
That looks, that looks a way better for grass right there.

159
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So if I come here and go to paint, get some little bit better looking grass.

160
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So again, that's why we want to use this material instance because it makes it really easy for us to be able to adjust things as we are going on the fly.

161
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So what I want everybody to do now is take some time to paint their landscape and make adjustments.

162
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And when we come back, we will take a look at how we can apply mesh based foliage to our landscape to make the landscape look even more lush and full of life.

163
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Thank you.
