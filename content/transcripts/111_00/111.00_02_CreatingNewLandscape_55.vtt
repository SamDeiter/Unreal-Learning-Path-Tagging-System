00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
So, first things first, we're going to be creating a new landscape.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.759
And to do that, what we're going to do first is we're going to create a new basic level.

3
00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.439
And then once we do that, we're going to go ahead and click over to our landscape tool

4
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.000
to activate it.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.039
Then once our tool is activated, what we're going to do here is we're going to make sure

6
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.800
that the location is set to 000, that our section size is set to something relatively

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
small.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.679
Section sizes could control how many quads our landscape is, and making them bigger

9
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.159
is going to result in a larger landscape, making that number smaller is going to result

10
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.439
in a smaller landscape.

11
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.759
And then we're going to hit create.

12
00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:39.280
So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now and do this whole process.

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.359
So again, file new level, select the basic right here, going to hit create.

14
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.480
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this static mesh here that represents

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.039
our floor and hit delete.

16
00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.240
That's going to go ahead and delete that because we're making a landscape.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.879
We don't actually need that.

18
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.280
Next we're going to come up here to our selection mode and come down to landscape.

19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.040
And once we do that, it's going to activate our landscape tool.

20
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.079
Now since we don't have a landscape in the view yet, this is what we're going to see.

21
00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.280
This green outline represents where our landscape is going to be.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000
Make sure our location is in 000, that's good.

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.320
We're going to leave the scale exactly as it is.

24
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.480
And I'm going to take my section size, maybe down to 15 by 15, just to make my landscape

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.840
a little bit smaller and a little easier to manage for this example.

26
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.799
Once all of that has been done, I'm going to go ahead and hit the create button.

27
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.000
And you're going to see here my landscape is ready to be painted on.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.040
So in the next section of this video, what we're going to be taking a look is at how

29
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.320
to use the various sculpting tools to sculpt our landscape.

30
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320
So I'll see you in just a bit.
