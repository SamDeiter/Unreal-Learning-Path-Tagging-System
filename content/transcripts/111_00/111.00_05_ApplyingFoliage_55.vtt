00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
We're now going to take a look at how we can apply various static meshes as foliage.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.240
This is actually quite easy to do.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.359
The first thing we're going to need to do is open up the foliage tool.

4
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:18.039
Then once we have that open, we can actually apply any static mesh we want.

5
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.039
Let's take a look at how we do that now.

6
00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.679
We're going to come over here to the editor and I'm going to get out of the landscape

7
00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.120
tool and come down to the foliage tool.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.760
Before I can use it, I need to bring a mesh down.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.760
What I'm going to do is I'm going to hit control space.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm going to go to my starter content.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.520
We're going to look for our, I think it's under props.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.200
There we go.

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm just going to grab this bush and just drag that right there.

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.799
Now, as soon as I have done that, I will be able to now paint this piece of foliage here.

15
00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.000
And there we go.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.520
Look at that.

17
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.240
I can use a shift to erase.

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.400
And I also have the ability to come in here and actually select the individual foliage pieces.

19
00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:58.640
Let me just make sure G is on so we can see that.

20
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.759
And then I can do things like move this around.

21
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.280
I can rotate them.

22
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.640
I can even scale them.

23
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.239
And I can also delete them.

24
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.400
So this is really cool because this allows me to have finite control over a piece of

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.560
foliage and still use this tool to apply foliage to a massive area.

26
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.519
If we look further down, there are also a bunch of different options inside of the tool

27
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.960
that control things.

28
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
At the top, the painting, this is going to control the density.

29
00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.640
And as well as the size of the various instances that we're painting.

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.879
So if I was to set this to 1.5, we would get some between 1 and 1.5.

31
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.239
Let me set this to 0.5.

32
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.519
Make it a little bit smaller.

33
00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.879
There we go.

34
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.159
So we get a little bit of variety.

35
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:44.519
We also control the density and the radius here.

36
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:49.879
So the radius, if I was to set this to, say, like 200, what this will do is it will ensure

37
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.000
that they don't actually intersect with one another.

38
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.400
By providing a radius around it that it should spawn.

39
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.680
Now a great way to find this number here is if we just double click on this mesh.

40
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.319
Not that way.

41
00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.040
Let's just browse to this.

42
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840
There we go.

43
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.360
And if we look at the approximate size here in the Static Mesh Editor, it's 122.

44
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.879
So 122.

45
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:19.520
If we use that number here, that's going to be a great way to kind of use for our radius

46
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.920
for this particular object.

47
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.319
We can also add other objects by simply just dragging and dropping right there.

48
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.679
And then now we have chairs and bushes.

49
00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:36.119
If we right click on the chair here, we can also remove it, or we can replace it with something else.

50
00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.479
I'm just going to remove that.

51
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.159
I'm going to say yes.

52
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.239
There we go.

53
00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.039
So what I want everybody to do now is just spend some time applying foliage to your project.

54
00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.879
And this is what you can get.

55
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.919
This is using some content from FAB.

56
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.719
There's a few stones and things like that.

57
00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.680
We're just all randomly scattered throughout using the foliage tool.

58
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.520
So I want everybody to take some time now to use the foliage tool and adjusted settings

59
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.000
and paint some foliage on your landscape and see what you get.
