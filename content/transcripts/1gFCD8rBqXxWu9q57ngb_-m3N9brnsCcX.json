  "text": " Now, project settings overall is something I want to first talk about because the project settings contains a huge different variety of settings for your project. From in here, we can do everything such as change the renderer that's used for Unreal Engine 5 to be forward renderer. If we're making a VR project, we could also enable or disable ray tracing for either hardware or software or even implement a custom ray tracing or global illumination thing that we'd like to use for our project. I highly encourage that everybody go through this and have a look at the various settings that are inside of here because, again, there's just so much to this and some of these things will have a direct result on how your project looks. For example, as I was talking about forward rendering for a VR project, this is going to change the renderer, thus changing the way that things will look. So it's better to enable this now than towards the end of your project when you realize that you have to maybe remake a bunch of materials or adjust source assets to accommodate for these changes in the renderer. One of the other things I'd like to mention about this is that when you are adjusting things inside of here, oftentimes you do need to restart the editor in order to see that change. So make sure that once you have adjusted something, you restart the editor so those changes can take place. Oftentimes the reason you don't see something working is because this step was forgotten about or maybe overlooked because you were enabling or disabling other options and you just simply forgot about that. So remember restarting the editor is the best way to see these effects happen on your project. And remember, go through, have a look, and explore because there's a lot of things inside of here that can really help your project out in terms of performance and optimization.",
