00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi everyone, in this video we're going to go ahead and continue what we were doing with

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.640
animating materials and jump in and show some of the options in which we can edit things

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.439
and get the look that we need.

4
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.500
So let's get started.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.179
So jumping back into Unreal, we can see that we have our nodes set up here like we did

6
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.179
before.

7
00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.240
I'm going to shuffle some of these things down a little bit.

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.560
We're going to kind of repeat what we did before and get things in the order that we

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
need.

10
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.799
This is all up to you visually how you want things to look.

11
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:38.439
We can combine looks, we can add things to make things a little bit more exaggerated.

12
00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:42.159
And what I mean by that is maybe highlight the water a little bit more by pushing some

13
00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.640
values and we can do a little bit of that when it comes to our loading things in to

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.719
our specular and our rough, which we're going to do here.

15
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920
So first up, let's go and take a look at some of the options and some of the things we can

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.799
do for the specular slot.

17
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.439
Now we've put stuff in the middle slot and you don't necessarily have to do this for

18
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.119
this particular material.

19
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.000
But if you want to exaggerate things, you can add that.

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.319
It just depends how, what kind of values you want from the rock.

21
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:15.840
Now what I can do right now is maybe turn this off, disconnect this temporarily.

22
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.519
And we're going to go ahead and bring in and just move this off to the side.

23
00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.840
So we'll do a comparable later.

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.959
And let's go ahead and bring in the other textures that we need for the specular.

25
00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.519
Now for the specular, what we're using is that smooth texture again.

26
00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:32.559
So let's go ahead and I'm going to select it.

27
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.039
I'm going to minimize this just a little bit here, pull this in so we have a little more

28
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.039
real estate.

29
00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.239
I'm going to close my stats little window there and that actually tells me if things

30
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.119
are not connecting correctly.

31
00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:52.000
So I grabbed my smooth and do control D. It'll actually duplicate it right where my cursor

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.439
is at, which we talked about before.

33
00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.640
And we're going to go ahead and start connecting a few more things.

34
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.519
So let's go ahead and go in here and add the raindrops, but we're going to get the raindrops

35
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.400
that are a little bit more exaggerated dark and light.

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.639
So if we go back into our raindrops folder, let's go ahead and grab that one that says

37
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.360
metallic 02.

38
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.800
And we'll put that one up in here.

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.639
Now again, this isn't necessarily have to be connected to metallic.

40
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.840
I just did that for experimentation purposes.

41
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.000
So it's up to you how you want to do that.

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.319
And I'm going to go and combine these with a Lerp and I'm going to actually control how

43
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.360
strong that value comes through.

44
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.919
I'll show you what I mean.

45
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:37.280
So I came up here with a Piki again, but I make sure I do a negative one again for going

46
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.719
downward on our motion.

47
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.639
It's the same as we had before in the other pattern.

48
00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:49.599
And I'm going to go ahead and punch this in to the UVs for the metallic raindrops and

49
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.879
for the more smoother one.

50
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.960
I'm also going to do it.

51
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.360
Now what can be helpful is we can use alert.

52
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.439
I keep my finger the L key and this linear interpret node takes 50% of each one of these,

53
00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.439
kind of like 50.

54
00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.600
50 does a nice little blend and gives us an alpha for overall control.

55
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.040
So I'm going to go and push these into one, the B value for the bottom one and the A value

56
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.560
for the top one.

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.600
And then we're going to get a water spec control.

58
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.080
And I'm going to keep my finger on the S key and I'm going to left click and this will

59
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.160
be our scalar parameter and we'll call this spec control right there.

60
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.000
And we'll keep that value at zero and that's fine for the default because we're going to

61
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.480
make an instance material.

62
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm going to move that right into the alpha and then I'm going to move that right into

63
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.200
the spec.

64
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.560
So now we can kind of get a little bit of the same thing we had before, but favoring

65
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560
the spec.

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.760
So overall we can avoid maybe some of the unnecessary shininess that may occur from using a metallic

67
00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.159
material.

68
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.039
The add does help mute things a little bit, but in this particular case, this should be

69
00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.280
just fine.

70
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.280
And I'm going to move some of these textures down.

71
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.959
Let's move these down temporarily for a second.

72
00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.959
And let's go ahead and fill out some of these other values.

73
00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.959
Now what we can do with a rough is we can do a nice little experimental hybrid to get

74
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.879
maybe a little bit more wave movement going on.

75
00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.159
What I mean by that is I'll show you that we can add another texture layer in here.

76
00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.240
Now what I mean by layers in this particular case, I made it pretty loose.

77
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.040
We're going to just pretty much lay them on top each other in this case.

78
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.800
So first up, what we want to do is let's go ahead and make a roughness strength.

79
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.279
So I'm going to give my finger the S key and left click.

80
00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.279
There we go.

81
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.920
And we'll call this rough strength.

82
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.480
There we go.

83
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.439
And then we'll go ahead and keep a finger the M key left click and do multiply.

84
00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:57.040
And then let's go ahead and pull in some roughness for the stones, the overall texture.

85
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:06.960
So we'll go back into that mega scans stone one, river stone, and we'll pull in the roughness

86
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.120
that we have.

87
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.399
Now if you already have it, I think in our case, we may have already have it.

88
00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.399
There we go.

89
00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.399
I think I pulled it in earlier.

90
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.199
No, that's the AO.

91
00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.199
There's the roughness.

92
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.199
So we already have that in place.

93
00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.560
So I'm going to move this guy away.

94
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.000
And this roughness, we're going to go and punch set into the B channel.

95
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I'll multiply.

96
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.879
I'm going to put the rough strength into the E channel.

97
00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.319
And we're going to now use a blend overlay.

98
00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.600
Now typically what you can do, you can swap these out.

99
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.879
This basically uses a multiplier.

100
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.639
You multiply as one against the other.

101
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.959
So again, like we talked about before, it's similar to working with Photoshop.

102
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.519
So if I wanted to, I could even flip these and still kind of get the same effect in

103
00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.519
this particular case.

104
00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.519
And I'll leave those up there for now.

105
00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.680
So let's go ahead and keep my finger the P key again.

106
00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.040
And oh, my bad, I had a different key on that particular case.

107
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.480
Let's actually even duplicate so we can grab our pattern and keep my finger on control

108
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.240
D. And then we'll just go ahead and just duplicate what we have before.

109
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.280
That makes things a little bit easier.

110
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:25.000
So let's go ahead now and plug this into an overlay, blend overlay in which we can add

111
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.560
the raindrops.

112
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:37.519
So we'll call a blend overlay underscore overlay.

113
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.519
There we go.

114
00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:39.519
Always forget there's underscore.

115
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.519
There we go.

116
00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:41.519
Right there.

117
00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:49.920
And we're going to grab the raindrops and let's go ahead and grab the ones that we

118
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920
need.

119
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.759
In this particular case, we're using that metal ones again that we pulled in.

120
00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:01.040
And we'll go control D to get it.

121
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.759
Pull the panor in there and pull this into the blend overlay.

122
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:15.160
And we're going to go ahead and add another layer of extra wave movement.

123
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
So move this down.

124
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.200
Move this down too.

125
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.240
So let's go and get that extra wave movement going.

126
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.680
So we're going to grab another texture.

127
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.640
This particular texture is called water waves.

128
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.480
And you'll find that under step five.

129
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.200
So if we go down here, go to step five, you'll see water waves right there.

130
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.800
And I'm going to go and pull that into my scene.

131
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.879
Let's duplicate that pattern one more time.

132
00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:44.160
So do control D and it'll show up wherever my cursor is at.

133
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.640
Reach that right into the UVs there.

134
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.320
And then now let's go ahead and blend this over all and bring it into our roughness.

135
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.160
So we've got a few more nodes.

136
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.080
One will do multiply.

137
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.320
Again, keep my finger the M key and left click there.

138
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.040
And then we'll do like a wave opacity.

139
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.680
So if we want to control this wave opacity, let's do a scalar parameter.

140
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.400
And we'll call this wave opacity.

141
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400
Now again, you can type it in or you hit that S key.

142
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.000
And I'm going to pull that right into the B channel.

143
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.120
And I can keep that as a default as 0.5 and I can choose whether I want to max that out.

144
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.680
So let's go ahead and get the texture sample.

145
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.759
We just need the alpha information.

146
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.600
We don't need it on top of it.

147
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.040
So we're going to go and pull that into the A channel here.

148
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.279
And we'll get the add.

149
00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.680
So let's get that add in there.

150
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.120
So I keep my finger the A key.

151
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
Add.

152
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.720
This is going to make it a little bit more brighter of a highlight.

153
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.600
I'm going to pull the multiply into the B channel.

154
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.800
And then I'm going to grab that blend overlay and pull it into the A channel.

155
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.960
And then now I can move that right into our roughness.

156
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.320
Now it can give us a little bit like an extra like it's like a wet.

157
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.160
Just a little more cartoony and that's fine.

158
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.360
And we can choose how that speed is going to go.

159
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:20.760
So this can give you a little bit more of that almost like that irregular pulsating

160
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.600
feel that you get from water.

161
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.520
The ripples basically is what we're trying to imitate.

162
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.720
And we can add that if we wanted to make a normal for that and add that in there too.

163
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.440
That's really up to you how you want to approach that.

164
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.480
That's it with this video.

165
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.480
And in the next video, we're going to wrap things up with a little more AO and some normals

166
