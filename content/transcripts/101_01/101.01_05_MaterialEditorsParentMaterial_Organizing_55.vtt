00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go and take a look at ways to organize your materials in the material graph

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and how to keep things nice and clean as well as later we're going to look at creating an apparent material and an instance material.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's go and dive in and get started.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One way that you can get organized when working with your materials and how to get things in the right spot

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to prevent over trafficking your noodles basically your strings crossing each other and being all over the place.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't cross the streams as they say in Ghostbusters.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can use add named reroute declaration nodes as well as add a reroute node.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And let me show you how to do that as well as look at some comments that you can actually put into your scene as you're working with your material nodes.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So in real say I have this group of nodes that I've built and we're going to build these later on in another class.

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're primarily going to be focusing on these when we do build them out later.

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But I'm going to pick on these guys for a second because they're a group of nodes that have an ends to a means or I should say a particular node output that we want to convey.

12
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now instead of pulling all the strings to all these different areas we can actually make it go to one particular node and that one particular node can then rest and sit in front of each one of these.

13
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And it's basically naming and rerouting them so you don't have a lot of wires everywhere.

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You can easily do so by right clicking and in here you can type in named reroute declaration node and we can say and call this one UVs.

15
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This UV node can now sit here and I can punch everything into here and then from here I can actually call up the one we made it'll show it right here with Unreal.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I'm just simply left clicking to get this or right clicking I should say to get this to come up and then we're going to click on the name to reroute and click on UVs.

17
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then now if I wanted to I can disconnect this line and go directly into here like so and it does pretty much the same thing.

18
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So that's super helpful and convenient.

19
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You can also say I'm going to just copy these for a second and do control D. Get them in place and I can also collapse nodes whenever I want to.

20
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So I can right click and say collapse these nodes and then you can actually name them whatever you need.

21
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You can say UV set control and that also is very helpful.

22
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now just be aware when you do collapse your nodes and you decide you want to send this material to somewhere else like another project.

23
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you right click and you say hey man I want to go to asset actions and migrate.

24
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
These may not stay together.

25
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They may either be unrecognized or they will just unfold themselves and go back to the original state.

26
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So just be aware that sometimes I get that happening.

27
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It does happen a good amount of time when you go into a new version of Unreal.

28
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So just triple check your workflow.

29
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I think it's less of a problem now but previous versions it kind of was a little bit of an issue.

30
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So we have a way to collapse it.

31
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We can do a name reroute.

32
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We can also reroute in general like say I wanted to connect this particular node to another maybe emissive.

33
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Maybe I like my normal route.

34
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
There's no way out.

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In God's green earth there's no way I would do this but if I wanted to I can double click on any string.

36
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I can move it if my move icon shows up as I float over.

37
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And what this does is it allows me to run another reroute node if I wanted to.

38
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So if I wanted to put this into my emissive it would look horrible.

39
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I can and then you have a glowing normal emissive.

40
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But this allows me to do a simple reroute.

41
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Not a named reroute but a simple one.

42
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And it is a pretty darn good job of being able to do that.

43
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm going to undo that for a second.

44
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You can also group your materials which we'll get into later.

45
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That allows me to select a particular material.

46
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I can go in here and say hey I'm going to choose a group that I wanted to have.

47
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You can type in here under groups in any exposed texture here.

48
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We can actually have that.

49
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Let me show you what I mean.

50
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So I'm going to hit the T key here for a second and left click.

51
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
This is the hot key to be able to give me my texture.

52
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If I wanted a UV texture to show up or UV node I should say it for control.

53
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
That's the U key and you left click also.

54
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There's also a constant you can pull up.

55
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I keep my finger on the one key.

56
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That's a one constant.

57
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That's a two constant.

58
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And then this is a three.

59
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Simply by me hitting one, two, three and left click.

60
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You keep my finger down on those particular numbers.

61
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now I did this for the texture sample here.

62
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
In this texture sample we'll just get something simple.

63
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We'll just pull up the gray.

64
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now by himself you'll notice there is no area to group.

65
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But if we go to the other one, this is called a parameter that's been exposed here,

66
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which allows me to not only change its name but also group it.

67
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So to be able to do that you click on any texture, right click, and you say convert to a parameter.

68
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And then we can give it a name.

69
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We'll call this gray texture.

70
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So there's now gray texture allows me to go in here and if I wanted to type in or give it no group,

71
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but type in, I can type in any group right here and it will now create a new group for this particular texture.

72
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Pretty cool.

73
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Now I'm going to go through as we build our material, our parent material, and our instance material.

74
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I'll walk you through some of the hotkeys to build some of these out just as a reminder.

75
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And so you can get a little more familiar with how to work and build things in Unreal.

76
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And that's about it with this video.
