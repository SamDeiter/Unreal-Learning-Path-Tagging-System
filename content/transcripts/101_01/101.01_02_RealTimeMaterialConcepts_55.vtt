Hi everyone. In this lesson, we're going to go ahead and take a look at the outline for

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.160
this series of videos in which we're going to be discussing how to tackle materials in

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.359
Unreal. And then from there, we're going to go ahead and dive in and talk about what exactly

4
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:22.559
is a Material, PBR, in Unreal in general. So let's get started. So one of the first things

5
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:28.960
we'll talk about is real-time material concepts. What are materials in Unreal and what is PBR,

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520
physically based rendered material? We'll then look at primary nodes and textures,

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.240
look at primary PBR inputs, material settings, and also textures. From there, we're going to

8
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.880
take a look at material editor and parameter materials, look at material editor overview,

9
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:52.079
hotkeys, preview window, material system, blend and light modes, and parent materials and instances.

10
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.000
From there, we'll also look at making materials and parameters, editing materials, animating

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.960
materials we'll go to. And from there, we'll look at diffuse and spec setup for those animations,

12
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.479
pattern node and blending, rough setup, normal setup, and AO setup. And then finally, we'll look

13
00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.319
at the cloth material options and how you can use them to your advantage and how to navigate.

14
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.239
All right, let's go and dive right in.

15
00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.439
Real-time material concepts. So what is a material when it comes to real-time and working with

16
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.079
Unreal? It is essentially an asset applied to a mesh to control its visual look. In its simplest

17
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.239
form, think of it as paint with various properties such as color and finish, and the light reacts to

18
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:45.839
those properties. A material defines how light interacts with the surface it is applied to. You

19
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:50.560
can see here a little demonstration how there'll be some materials that will absorb more light,

20
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.359
and there'll be others with more rough detail added, and there'll be others which are smoother

21
00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:05.119
and more reflective, and which the light will bounce off in on that object. So what is PBR? And

22
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.719
this means a physically based rendering material when it comes to Unreal, and you'll hear me say this

23
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.319
off and on. So it's a unified lighting and shading system that we've developed for Unreal.

24
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.439
It has a better approximation of light in materials and physical interaction, so it really tries to

25
00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.240
capture what's happening in the real world. It's intuitive and consistent, physically accurate,

26
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.240
and uses real-world physical measurements. So PBR is a combination of the materials,

27
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.240
the lighting, and the exposure, and they all come together to sell the idea that this object

28
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.240
is living in this particular virtual world or space. Basically, we've made it so powerful that

29
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.719
we're really trying to push that suspension of disbelief. So you really feel you're there,

30
00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.439
and I'm sure you've felt that at times when you play a video game, and you'll notice looking at the

31
00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:02.240
product of what Unreal brings to the table, and you're like, wow, this looks super hyper-realistic.

32
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.480
And that's kind of what we want to go for. But we also compare things down and make things simplistic

33
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.080
when needed. Well, that's it with this particular video. Here's a link to allow you to dive right in

34
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.560
and get a little bit more understanding of how materials work. And in the next video, we're

35
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.879
going to take a look at the primary nodes and textures and how to work with them in Unreal.

36
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.240
Thanks again.
