00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.759
Hi, everyone. In this lesson, we're going to go ahead and wrap up animating our texture.

2
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:15.759
So let's get started. So in Unreal, we have our scene set up here. So we have a specular,

3
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.839
we have a little bit of exaggeration, a little bit of wave movement. Now, again, we can dumb

4
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.600
this down for the opacity. So if we need this to be a little bit lighter, we can go from

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.879
and we can do this also in the instance material. As we talked about that concept, we can do

6
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.320
0.2 if we wanted to. It's a little bit more subtle. And that actually might work pretty

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.359
well. All right, so let's add or finish up the rest of this. And then what we can do

8
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.640
for fun is add that normal map of that wave when we just made. Now, I didn't give this

9
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.200
to you in the class, but you're more than welcome to make your own normal, whatever you want,

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.640
and put it in. And we're going to look at the different ways you can do that. So first

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.160
up, let's go ahead and add our normal. And we're going to keep it pretty straightforward.

12
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.239
We're not going to get into inverting things and making sure that we can do so if we wanted.

13
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.319
We're going to keep things pretty simple, where we're just going to layer the normals

14
00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:17.719
on top each other. And one of the ways to do that, again, we can use the blend angle.

15
00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:26.159
And you'll see it's called blend angle corrected normals. And again, this guy allows us to

16
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.159
be able to have two normals on top of each other. And it honors them so they don't get

17
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.039
too muddled, they actually blend correctly. And there's no distortion between them. Now,

18
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.679
it does a pretty darn good job of keeping that from getting too distorted. And I actually

19
00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.479
like it pretty well. It's pretty great. I'm going to keep my finger on, I'm going to click

20
00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.959
on the pattern out here, and do control D and duplicate that what we already have. And

21
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.919
we're going to pull up the we need the raindrop normals. Now, if we go back to raindrops,

22
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.839
you'll see that I already have a normal built for you. And we can pull that right into our

23
00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:08.560
scene. So let's pull that normal right here. And we can connect our painter to it. And

24
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.439
then we can put this into our additional normal. And this is the rock normal, and we can make

25
00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.159
that our base normal. And then we can set that right into our scene. Now, if we wanted

26
00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:27.319
to add even more, we can bring in that wave normal that I made. And if we go back up into

27
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.599
step five, you'll see that wave one. Now I made this on my own, you do not have access

28
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.560
to this one, you can simply take him into Photoshop, make a black layer, make him white,

29
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.719
and convert him to a normal. So I'm going to drag him into the scene, I'm just showing

30
00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:47.079
you what you can do if you wanted to stack these. And I can keep these things a little

31
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.000
bit more simple with a multiply. Now, you do want to be careful when doing this, because

32
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.760
if I just kept that as a multiply, the problem we can run into is where our control how strong

33
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.520
that normal is is going to come through. So we would have to go in here and use a lurp

34
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.080
again. And that can be very helpful. So we'll grab this normal put an A channel, put him

35
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.800
into the B channel. And then we can try to go in here and use air, create a scalar parameter.

36
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.000
And we can control that way. Now it's going to overall kind of mute things. So you got

37
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.320
to be careful with that. So another way you can do it is we can bring this into this particular

38
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.560
one into a multiply. And in that multiply, then make a scalar parameter and call this

39
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:46.199
wave normal amount. Got to be able to type that. There you go. So we can even call it

40
00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.800
large wave if you want to do we'll just leave it like wait for now, put it into the B channel,

41
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.159
put this in the A channel, then create a multiply and bring it into here. And that's going to

42
00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.680
be a little bit more macro control versus micro. Now I like having this little micro

43
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.400
control because then I can choose and isolate an effect. Maybe I don't like this as much.

44
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.840
Maybe I like this a bit more. And I want this to be muted compared to it. And that can be

45
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.800
helpful. And then now we can pull this right into our normal and see what we get. And you

46
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.759
can see we get kind of it's a little dark, right? So we are multiplying pretty heavily

47
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.960
on here. If it helps, we can go in here and keep our finger the L key and change our lighting.

48
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:36.239
So it's a little less harsh. You can see the wave effect we got going on when light hits

49
00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:41.399
at a certain way. So we're like, hmm, that waves a little strong. So we'll go in here

50
00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:46.359
with this wave amount. And actually, he's zero right now, let's put one and see what

51
00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:50.319
you get. That's much better. I thought he was already active. There we go. That looks

52
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.500
much better. It is dark because they were overall multiplying a zero, which was given

53
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.359
us like kind of darkness. Actually works pretty well. That's actually not bad. So again,

54
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.520
you can experiment with this any way that you want. We have our drips going through

55
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.840
here and overall kind of wave, you don't necessarily have to have drips with wave. But that's up

56
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.560
to you. So let's go ahead and wrap things up. So a few more things we need to do. Let's

57
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.740
go ahead and kind of do a little bit of the same concept, but a little more simplistic

58
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.199
without obviously the corrective blend, we're going to get these two guys into play and

59
00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:36.120
one of them being the AO and one of them being the cavity. There's the AO, there's a cavity.

60
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.079
And you can determine how you want to stack these, but we can go ahead and move this out

61
00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:45.120
of the way for a second. I'm going to keep my finger the M key and we'll multiply. And

62
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.399
we'll have these guys kind of magnify each other. And what I mean by that is you get

63
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.159
a higher contrast with both of them together and you can see that change here as we zoom

64
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.040
in. So you can get a stronger if you're if you're noticing your AO is not as strong as

65
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.360
you need, but mega scans you notice gave you gave you a cavity map to you can combine them

66
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.600
via the multiply. That's pretty convenient. So let's go and grab the raindrops that we

67
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.120
need. So we need some raindrops that are we able to work well with ours. So let's see,

68
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.680
did I bring in the AO raindrops? Maybe I didn't. Let's go and grab those. And let's pull

69
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.680
this in. And you don't necessarily have to do this last step. But that is up to you how

70
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.959
you want things how strong you want them to be. If you want the raindrops to look like

71
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:33.360
they have a little bit of a shadow, you can maybe go this route. I'm going to go ahead

72
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.079
and keep my finger on control D at the same time and keep my cursor at the area I want

73
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:42.840
it and we'll duplicate what we need. Oops, I grabbed the wrong thing. Let's go back to

74
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.360
Panor is what I meant to do. Control D. We're going to duplicate him over here. And we're

75
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.439
going to move that right into the raindrops, pull that in. And then we'll move and make

76
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.920
we'll make one more multiply, give me a finger the M key left click and pull a string into

77
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.319
the B channel and then pull this texture sample on a channel. And then from here, we can take

78
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:12.960
this into the AO ambient occlusion. And you can highlight some of the dark regions of your

79
00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:20.159
texture and your object. Pretty sweet. We made some moving water texture. And again,

80
00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:24.599
it's up to you if we in this case, we don't really need the metallic. But if you wanted

81
00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.359
to exaggerate things a little more, you could put the metallic in there. You just got to

82
00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:34.039
be careful because you know, the stone isn't really metal. And it may end up being way

83
00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.719
too reflective. It may look like 10. So let's disconnect that real quick, you can see the

84
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.760
difference. And it's a little more realistic without it. But I left it in our scene. So

85
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.040
you can do a comparable if you wanted to. So that's it for animating the materials. Hope

86
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.720
you enjoyed that part of the lecture. And the next video, we're going to talk about you

87
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.520
working with alphas and bringing things such as torn clothes into a scene and some of the

88
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.920
nodes and options we have for that. Thanks again.
