00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.839
Hi everyone, in this video we're going to go ahead and animate a material in Unreal.

2
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.500
I'll show you how to connect all the nodes and get everything set up so we can have a

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.839
nice believable animation in our scene.

4
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.820
So let's get started.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.080
So in this video we're probably going to break this up in a couple of videos here because

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
it is a few things you need to consider and there's a lot of options I want to be able

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.359
to point out so you can actually see the power and the ability you have to create what you

8
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.359
need in Unreal.

9
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.780
So we do have a sample material so anytime you are following along and you're like, hey

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.719
I want to see where Sean connected that and how did he get that to work, you can simply

11
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.000
go to this material here or this one that they're both the same and select them in our

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.280
Details panel and click on the magnifying glass to the folder.

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.640
This will take you directly to the sample material.

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.519
See it says it is under the folder called step 5.

15
00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.200
So you can go ahead and double click on that and you can get an idea and pull up the material

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.320
as I'm working and you'll be able to follow along and you'll see that I have active notes

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.820
in here.

18
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.359
So let's go ahead and build a similar material.

19
00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:11.280
We're going to be using kind of the same textures and that's fine within our scene.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.079
So I'm going to go ahead to our content folder and I'm going to go ahead and go into our

21
00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.920
class materials and we're going to make a new material.

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.600
So I'm going to go ahead and create material here.

23
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:29.759
I'm going to go and click on this and in material we will call this one M underscore animate

24
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.239
in CLL.

25
00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.239
There we go.

26
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:40.239
So we're going to go ahead and animate this guy and let's go and double click on that material.

27
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:45.639
Let's drag him into our view here so we can see the whole thing and we want to go ahead

28
00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.560
and grab the textures that we need.

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.320
Now some of the textures we're going to need, it can be any texture that you choose.

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.640
It doesn't have to be the ones that I have, but you'll notice in the Megascans we have

31
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.280
several different surfaces we can choose from.

32
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.159
If we open up surfaces you'll see we have wet stone ground.

33
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.320
You can use that one if you want to.

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.640
There's river stone and that's pretty much the one we're going to be focusing on is the

35
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.640
river stone.

36
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.199
So I'm going to go ahead and grab a few things here.

37
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.199
I'm going to grab my albedo.

38
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:17.879
I'm going to grab my AO just in case you want to punch some things into the AO as well as

39
00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:23.919
maybe even mess with some metallic because this thing really doesn't have metallic, but

40
00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:29.519
we could use the AO for that slot in this particular case just to fake a few things.

41
00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.159
So I'm going to go ahead and for that note I'm also grab the cavity because maybe I want

42
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.319
to use that one instead and I could even use this place which is a little more dramatic

43
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.319
than the two.

44
00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.280
I'm going to go ahead and grab the normal and I'm going to grab the roughness and I'll

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.840
also grab the specular because I might want to make this a little more highlighted to

46
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.840
make it a little more wet and we're going to go ahead and pull those into our scene.

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.719
Now you'll see there's a few others.

48
00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.599
You'll see like there's gloss which can be used for spec.

49
00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.360
You'll see that there's bump and this also could be used in different a variety of things

50
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.240
depending on how strong it is.

51
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.159
You could even have that as your AO.

52
00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.560
Say you forgot to bake out the AO, you could use bump.

53
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.759
It's really up to you how you produce your textures and how what your DCC is for your

54
00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:20.240
texture development like maybe you're using maybe Substance 3D.

55
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.719
We do have a plugin for that too so you can go into the plugins and pull and turn on our

56
00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.800
Substance 3D but you got to make sure you go to their website to make sure you're getting

57
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.879
the latest one to be able to get that to work and make sure you're installed into Unreal.

58
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.879
Just want to give that quick call out to that because we do have tools to be able to accommodate

59
00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.120
because not everything's built exactly the same.

60
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.319
When it comes to Megascans you can choose different things that you want like you could load your

61
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.080
cavity map and you can combine it with your AO to exaggerate some highlights and etc.

62
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.879
So you can set this up anyway that you see fit.

63
00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.000
Alright so now that we have that stuff set up here let's go ahead and get our initial

64
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640
texture set up the way that we want.

65
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.319
So we're not going to do anything fancy with the Elbido so I'm simply just going to grab

66
00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.800
this and punch it right into the base color.

67
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.000
We just need this guy present and let's set this to a cube.

68
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.719
Now you'll notice my interface here in the previous videos that we had we were working

69
00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.480
in 5.5 and this one I just kind of shifted to 5.6 just for the ending part so just so

70
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.519
you can get familiar to some of the icons I'm referring to.

71
00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:26.480
In 5.5 you'll find out that the icons were down below when it came to your view are a

72
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.319
little 3D interactive viewer in here but you'll find them up here now when it comes to 5.6.

73
00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.519
And that's okay they're just small minor changes but I just want to point that out if you are

74
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:44.159
following along and you'll see that this hey wait a minute this isn't 5.5 well I'm kind

75
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.759
of doing this one this section in 5.6.

76
00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.680
Alright so we have this texture here let's go ahead and bring in the appropriate texture

77
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.240
that we can work with and in this case we can use gloss.

78
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.600
Now if you didn't grab gloss initially you'll see that we have cavity and you'll see that

79
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.480
we have roughness and you'll see that we have specular.

80
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.800
You can simply just go down here and it doesn't you don't have to have the same one to one

81
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.520
that I have if you don't for this particular slot where we're messing with metallic so

82
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.759
if you wanted to use gloss you can you don't have to you can use any one of these like

83
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.240
maybe even displacement so I'm going to pull up gloss and pull them in here and again the

84
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.720
thing you have to keep in mind if we are putting metallic on a non-metallic surface just be

85
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.040
aware that you can exaggerate things in in an area that you may like but it also may

86
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.760
push and pull things in an area you may not like and what I mean by that is you may get

87
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.160
too too much reflectivity so you can dumb that down and adjust your values accordingly.

88
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.760
Alright so let's go in here and plug this in so we're going to move albedo up a little

89
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.960
bit higher we're going to move this one over and again you can I'm not for this particular

90
00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.680
lesson going to convert to parameter because you get the idea how to do that but you can

91
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.479
do that if you and I do recommend if you want to make changes on the fly let's go and keep

92
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.159
my finger on the M key in the child instance and let's go ahead and keep my finger on the

93
00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:13.279
S key and left click so I'm I'm I'm again keeping my finger on that key and left clicking

94
00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:17.759
to pull those up and I called up a scalar parameter which you saw me do earlier so let's get the

95
00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:24.279
scalar parameter and set this to metal amount and again you don't have to do metal but I'm

96
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.439
going to show you the values of width on without and that can complement things depending

97
00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:34.079
on the surface and the color values and the dark and light on an object some things may

98
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:38.599
not eat it some things may you may need to push that that little reflectivity a little

99
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.879
bit farther so I'm going to go ahead and grab this texture sample and I'm going to pull

100
00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.959
that string into the a channel I'm going to grab that metal value and I keep it at zero

101
00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:53.159
for now I'm going to pull that into the B channel now what we want to do is make some movement

102
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.360
going on here so we're going to have to grab another texture now this can be any type of

103
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.800
raindrop raindrops that you've chosen that you've made maybe you've edited on your own

104
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.879
it's up to you but I'm going to show you where you can get ours because we do have them available

105
00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:16.160
you'll see underneath our folder underneath step five we have a folder called raindrops

106
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.680
so in raindrops we're going to go ahead and grab a few things for one we're going to grab

107
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.759
this particular one if we wanted to we could even grab this darker one if you wanted to

108
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.079
it's really up to you but I found this one that's a little more grayed out kind of a

109
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:36.319
smoother kind of drop effect here this one works a little bit better than this one and

110
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:41.199
it makes it less harsh between the contrasting and that's one thing you also have to be careful

111
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:45.199
and keep in mind if you're combining textures and stacking them on top of each other and

112
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:50.360
then plugging them into like a stronger value which maybe didn't exist in a rock such as

113
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.160
metal you might want to consider smoothing some of the values out and maybe using lighter

114
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.480
contrasting black and white textures so that's what I'm doing here so I'm going to go and

115
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.240
create an ad keep my finger the a key left click and I'm going to pull this string from

116
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.840
this particular raindrop into the B channel and I'm going to go ahead and grab the multiply

117
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.600
and put it into the A channel and we're going to have to need some movement here so let's

118
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.360
go ahead and create a panor so if you're not familiar with the panor node the panor node

119
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.720
allows us to be able to actually make motion from up down and even sideways if we punch

120
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.920
in the correct X and Y type of coordinates so I keep my finger the peakie left click

121
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.360
there we go we got panor now if I again if I wanted to move a little bit more to the

122
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.639
side I would mess with both these values but I really just want to be messing with the

123
00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:42.759
Y channel value and in this particular case you can choose the speed I'm going to choose

124
00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:50.120
a negative one there you go and I'm going to go ahead and punch that into my raindrops

125
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.679
if you want you can preview by right clicking and we can start preview mode to see what

126
00:08:54.679 --> 00:09:00.279
it's going to look like that's a pretty good pace and I have it so that it's tiling so

127
00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:06.720
we can go ahead and stop the preview and then we can go and punch that right into the metallic

128
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.720
and see what we get now we see this is what I like about it using it if I'm using a metallic

129
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.279
here that smooth makes it so it's not so harsh on the stone but you'll see movement over

130
00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:24.000
the stone of the dark and light and you can change that if you wanted to if I wanted to

131
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
maybe I want the gray to be on the drops versus the white being on the surface and you got

132
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.720
to be careful with that because I want the white to be more reflective and you can see

133
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.080
it's slightly reflective in here not a whole lot because I don't have other values you

134
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.840
see a little bit better on the darker side but it's really up to you and this is what

135
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:52.639
you could do you could do like a one minus if you wanted to you can do one minus and

136
00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:56.320
then we can flip that value now we get get into the one minus note a little bit more

137
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.560
in the other class after this but this shows you what you could do if you wanted to flip

138
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.600
it a little bit more and you can see that you can have it so actually that's actually

139
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.920
not too bad it gives you more of a higher reflective maybe type of look to it there

140
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:15.240
but again it's trying to use the texture that we have set in and it's really up to you what

141
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.039
you want to produce in your scene and that's actually not too shabby I think I kind of

142
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:24.240
like that alright so we'll leave that in there for now but we do get into that a little bit

143
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:34.879
more use of that into the other class so this is our initial setup what we want to do in

144
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:38.159
the next video is we're going to go ahead and elaborate on this a little bit farther

145
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.679
and we're going to push things a little bit more so we can get kind of the water effect

146
00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:43.879
that we want to need thanks again
