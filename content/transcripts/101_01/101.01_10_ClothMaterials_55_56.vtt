00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go ahead and take a look at how to create

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:13.040
a cloth material and create materials with textures that have alpha information.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.480
So let's get started.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.600
In our scene in Unreal, on the last part of our lecture, you'll see that I have an object

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.640
in our 3D space here, in Unreal that actually has some alpha information in it.

6
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.920
I'm going to show you how to get this to be active, and some of the other options you

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.399
can do to be able to make this a cloth alpha object in which you get the settings for

8
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.719
a fuzz color and a cloth option.

9
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.240
Now each one of these gives you the ability to be able to change things a little bit,

10
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.519
but you don't necessarily have to use it, but the option is there.

11
00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.159
We're going to talk a little bit of the difference between them.

12
00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.839
You'll see that cloth is an input that enables you to control the strength of the fuzz color

13
00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.279
as a mask.

14
00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.359
The fuzz color, which you'll see in just a minute, this enables you to add color to

15
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.560
your material, to simulate shifts in color when light passes through.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.400
Now again, you're simulating it, so it's not going to necessarily be 100% true, and also

17
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
you have to be careful these two can mute each other out.

18
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.039
I'll do an example as you can see it up close.

19
00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.319
Let's go and take a look at this material.

20
00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:23.439
Then we're going to go ahead and make a simplified version of this material.

21
00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.559
We're going to go back and look at some of the dependencies this material may run into.

22
00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:32.799
I'm going to go and click on this object in 3D space, and I'm going to go to my cloth

23
00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.159
completed and double click on that.

24
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.159
We see that our material pops up.

25
00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.879
We already have it active, but you can go in here and find the textures for cloth that

26
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:49.679
we have in place, and you can find some of the materials that we have active.

27
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.960
You can simply do that by hitting the magnifying glass, and you'll see under step four, it

28
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.760
says cloth sample.

29
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.440
Let's go ahead and look at this up close.

30
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.200
So to be able to make this material, I've selected the blend mode of masked.

31
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.840
This is used whenever we want to have alpha information to be read, and we can punch it

32
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.520
into our opacity mask.

33
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.879
But I've also added shading model cloth.

34
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.079
Now this is an option which gives you again that same fuzz color option as well as cloth

35
00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.079
option.

36
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.439
Let's go to the slides for a moment, and we'll talk about this a little bit more in depth.

37
00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.639
So the shading model cloth simulates a fuzz layer and will produce more realistic results

38
00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.639
for cloth.

39
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.680
Now you do got to be careful because fuzz color and cloth can mute each other, so you

40
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.240
have to get the values just right.

41
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.280
So we're going to get a simplified version up close and compare it with this more complicated

42
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
version.

43
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.800
Again, the fuzz color, this input enables you to add color to your material to simulate

44
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.400
the shifts of color when light passes through it.

45
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.439
And cloth, although you know you're like wiser cloth note inside of cloth might seem a little

46
00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.280
bit redundant, but this input enables you to control the strength of the fuzz.

47
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.480
It probably should be called fuzz color, but we left it as cloth and uses it as a mask

48
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.919
and value of zero indicates no fuzz color contribution to the base color, whereas a

49
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.120
value of one blends fully over the base color.

50
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.000
Now you can put color information in here if you wanted to, but primarily you're going

51
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.719
to probably want to use a scalar parameter to be able to get more out of it because it's

52
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.120
a very it's a very linear node.

53
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.599
Let's go and jump it back into Unreal and take a look at this up close.

54
00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.719
So in our material, this is the one that's already in the scene.

55
00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.599
I have things pretty set up, set up pretty simple.

56
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.519
And I'm just pulling color information into the fuzz color and fuzz cloth.

57
00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.799
If I disconnect some of these, say we'll disconnect cloth, you'll notice that a whole lot happens,

58
00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.799
right?

59
00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.879
Because it's looking for a number value.

60
00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.599
This is what I meant before, but we also have fuzz color.

61
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.199
So if we go down here and say we get fuzz color information and bring this up, we can now

62
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.799
punch this into our fuzz color.

63
00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.000
And you'll see if we increase the strength a bit more, you'll see these values get a

64
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.399
little bit strong over the surface.

65
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:24.639
Now our cloth, remember when I said they depend on each other and they can mute each other

66
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.639
out.

67
00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.680
Well, if I go in here, I could either put a scalar parameter like say I'm going to detach

68
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.319
this and bring this around.

69
00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.920
I can punch it in here or put in a scalar parameter, just put the numbers in or just

70
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.240
do it this way.

71
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.079
And then you'll see the strength kind of shine through.

72
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.240
So this is what I meant that you got to kind of find a happy medium of what you want.

73
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.159
I'm going to set this to one and maybe even a point five, but you'll notice it is muted

74
00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.959
in a little bit, but not maybe to the amount that we want.

75
00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:59.879
That's when we have to go into the fuzz color and go in here and maybe lower this at least

76
00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.240
half or at least down to maybe 10.

77
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.879
Then we can even go to like two and maybe even one.

78
00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:14.000
Now this color is making it so that we're imitating a fuzz type of look.

79
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.800
So if you need to mute things even more, you can do it with the amount or just simply change

80
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.319
the color closer to your original object.

81
00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.360
So if I move this a little more closer to blue and hit OK, you can see that it's a little

82
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.160
bit closer to what we have.

83
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.680
And it has kind of almost like a haze fuzz look on here as it relates to the light.

84
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.560
So it's almost like using kind of a Furnal Index type of approach to give us a simulated

85
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.120
fuzz look to our object.

86
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.600
Our fuzz color then can go in here and we can set this maybe 0.2, lower that, and you

87
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.400
can see now it's muting things a little more believable and the fact that we can see the

88
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.600
results a little bit clearer.

89
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.080
And we can go to maybe five if you wanted to.

90
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.140
All this we can use with a scalar parameter.

91
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.180
And the cloth primarily is going to be driven by numbers.

92
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.539
Now if we went in here and said, Hey, man, I'm going to go and put a color in here.

93
00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.539
You'll notice that information is going to be kind of muting each other.

94
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.620
And this is what I meant by you probably just want to put some numbers in here because these

95
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.060
dependencies will influence each other.

96
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.060
And this is primarily being driven by numbers as it says in my notes.

97
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.579
Now if we look at a simplistic version, if I go to my content browser, we can go in here

98
00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:33.459
and underneath our intro to materials, we're going to go and go to our in class material,

99
00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.459
we're going to right click in here and make a new material.

100
00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.899
I'll keep this pretty simplistic.

101
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.899
So I'm going to go M underscore cloth.

102
00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.139
Got to be able to spell cloth.

103
00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.139
That was class.

104
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.939
I think that's like Scottish for cloth.

105
00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:50.459
So cloth sample.

106
00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:56.779
And I'm going to double click on that.

107
00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.019
So again, we're messing with blend mode and shading model.

108
00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.500
Now you don't necessarily have to use the shading model.

109
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.459
Again that gives fuzz and cloth to be able to be accept accessible.

110
00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:13.659
But I'm going to switch this mainly blend mode into our mask.

111
00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:16.939
And that mask is now going to give us an opacity mask.

112
00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.339
Now it doesn't open up opacity.

113
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:24.699
It does if we go to the previous material, you'll see we do have an opacity set in here

114
00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:30.060
that controls a translucency of the material when substrate is enabled.

115
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.819
This actually can work with substrate as well.

116
00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:37.059
So you have kind of like an alpha composite blend situation that you could use this if

117
00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:38.939
you needed it.

118
00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.019
But over here, we just need it because we simply just turn on mask.

119
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:44.859
We have our opacity mask active.

120
00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:50.340
Now we can drive this with numbers or even try to drive it a little bit with a texture.

121
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.900
But for the most part, you're going to see some values on some of these by default.

122
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.699
But obviously just like rough and spec, you can put in a black and white kind of value

123
00:07:58.699 --> 00:07:59.699
in there.

124
00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.939
And we can do the same with some of those.

125
00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:04.300
Now right now, again, we're just using simple mask.

126
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.300
And we just have an opacity mask set up and ready to go.

127
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.860
What I'm going to do now is go in here and go to my control, go to my content browser,

128
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.220
excuse me, and we're going to go ahead and get that cloth texture that we need.

129
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:25.379
Now this is where our cloth is at, but we need to go ahead and grab that rip cloth or materials

130
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.180
at we need to grab that texture.

131
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.500
So I'm just going to pull on these simple PNG that I have.

132
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.139
It has already has an alpha embedded.

133
00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:36.700
So I'm going to pull in the RGB to the base color and then I'm going to grab that alpha

134
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.860
information and put it right into the opacity mask.

135
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.060
So I'm not driving numbers for this one.

136
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.259
I'm simply pulling in my health information to it.

137
00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.700
Now you'll notice it's not rendering on both sides.

138
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.780
So when that happens, especially if you have a draped cloth or maybe your character has

139
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.460
a cape of some kind, you want to be able to see both sides.

140
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.540
So in that, let's click on the grid and in this material, we want to go to the details

141
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.500
and turn on two sided.

142
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.460
And that'll give it so that we have both sides to our cloth object.

143
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.379
In more advanced classes, we talk about how to actually have it so you can render two

144
00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:18.000
different types of textures on either side of that.

145
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.820
But in this case, such as like with a leaf, but in this particular case, we just want

146
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.940
to keep it simple.

147
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.740
So you can get a little info on the introduction of this.

148
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.139
And you can see that we've made a simple masked object, our texture.

149
00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:35.100
And then we open up the parameters in the material to be able to get that texture that

150
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.899
read make the material to be able to read that textures alpha information.

151
00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:45.379
And we have it all set up pretty quickly.

152
00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.939
In the lecture notes, I walk you through step by step how to mess with these and to plug

153
00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:52.360
them into where you want them to be.

154
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.480
It's really up to you how you want to play and experiment with Unreal.

155
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.680
But we give you the tools to be able to you to be able to customize any look that you

156
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.879
want and feel as necessary for your game or linear content.

157
00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:10.519
In the slides, you'll see a link to get more information on this.

158
00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:16.039
And you'll find this also not only with 5.5, but 5.6 to get a breakdown of how to work

159
00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:22.060
with these materials and textures and to get things in the right direction.

160
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.060
