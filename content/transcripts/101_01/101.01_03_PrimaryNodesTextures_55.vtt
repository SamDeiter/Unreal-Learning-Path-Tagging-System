00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to look at some primary nodes and textures when

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.040
it comes to working with materials in Unreal.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.400
So let's get started.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.640
So some of the primary nodes we're going to be looking at is the base color, metallic,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.600
specular, and roughness.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.519
Later on we'll talk about emissive and we'll talk about some of the others like ambient

7
00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.519
occlusion.

8
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.120
But for the most part we're going to focus on these four initially.

9
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:33.120
And you'll see in our little sample image here that we have some little numbers here.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.600
These are our constants.

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.719
These constants are punched into each one of these particular variable options inside

12
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.079
of our material.

13
00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.359
Now the thing about these is these can be constants where they're just a singular number, they're

14
00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:52.040
just resting in here, something you set and just keep on going on with your material workflow,

15
00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.799
or they can be turned into a exposed as a scalar parameter or create a scalar parameter

16
00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.920
out to get go and plug it in.

17
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.359
Now I'll show you how to do that because there's a quick way to do it where you just promote

18
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.400
a parameter for each one of these.

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.680
But this is the initial ones we'll be looking at within our material editor and then we're

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.439
also going to be looking at some textures here in just a second.

21
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.439
So let me point this out real quick in Unreal and we'll go back into the texture concepts.

22
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.120
So in Unreal we're just going to click on this material, one pic on this guy, and I'm

23
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.599
going to double click on it and bring him up.

24
00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.060
This is a thing called a material instance.

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.799
This is just a child of the parent.

26
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.200
We'll talk about that concept in just a bit.

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.239
But I want to go ahead and go into the parent material here.

28
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.840
I'm going to double click on it.

29
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.079
And you can see now we have these base materials active.

30
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.799
You'll see we have a base, we have a metallic, we have a specular and we have a rough.

31
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.039
But you'll also see that there's a number of variables so you can punch in those ahead

32
00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.039
of time if you wanted to.

33
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840
And you wouldn't even have to actually connect anything.

34
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.760
Now what I meant by promoting, you can simply right click and say promote to parameter.

35
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.800
This turns it into a scalar parameter.

36
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.360
And when you do, this scalar parameter has a definite default, a slide minimum, and a

37
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.120
slider maximum, as well as you can categorize it into a particular group.

38
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.520
And you'll see there's groups already have set up here.

39
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.319
But I just wanted to point that out what that's all about.

40
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm going to disconnect this by simply clicking on the connection node and keeping my finger

41
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.840
on the Alt key and that actually automatically disconnects.

42
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.359
We're going to do a full walkthrough of the interface here in just a bit, but I wanted

43
00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.039
to show some things quickly in context.

44
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.639
Let's go ahead and talk about texturing and we'll get back to these concepts later.

45
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.799
So our base color, Elbido, is a flat color without specular or shading.

46
00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.400
We have a linear RGB vector three values of zero to one.

47
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.039
And we want to avoid pure black and pure white because they just don't show up in nature.

48
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.959
Now then again, if you have a stylized piece you're working on, you may lean in that area

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.120
because you just need to push those values.

50
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.320
But for the most part, for realism, you're not going to you're kind of kind of shy away

51
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320
from that.

52
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320
We're there.

53
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.640
We're trying really hard with science seems to be getting closer to pure black and pure

54
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
white.

55
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240
But for the most part, you're not going to see that.

56
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.680
Metallic here is a grayscale value that ranges from zero to one.

57
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.280
Most common usage is an honor off state.

58
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.000
So one or zero.

59
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.640
When I want one, it deals 100% specular reflection and zero is going to be zero going to be none

60
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.920
and anything in between is going to be a variant of them.

61
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.639
And you can see the full scale spectrum here.

62
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.519
You can see it has hardly any and then we can see that it's fully metallic.

63
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.519
Actually not, I should say.

64
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.119
And in the middle, it's kind of in between.

65
00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:32.479
And then we have roughness grayscale value that ranges from zero to one also, but it

66
00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:39.199
ranges from smooth mirror like surface zero to a rougher matte surface, which is one.

67
00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.519
Unlike both metallic, you're encouraged to fine tune the roughness value between zero

68
00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.239
and one or use a texture to that effect.

69
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.000
So using no texture keeps the material slightly lighter.

70
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.280
Again, this depends on resolution.

71
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.900
This depends how many times you're using input values versus an actual texture.

72
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
This really just depends on what your overall scene is going to be.

73
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.020
They can add up after a while if you decide to just use numbers.

74
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.000
But for the most part, you're going to use roughness as a texture.

75
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.640
Let me give you an example.

76
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.920
If I had a really old piece of leather, I would have a high roughness value in there

77
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.879
to demonstrate how the variance change between the light and the old dollar parts of that

78
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.879
leather.

79
00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.120
And the same thing with rusty metal versus shiny metal, you can use roughness values

80
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.319
for that.

81
00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.199
Using a range, obviously it's not a specific, but using a texture is going to be very specific

82
00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.479
to sell the concept.

83
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.000
So specular grayscale value that ranges from zero to one.

84
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.240
So good rule of thumb is to set the specular value to 0.5 and fine tune it.

85
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.360
Now a lot of times what I'll do is I'll turn my specular all the way to zero.

86
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.079
I'll turn it off and let my roughness push the values.

87
00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:47.560
The only time I'd fire up my specular, if I need to push a particular look, which we're

88
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.480
going to do later, such as super shiny, over the top wetness, that's where you can actually

89
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
bring in specular.

90
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.680
But you've got to be careful because roughness and specular can influence each other and

91
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.240
they can turn each other off or mute each other if you're not careful.

92
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.079
So what I like to do just for a good rule of thumb, I turn specular to zero and I focus

93
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.500
mostly on my rough.

94
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
So guidelines.

95
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.960
When you're building your texture, you want to try to use a power of two.

96
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.600
The reason why you want to is that makes it so the Mipmaps are working accordingly.

97
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.280
And the Mipmaps are kind of your LOD, you can think of it that way, level of detail for

98
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.680
your texture.

99
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.480
And you can do 16 by 16 or you can even go as high as 8,000, 8K if you wanted to.

100
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.240
And the textures don't have to be squares, you can have something like a 2048 by 1024

101
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.759
or a 2048 by 4096, you can definitely do that.

102
00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.759
And that's really up to you.

103
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.640
But you got to keep that thing, you got to keep that in mind that power of two is what

104
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.120
you want to hit, because then you can control that Mipmap if you need to edit it, like smooth

105
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.960
it out, make it blurry.

106
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.960
And for some reason you have a repeating pattern and it isn't quite reading right and you're

107
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.759
getting more patterns happening.

108
00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.879
So texture pyramid, let's look at speaking of Mipmaps.

109
00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.399
Let's talk about that for a second.

110
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.399
So let's jump into Unreal.

111
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:09.879
I'm going to go ahead and take a look at this Megascans material.

112
00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.399
Just click on the magnifying glass for the folder if you're wondering how we got here.

113
00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:18.639
And I'm going to double click on the salt mine here, wall, I'm going to double click

114
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.759
on the texture for it.

115
00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.240
And I'll just pick on the albedo so you can get an idea of what we can do.

116
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.959
Now obviously I can roll mouse in and out with my wheel mouse here.

117
00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.800
You'll notice we have RGB channels that we can take a look at.

118
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.360
This is super helpful if you're inheriting a texture you may not be familiar.

119
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.920
And you know that they've painted in the channels you can see where the channels are

120
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.040
at and what they do.

121
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.360
This again just shows us all the different channels for that particular piece of texture.

122
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.240
And over here you'll see that we have our Mipmap Gen settings.

123
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.560
And you'll see it says texture group.

124
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.400
Now the time that you would mess with these or edit these if you're getting some display

125
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.879
issues that aren't quite working out.

126
00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.759
Case in point say you have a chain link fence or you have a roof that is a repeating pattern

127
00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.639
you might want to blur it or sharpen it.

128
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.599
If you're getting a more a pattern or a very weird distortion happening, you can actually

129
00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.920
use these settings here to be able to change that if you need to.

130
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.319
Now you'll notice there's an LOD bias.

131
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.599
We're not going to really mess with this one, but as the bias is to the index of the top

132
00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:21.319
MIP level to use, that is the number of MIP levels to drop when cooking.

133
00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.279
So overall you have a zero by default and you kind of want to keep it there, but you

134
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.599
do have the option to change that if you need to.

135
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.560
And for some reason you need to customize it for a particular device such as a phone

136
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.680
or iPad and those change whether they're high level iPads or lower level.

137
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.960
You have the options to be able to customize all of this to be able to do so.

138
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.920
You'll notice there's a texture group though.

139
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.160
This is a world because this is a texture that's isn't particular to a set of UVs.

140
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.560
This is something you put on the wall so it's considered world.

141
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560
And you can change this.

142
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.960
You can say, hey, this goes to weapon.

143
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960
This goes to vehicle.

144
00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:59.599
And the reason why you do this is helps with compiling your shader.

145
00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:04.319
And ultimately when you send things out the door to be packaged, you're actually telling

146
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.839
Unreal what to look at first.

147
00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.759
So it doesn't have to pick walk through everything else.

148
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.719
So you're kind of just isolating.

149
00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.359
So we got an advanced area here too.

150
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:16.079
This allows you to control some of your downscaling if you needed to.

151
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:20.639
And again, all of these are mainly to control whether you're going to, you know, maybe you

152
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.079
need to adjust the compression.

153
00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:26.079
You know, maybe you need to never stream this.

154
00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.439
Maybe it doesn't need to stream.

155
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.639
All these things are in here so that when you build out your texture and you need to

156
00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.480
edit things by default, all this should work just great.

157
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.319
But there are times when you will need to change things such as compression.

158
00:08:37.319 --> 00:08:43.039
Now later on in another class that we have, I'll demonstrate and point out that there's

159
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.639
an option to be able to change these if you need to say, hey, I need something to be really

160
00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:55.679
high end HDR, maybe have a series of images I want to project on a wall or on a geometry,

161
00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.600
you can actually choose that.

162
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.559
And also you can say I want to clean it up a little bit so there's less blurring on some

163
00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.559
of my alpha areas.

164
00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:06.759
So you can choose any of these to be able to help out what you want to do for your particular

165
00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:09.159
texture.

166
00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:12.840
And these really do come in handy after a while.

167
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.519
You notice there's more advanced here.

168
00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:19.039
We can control some of our maximum texture size for this.

169
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:22.199
You're like, hey, I don't want this texture to go any higher than this.

170
00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:25.480
You can control kind of a compression setting if you need to.

171
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.799
And that actually makes it so that you're resolutionally hits a particular amount.

172
00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.000
So there's a lot of options.

173
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.279
Now I'm not going to go into about knowledge here because not all of these will necessarily

174
00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:41.399
be necessary, but they are available for you to explore more if you need to customize your

175
00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:44.000
texture and make sure everything is performant.

176
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.639
For the most part, if you're keeping in mind what your hero objects are and your objects

177
00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:52.399
in the background and you're keeping those resolutions maintained and using virtual texturing,

178
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.399
you may not even have to dive into these very much at all.

179
00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:58.240
But they are available because we want you to feel drunk with power.

180
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.120
We want you to be able to customize things the way that you need for your project.

181
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.600
So these are available here.

182
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.200
You'll notice there's also a brightness and brightness curve, vibrance and saturation.

183
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200
We have these set here.

184
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.240
I recommend if you are going to mess with these.

185
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.120
Now you do get an arrow that says, hey, send me back to default, but I would recommend

186
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.639
you make a copy of your texture and then try to play with these.

187
00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:22.680
That way you can do a comparable between whether you like the new version or the old version.

188
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.039
And that can be pretty helpful.

189
00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:29.960
And at the end, you'll see here there's file path compositing and a few other advanced

190
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.759
things, but we're not going to get into those just yet, but they are available here for

191
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:37.279
you again for full customization.

192
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:43.519
Now we can use the import button in our scene if we want to, but we can also go in here

193
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.639
and you can simply drag in a texture that you need.

194
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:49.639
Let me demonstrate and unreal really quick because there's several ways to bring in what

195
00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:51.639
you want.

196
00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.360
Say in my scene, I need to bring in a emergency sign.

197
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.839
I need to bring it in and I need to use it for my scene.

198
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.759
Now I can do an import here.

199
00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:04.839
You'll see here I can look for it on fab if I need to also.

200
00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:10.480
There's a hot key for fab or hot button, I should say, or I can simply just open up the

201
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.680
folder where that icon is at and just simply drag it into my scene.

202
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680
So.

203
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.680
And it import is done.

204
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.639
You can see, hey, look, now I have a sign in here.

205
00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:29.120
Now I do need to change the unreal is nice and will order any kind of weird name.

206
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.960
I just got this from the internet, but you do want to try to name this so that it's a

207
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.160
little bit more catering to unreal's naming scheme.

208
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.280
And I mean that by putting underscores where you can.

209
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.160
And we can just put this as a T for texture in the very front.

210
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.280
Cool.

211
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.519
So there's a couple ways that you can import things and those are two of them and makes

212
00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:55.160
your life a bit simpler.

213
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.660
That's it with this lecture.

214
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.759
Here's a link below to dive deeper into this particular topic.

215
00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:04.559
In the next video, we're going to take a look at material editor overall and we're going

216
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:08.360
to look at parent materials and how to work with those workflows.

217
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.840
Thanks again.
