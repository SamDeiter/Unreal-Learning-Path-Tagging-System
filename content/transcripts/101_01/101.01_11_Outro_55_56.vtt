00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
Thanks again for joining us on learning more about how to create materials in our introductory

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.439
course on creating them and using them in Unreal.

3
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.700
We covered different aspects of materials to consider and think about when it comes

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.519
to roughness and metallic, grouping those materials and putting them in the appropriate

5
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.879
areas for organization and some of the tools to be able to view things the way that you

6
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.920
would want.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.880
We also talked about looking at animated materials, how to animate them in a scene,

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.520
how to get them to look and feel a bit more realistic based on your settings and the inputs

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.760
you put in.

10
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.400
And then finally, we looked at creating alpha information or getting alpha information from

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.240
our textures and punching them into a material in Unreal to get the believability of cloth

12
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.480
and things with alpha data that we can use and manipulate to the looks that we need.

13
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.000
Thanks again for joining us on this little adventure and learning about Unreal and getting

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.680
an introduction to materials.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.280
I'm sure you're going to have a blast and trust me when I say it's pretty addictive.

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.560
Thanks again.
