00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to look at some primary hotkeys working with

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.879
the Material Editor.

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.200
From there we're going to go ahead and look at some different ways you can organize even

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.679
more using Unreal.

5
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.320
And then we're going to create a parent material and some instance materials and open up some

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
parameters for editing.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.719
So let's get started.

8
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.879
Here are some primary hotkeys we're going to be mainly working with in this particular

9
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.359
lesson as well as other lessons when it comes to talking about materials.

10
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.039
Now you heard me talk about how the number one key gives us a variable constant.

11
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.960
We have a number two gives us another variable constant.

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.759
This gives us color information on this particular one.

13
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.920
And three and four as well as a power node.

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.159
There's a reflection vector as well as a texture sample which you saw me also hit the

15
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.799
T key to get a texture sample to come up.

16
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.719
The U key for texture coordinates.

17
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.240
We have a B for Bump Offset node which will go over in other classes.

18
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.679
We have a Normalize node and M for Multiply which you'll see me use quite often in this

19
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.560
series of classes.

20
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.840
And we have a Duplicate.

21
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.120
We have a L for the LURP which we'll talk in more detail about how the LURP works later

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.319
on in other classes and a little bit in this one.

23
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:19.239
And then we also have the Paner as well as the Scalar parameter which is basically a exposed

24
00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.680
parameter of a simple variable constant.

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.000
The one key.

26
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.680
Alright, let's go and jump into Unreal and I'm going to show you some other things you

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.280
can do to organize your scene as well as let's go ahead and make a parent material and then

28
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.640
convert that parent material or I should say create an instance material from it.

29
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.920
Now let's go ahead and jump into Unreal here and take a look at creating our own parent

30
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920
material.

31
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.160
This is the one we're going to reference.

32
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.200
Now you'll see in our content drawer we have a series of ones that you can also look at

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.719
too underneath our intro to materials.

34
00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.000
You'll see there's a step one, step two, step three and they just give you the basic structure

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.199
or you can simply just open up the one that I'm working with in particular this one and

36
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:11.159
you can just double click on this material and pull it up and you can follow along as

37
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.919
I work in the scene.

38
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.319
We're going to go ahead and build them out.

39
00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.280
I'm going to explain how these systems work as well as show you how to create these things,

40
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.840
comment boxes and to be able to help you organize things a bit better.

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.280
First up we want to go in here and build our own material.

42
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.639
So I'm going to go to the content drawer.

43
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.280
You'll see in our class folder we have a folder called in class mat.

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
In here we can simply just go ahead and make a new material.

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.599
So I'm going to go and right click in here as I go and right click I'm going to go up

46
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.759
to material.

47
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.560
There's also another section which allows you to get to the more advanced options for

48
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.840
materials which we get into in other classes.

49
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.199
But for now we're just going to go straight up here right where the material rests and

50
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.199
I'm going to click on that.

51
00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:01.680
I'm going to say M underscore which is a good habit to get into for your prefects and I'm

52
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.079
going to just call this sample parent and you can call it whatever it is.

53
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.680
Just don't call them late for dinner.

54
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.719
I know really bad joke.

55
00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.680
So I'm going to go ahead and double click on this guy and we're going to move this over

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.480
into my scene and I should say into the view so you can see it.

57
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.560
So let's go ahead and open this up.

58
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.800
Now you can have any texture you want when you're creating your parent material because

59
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.719
you want to expose those textures and swap them out later on.

60
00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.400
But for the sample purposes and so that you can follow along we're going to use the same

61
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.400
textures that I am working with so we're going to be using the ones from the wet stone underneath

62
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
the mega scans.

63
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.560
So if we go to our content drawer you're going to see mega scans and you're going to see

64
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.879
underneath their surfaces and towards the bottom and I'll pulse my cursor you're going

65
00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.639
to see wet stone ground and this is the one we're primarily going to work with.

66
00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.719
So I'm going to go ahead and grab the albedo.

67
00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.639
You don't need the AO for this example.

68
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:15.639
We'll grab the over here the normal and the rough and I think that's pretty much all we

69
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.639
need right now.

70
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.360
And if you wanted to we could even do use the AO as metallic and for this example we'll

71
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360
do that.

72
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.519
We'll we'll grab the AO and we'll use it as a cheap metallic.

73
00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:30.959
This obviously is a metallic surface but we're going to I'm going to show you how to get

74
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.680
that set up properly and how that works in Unreal.

75
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
So we'll keep that for now.

76
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.680
Let me go and drag them into our scene and you can simply do this whenever you have a

77
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680
texture.

78
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.199
So I can pull the textures in from my content drawer.

79
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.920
Whenever you import a texture you can right click and import a texture.

80
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.280
You can even grab any texture which I showed before and you can grab it from say your library.

81
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.960
I'll grab these pictures here and say I want to grab you know like we did before you can

82
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:02.120
grab this and grab an illustration.

83
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120
Pull it in here.

84
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120
You can also do that too.

85
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.719
So just a quick reminder on that.

86
00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.359
There's multiple ways to be able to get them into play.

87
00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:14.479
So now let's go ahead and go in here and build out what we need.

88
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.519
But before we get too far into that let me talk to you about organization.

89
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:22.399
Now whenever you're building out your scenes you want to be able to organize things and

90
00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:25.199
put comments and descriptions where needed.

91
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.959
One way to be able to do that is I can go in here and I'm going to move this normal over

92
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:29.959
here.

93
00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.199
I'm going to highlight him and hit the C key.

94
00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.759
And if I want to I can call this normal and typically you would but I can change the color

95
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.519
of this comment box to whatever color I need.

96
00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:45.680
And this particular case will choose blue seems appropriate for normal and we'll hit

97
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.000
OK.

98
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.480
And then now whatever I have in this box is going to come along for the ride.

99
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.280
If I move this box over here next to this texture here is also going to come along for

100
00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.720
the ride but is non destructive so I can remove anything at any time and I can also delete

101
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.640
it if I wanted to or change its name.

102
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.280
Pretty cool pretty convenient to be able to work with that.

103
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.840
You can also continually add some more description information here with there's a little dot

104
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.879
dot that shows up at the top and you can say hey Tom.

105
00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:32.560
Save my normal alone and my sandwich can't spell sandwich sandwich a sandwich a sandwich

106
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.600
my burger alone.

107
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.839
So you can put all sorts of notes in there and you'll see it show up in the details here

108
00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.360
underneath description.

109
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.000
You can also pin that note so that it actually does not lose or scale down to become a very

110
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.080
hard to read.

111
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.879
You can see it from a distance.

112
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.360
It's actually pretty cool to be able to do this and it's just another added way to keep

113
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.680
things organized.

114
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.360
So let me actually attach a few things in here in unreal and build some stuff out so I can

115
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.160
talk a little bit about the string organization options that you have.

116
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.920
First up we have in our texture here let's actually expose this.

117
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.319
We want to expose this so that when we make a child it is actually it can be seen and

118
00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.040
edited after the fact and you want to do that going to convert to parameter.

119
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.200
I'm going to call this one the albedo and again these textures can be anything because

120
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.600
in the parent if you obviously if your UVs are matching or you know its destination

121
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.520
in the parent if we have them exposed later on in the instance we can swap them out to

122
00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:43.039
whatever texture we need for that particular scenario of workflow.

123
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:44.539
I'm going to keep my finger on the M key.

124
00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.039
I'm going to hit multiply.

125
00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:50.719
Now multiply and add I'm going to hit A key and do add each one of these kind of acts

126
00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:53.079
like a Photoshop filter.

127
00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:57.599
They work under the same type of principle where you're adding or you're multiplying

128
00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.240
you can do this through an inconstant if you want to number wise or you can also do it

129
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240
via image.

130
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.479
It allows you to multiply the textures between each other and you also have the add so kind

131
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.680
of layers them on each other also.

132
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.040
And we'll talk a little bit about more about that later in the next class where the difference

133
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.080
between them specifically when it comes to UV layout.

134
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.280
So I'm going to go ahead and hit the four key here.

135
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.920
Those could be the three key to this is basically showing you again this is a for constant vector.

136
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.159
You'll see constant for vector there.

137
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.079
This gives us color information so we can start this out as white that works best with

138
00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:44.079
multiply in this particular case.

139
00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:49.839
And it gives us a nice neutral place to be at we want to convert this to parameters so

140
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:52.559
it actually can be edited after the fact.

141
00:08:52.559 --> 00:09:02.519
So let's convert that to a parameter and we'll call this albedo tint.

142
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.919
And we're going to pull that execution string to the beach.

143
00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:10.240
And I'm going to pull this albedo to the channel here.

144
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.399
And I'm going to grab this multiply and pull that into the base color.

145
00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:19.399
Now you have some even further ways to keep things organized.

146
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:24.840
If I select these group of nodes, I can right click in here and you'll see there's an alignment

147
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.559
area underneath the alignment area can align to the top if I wanted to now them kind of

148
00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:31.679
stack on top of each other.

149
00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:34.799
Or you can have it so you can keep things a little more straight.

150
00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:40.199
So if I went in here, I can do alignment and we'll say, Hey, you know what, I want to let's

151
00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:42.119
align to the left.

152
00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:43.359
Let's center this.

153
00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:44.799
Let's straighten connections.

154
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.039
You have all options to be able to do that.

155
00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:54.279
Now we don't really have these guys set up in an extreme of a setup here.

156
00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.039
So you'll notice the connections aren't really straightening too much here.

157
00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:00.240
And you can also, like we said before, do reroute nodes.

158
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.599
If you need them, move things around.

159
00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:07.079
This allows you to go in here and you can do whatever you want when it comes to building

160
00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:09.599
your stuff out.

161
00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:11.159
Now I don't use them too often.

162
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:14.439
Typically I'll use a reroute and I just put things in the right area.

163
00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:25.599
I'll use a name to reroute node, which we talked about, which you can go in here and do so.

164
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.759
And that keeps also things a little bit cleaner as well as collapsing, which we talked about.

165
00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:33.159
But I just wanted to point that out that those options are there to be able to do so.

166
00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:35.519
Well, it looks like I double clicked.

167
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.759
So feel free to actually play with those if you need them.

168
00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:44.600
They can be pretty helpful.

169
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.759
Let's go and build out the rest of our nodes here.

170
00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:48.759
Next up we have metal.

171
00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.680
Now again, we're not working with metal, but we're going to add it in here so you can just

172
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.680
see me build the system out.

173
00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:56.439
Remember, metal works out as zero to one.

174
00:10:56.439 --> 00:11:00.199
So if I wanted to, I could simply just plug in Metallic in here.

175
00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:04.159
I could also go in here, right click and say, hey, promote the variable and just have my

176
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.679
metal information driven by numbers.

177
00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:10.399
But specifically when you're working with textures and you want a little more visual

178
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:16.239
fidelity, high quality, you want to try to plug in metal if you have it in your texture

179
00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:21.159
wise, and then we can create a system to be able to control how much that's coming in.

180
00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:24.439
But again, you can promote variable to any of these.

181
00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:27.159
So I'm going to go here under texture sample.

182
00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:33.679
I'm going to go ahead and create, hit my finger, the M key or multiply that's M key left click.

183
00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.919
And I'm going to keep my finger the S key left click.

184
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:41.120
And this is a constant, a constant with an exposed parameter that makes it so that I

185
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120
can control values.

186
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.439
So I'm going to call this metal ness intensity.

187
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.440
There we go.

188
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.440
Sweet.

189
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.440
And I'm going to set this to one so it's on.

190
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.520
Now you'll notice off to the right or the left here, we have a default value control,

191
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.680
we have a slide minimum and slide max.

192
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.560
So our slide max can still be set to one.

193
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.800
And typically with metal, it's going to be that because it's a zero one scenario.

194
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.080
We can choose the grouping here.

195
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.840
So let's group this so you can at least get an example of it.

196
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.400
I'm not going to necessarily group all of them going forward.

197
00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:19.039
But for the most part, you're going to see it here in this particular example.

198
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:25.559
So we're going to say metal group as I say group by type group metal.

199
00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:28.799
And we're going to punch this into the B channel.

200
00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:32.240
And then we're going to punch this RGB execution string to a channel.

201
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.480
And we're going to drag this over to metallic.

202
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480
Awesome.

203
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.000
Great work so far.

204
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.399
You've built your first connection note, or at least I should say the second.

205
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:44.799
Now let's go ahead and slap the others together and I'm going to explain some of the workflows

206
00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.199
for them.

207
00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.679
So the next thing we want is roughness.

208
00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:49.479
Let me pull up this guy here.

209
00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:52.279
And again, we want to convert to parameter.

210
00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.240
We're going to call this rough.

211
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.799
We're going to convert this to parameter.

212
00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.799
We're called this metal.

213
00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:00.240
I'm going to right clicking convert to parameter metal.

214
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.159
And again, we're doing this so that they're exposed.

215
00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:07.319
And in the children, we can change things as we need.

216
00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:10.799
Now the nice thing about working with roughness and it doesn't quite work the same way with

217
00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.799
metal.

218
00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:13.359
I'm not sure why does it.

219
00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:16.639
It's kind of interesting and a little happy accident found a while back.

220
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:23.240
I can use a multiply for it and I can use a scalar parameter for rough intensity.

221
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:34.519
And that's the S key if you're not remembering.

222
00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:38.639
And I can drag this rough intensity inside of the B channel.

223
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:44.279
I'll set this to five with a maximum of five.

224
00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:47.519
And you'll say, well, Sean, how come it's one here, but why is it five here?

225
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:53.039
Well, the cool thing about the rough here is you can use this multiply to your advantage.

226
00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:57.039
It will actually go in here and make it so that you can have a higher value versus the

227
00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:00.840
metal one, which is strictly kind of stuck between one zero.

228
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.679
Now typically this is also one zero, but in this particular case, when it comes to the

229
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:08.159
rough, having this multiply gives us a little bit of a luxury.

230
00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:10.519
It's kind of a sneaky trick.

231
00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:11.959
So we go to roughness here.

232
00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:15.000
And notice we got a roughness values in here.

233
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.079
Oh, looks kind of nice, slightly shiny in some areas.

234
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.079
Pretty cool.

235
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:25.120
Now, finally, we're going to go in here and build out our normal map.

236
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.199
Now the normal map in Unreal, there's a couple ways you can handle this.

237
00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.579
And you'll see some of our sample content have the same look and feel.

238
00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:36.279
Sometimes when you're working with a normal map, you may decide that you want to invert

239
00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.279
it.

240
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.439
So to be able to have that option, you want to actually work with a thing called a flatten

241
00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:42.919
normal.

242
00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:47.919
This will make it so the normal is at an even plane field and at a zero and a proper zero

243
00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:48.919
area.

244
00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:53.559
Unfortunately, though, the default state of this, if we left it here will be slightly

245
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.559
off.

246
00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:58.720
So it needs a little bit of help the way that our flat numbers made at this time.

247
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.879
In other words, it shuffles from one side to the next and pushes a little bit too much

248
00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:05.240
into the negative in the very beginning.

249
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.879
And what we have to do for a flatness is go in here and type in a minus one.

250
00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.440
And I can pull this minus one into my flatness here.

251
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.000
And then I can make a scalar parameter just by pulling the string and we'll just type

252
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.039
in scalar.

253
00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:31.399
And the scalar parameter is going to be our normal control.

254
00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:37.959
And I'm going to set this to a value of five, we'll do a max of five, and then we'll also

255
00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:43.919
make a normal group.

256
00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:48.759
And rough, we can also make a rough group on him with him to is exposed.

257
00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:53.439
I'll do rough.

258
00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:56.879
And then now we grab that flatness normal and put it in here.

259
00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.120
Now if you didn't want to do that, say you never wanted to invert your normal, we'll

260
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.159
have that option.

261
00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:03.719
You can simply just do I'm going to duplicate this normal.

262
00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:09.839
Let's actually expose them real quick, convert parameter normal.

263
00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:14.079
We can simply just go in here and do control D for a second with it selected.

264
00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:15.919
It'll appear where my cursor is at.

265
00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:20.719
I can simply just hit the M key and have a normal control do control.

266
00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:22.839
You just can be super lazy here.

267
00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:26.919
And you can have something like this if you want it and simply just plug that into the

268
00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.000
normal if you want it to.

269
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.440
I'll actually like having the option to be able to invert my normal if I wanted to.

270
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.960
But this is the more simplistic way to do it.

271
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.679
This is the way you'll see on many of our example content, giving you the option to

272
00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:44.159
be able to invert things if you needed.

273
00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:49.399
So once we've made this, we're now going to go ahead and we're going to go to where it

274
00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.679
lives.

275
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.320
Let's hit apply.

276
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.480
Make sure everything updates.

277
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.840
And we're going to right click on it and go to create an instance material.

278
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.360
This instance material here.

279
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.599
Now again, you can leave INST at the suffix or put an MI for material instance.

280
00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.599
It's up to you.

281
00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.200
But Unreal at the bottom will let you know what it is too.

282
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.360
It's better to keep things organized the way that works for your workflow.

283
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.920
I can now double click on this material instance.

284
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.680
And you now see the exposed parameters.

285
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.160
Now you'll notice I don't have some of these grouped.

286
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.880
And if they not catching the first time, I did hit apply.

287
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.000
So if you do go to the rough, you only will see a rough, but for some reason it didn't

288
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.519
update, just hit save.

289
00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.799
And it should update accordingly.

290
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:43.799
And if it doesn't, just close it out.

291
00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.680
Mind it, mind it, no, I don't want to.

292
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.200
But we also want to make sure that these guys also have a parameter.

293
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.560
So let's go ahead and do rough.

294
00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:55.240
That's mainly what's sticking out here awkwardly.

295
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.839
And metal has a group.

296
00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:01.639
Let's put this in the metal group.

297
00:18:01.639 --> 00:18:02.639
There we go.

298
00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:04.319
Elbido doesn't have a group.

299
00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.440
Let's give it a group.

300
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.480
And it's always good to group things.

301
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.519
Get in that have as much as possible.

302
00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:14.519
There we go.

303
00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:15.519
And normal.

304
00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:17.359
He doesn't have a group.

305
00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:19.359
Let's put him in a group.

306
00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:22.359
There we go.

307
00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.359
And we're good.

308
00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:25.359
Now these guys don't have to be grouped.

309
00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:28.319
You can leave them alone because they don't have that option.

310
00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:31.719
So Unreal understands that these are part of the workflow and knows that these primaries

311
00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:33.079
are the main concern.

312
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:38.919
So now when I hit save, now when I go to the instance material, you're going to see these

313
00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:42.000
populate accordingly.

314
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
There we go.

315
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
There's the Elbido.

316
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
There's the metal.

317
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
There's the normal.

318
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.200
And again, all these can be updated on the fly.

319
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.000
And what I mean by that is like we can lower the normal.

320
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
We can increase the normal.

321
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.720
And it doesn't have to recompile a shader.

322
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.559
We can control the tint if you wanted to.

323
00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.000
We can do this all on the fly.

324
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.880
Kind of like what I demonstrated to you earlier.

325
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.400
Well that's it with this video.

326
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.680
In the next video, we're going to dive a little bit deeper and play with some animated materials

327
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.119
and processes when working with the material editor.

328
00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:13.440
Thanks again.
