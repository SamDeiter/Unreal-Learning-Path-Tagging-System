00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go and take a look at the material editor

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.259
and parent materials by starting out taking a look at the interface and how to organize

3
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.199
your workflows as well as looking at the interface later on and we're going to look at material

4
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.339
editors and how to work with instance materials and how that whole system lines up.

5
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.820
So let's get started.

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.800
So you'll see in the material editor overview window we have many things to look at here

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.539
and this can get a little bit daunting so we're going to jump into Unreal and I'm going

8
00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.079
to walk you through some of these things.

9
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.480
Once we do that we're going to talk a bit about organizing and then we'll make a have

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.179
another video for you in which we'll look at making a parent material and then working

11
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.060
with those nodes and then creating an instance material.

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.859
Let's go and dive right into Unreal and take a peek.

13
00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.179
So let's go ahead and I'm going to pick on this particular material here.

14
00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.780
So in this material you'll see that we have an instance material.

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.659
Now typically by default what happens is let's go ahead and go to the parent material first

16
00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.620
and let's double click on this instance material and you'll see with this instance material

17
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.019
open, let me pull it over to off screen, you'll see that we have a parent material.

18
00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:24.420
Now you're probably wondering what is an instance material?

19
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.619
It is a child of a parent material.

20
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.579
It's inheriting all the aspects of the parent material but encapsulated in such a way we

21
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.859
can quickly make changes without having to recompile the texture.

22
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.179
And what I mean by that is I can go in here and change my albedo intensity, I can change

23
00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.459
my albedo color if I wish, like hitting that tick box on and I can change all different

24
00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.659
types of aspects if they're open as in the parameters are open to be able to be changed

25
00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.459
in the parent material and I can then do so in the instance material.

26
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:07.139
And it gives you a quick and efficient way to change things the way that you need without

27
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.139
having to recompile.

28
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.939
So I'm quickly just changing the normal intensity here and you can see it change on the fly in

29
00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.620
3D and it's pretty cool, pretty nice to be able to work like this.

30
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.819
So let me go and set these back to default.

31
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.300
And let's go to the parent material.

32
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.819
In the parent material, let's talk about what we're looking at here because there's a lot

33
00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.060
to unpack and I want you guys to understand all the tools at your disposal.

34
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.620
Number one we can see that we have over here on the left is our viewer.

35
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.020
Now this viewer gives us a quick preview of what our material is going to look like in

36
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.580
our final output.

37
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.620
If you ever want to change the lighting and you want to check the normal roughness or

38
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.500
spec, you can keep your finger on the L key and you can left mouse click and get that

39
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.300
to update just by moving your mouse around.

40
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.220
You'll see here you can choose if you wanted to epic headquarters, which we have, which

41
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.380
is fine, or just gray wireframe.

42
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.380
It's up to you.

43
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.939
We'll leave it at epic headquarters, but we can show things just like we would normally

44
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.620
with unreal here in the viewer, such as what is it?

45
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
Do we want lids?

46
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.859
And we can look at our path tracing.

47
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:18.859
You can look at these.

48
00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.579
Now some of these may take a little bit to refresh and you may not always say, you know,

49
00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.180
I can't quite see if this is a complicated material or not.

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.139
You're going to mainly do that within your editor and you're going to be able to look

51
00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.139
at your optimization.

52
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.340
Optimization view modes a bit more efficient because some things which may have shader complexity

53
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.900
may not necessarily update and display here, but they definitely will inside of your editor.

54
00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.539
But these are ways you can check.

55
00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.420
So if for some reason you see that something isn't quite lined up, just keep that in mind.

56
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.860
That's something we are making it so it lines up a bit better.

57
00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.420
But there may be moments where you will see that, hey, that's not as complex as I thought

58
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.860
it was, but the editor will tell you different.

59
00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.819
You'll notice we can also change your shape here, any shape that we want to preview that

60
00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.420
material in 3D space.

61
00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:13.859
You can also, if you select, say this, say the item that you want in your scene, let's

62
00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.060
choose this guy.

63
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.860
With that selected, I'm going to go to that piece of geometry, hitting that magnifying

64
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.060
glass with a folder, and it's now has that geometry selected in a content browser.

65
00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:31.659
I can now click on the Cinderbock block here and it will load that into my scene.

66
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.260
And that's really helpful because now you can kind of get a one to one of the shape

67
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.060
object that has that material.

68
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.620
Down below, you'll see that we have a parameters area here that shows us some of the things

69
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.500
we have loaded and some of the organization we have in place.

70
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.100
We have our details here, which shows us how and what we use to choose how this material

71
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100
is going to be digested with an Unreal.

72
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.700
Now you'll notice our blend mode is opaque, shading model is default, but you can change

73
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.060
these based on your needs.

74
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.700
Now we dive into this later in more advanced material classes, but you can do everything

75
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.700
from a deferred decal if you just want like a sticker effect on a piece of geometry.

76
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.140
There's a light function to project light, which we'll go over later in the class.

77
00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.220
Volumes we'll talk about later in post process volumes, which allow you to change your

78
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.220
overall visual look using a loading the material in a post process volume.

79
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.420
You'll notice there's also blend modes.

80
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.220
We can choose mast for alpha, which we'll talk about later on to translucency, additive,

81
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.660
modulate in law.

82
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.060
All of these you can change based on what you want.

83
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.420
Like, hey, I want my alpha to look a certain way.

84
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.460
I want to look masked.

85
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.340
So we have like maybe some torn cloth, which we'll do later on.

86
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.260
You can choose these things depending on the look and the visual representation you need.

87
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.980
And there's also shader model.

88
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.660
This allows us to also choose such things as cloth, hair, eyes, as well as two sided

89
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.980
foliage in here and subsurface objects, which we'll also talk about later on.

90
00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.540
So this gives us a lot of things to choose from.

91
00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.180
Now, if you're noticing your shadows aren't correct when you move your light around,

92
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.060
you can also turn on, especially if it's a thin piece of geometry, two sided

93
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.300
geometry so that it is calculated correctly within the shader itself.

94
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.660
You can also use a thing called use material attributes, which we'll talk about later.

95
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.660
That allows you to encapsulate the final output here and redirect it so that you can

96
00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:35.379
now make a thing called make attributes, which we'll talk about again later on.

97
00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.860
And make attributes, it pretty much just substitutes this guy and turning it on

98
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.660
that tick box causes it to encapsulate.

99
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.180
You'll see that collapsing on itself and then it can redirect things as needed.

100
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.460
We'll turn that back on and get rid of this.

101
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.220
So there's a lot to choose from here.

102
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.460
I'm not going to get too much into buttonology because some of these are content

103
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.460
heavy as in context, I should say, as in having to do with particular classes,

104
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.420
which we'll cover it.

105
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.700
But I wanted to point that out.

106
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.220
You have a lot to choose from here.

107
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.060
So let's go ahead and talk a bit about the interface.

108
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.340
So here we have our save button as well as finding that material in the content

109
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.700
browser.

110
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.900
You say quickly clicked on that, took us there.

111
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.380
We can apply any changes if you want to test them out first.

112
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.139
I typically hit apply before I hit save because I may not like them or I may

113
00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.060
suspect that there might be some errors if I'm doing something a little bit

114
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.819
complex and experimenting.

115
00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.060
You can also search here.

116
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.659
You can search a particular node.

117
00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.100
You say, Hey, I want to look for the albedo.

118
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.060
I can choose that.

119
00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:36.500
Make sure I spell it correctly.

120
00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:37.659
It'll show me where it's at.

121
00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:39.300
And if I double click, it'll take me there.

122
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.579
Pretty nice to be able to do that, especially if you have a complicated

123
00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.339
material you're having to deal with.

124
00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.379
Now I can turn off the results here.

125
00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.899
Stats will let me know how my shader is being processed.

126
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.259
If there's any, you know, if there's any heavy tasks I'm noticing, maybe I put

127
00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:55.619
a lot of custom nodes in here.

128
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.819
This will show us some areas of instruction and also give you the errors

129
00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:00.579
if they occur.

130
00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:02.059
I'm going to close that too.

131
00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.979
You'll notice there's a thing on the right hand here called palette and the

132
00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.259
older versions of Unreal, this would be on by default.

133
00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:10.939
You can turn that on, but now we kind of have it.

134
00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:13.179
So it's like a shelf, which is kind of nice.

135
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.860
And you can go in here and look up anything that you need node wise.

136
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.019
And we have a lot of defaults you can choose from, especially if you're

137
00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:24.340
jumping into the unknown and experimenting, you can play with these and research

138
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.060
them some more.

139
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.019
They're pretty great.

140
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.620
I do warn you, it's kind of addictive working with materials.

141
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.819
It's one of my favorite things to work with.

142
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.060
And if you watch some of my other videos, I get pretty deep into them.

143
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.340
It's a blast.

144
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:42.700
Now you can go home if you're too far away from the final execution string here

145
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.220
of our nodes, you'll take you right there.

146
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.220
Right clicking on the home button.

147
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.020
There's also a hierarchy here.

148
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.379
So you can actually take a look at some of these.

149
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.180
It'll take you to that concrete floor or another particular thing that's

150
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.060
actually connected to this parent.

151
00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.940
It's just showing us everything connected to this parent material.

152
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.140
It just opened it up quickly for us.

153
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.060
We have a live update.

154
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.740
So we have preview material on.

155
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.780
We want to have that on.

156
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.100
But if you have real time nodes and other things that maybe some emotion

157
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.340
in movement, you want to test it out, you can have that on.

158
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.379
But by default, I typically just leave this on and should be fine.

159
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.180
You can clean up your graph.

160
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.420
And what that means is if I have any nodes floating around such as these guys,

161
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.860
I can say, Hey, man, clean up my graph, my graph here, and I'll clean it up

162
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.740
and it'll remove anything that doesn't have a connection.

163
00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:30.180
I'm going to hit control Z.

164
00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:31.139
I left those in there.

165
00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:32.820
So if you wanted to play around, you can.

166
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.139
You'll notice here we have preview state, hide unrelated stats, as well as platform.

167
00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:45.220
So you can actually choose what you're looking at your platform stats here.

168
00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.460
And you can choose where you're going to be sending things out the door.

169
00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.659
Is it Xbox is an iPad?

170
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.500
There's a lot of analyzing that can occur here.

171
00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:56.419
And that's just based on your needs.

172
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.500
Well, that's it with this one.

173
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.340
It gives you a little preview of the interface.

174
00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:06.179
We're going to talk a little bit more of it in the next video.

175
00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.860
And we're also going to talk about how to organize things when it comes to working

176
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.940
within the grid.

177
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.500
Thanks again.
