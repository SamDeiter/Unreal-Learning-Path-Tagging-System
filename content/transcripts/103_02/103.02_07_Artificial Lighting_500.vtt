1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280
We're now ready to take a look at some interior lighting or artificial lighting.

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.200
And just like I did with the natural daytime lighting, I wanted to go ahead and take a

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.880
look at some of the required versus optional tools they might have to use.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.880
So in the case of man-made lighting, we will need at least one or more man-made light sources,

5
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.280
so a point light, spotlight, or rectangular light, or a rect light.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.000
And then optionally, depending on your setup, a daylight type setup adjusted for moonlight,

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.520
so this would require at least directional light and a sky atmosphere.

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.160
A sky lighting to contribute to the rest of the global illumination.

9
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.880
A sky dome for backdrop visuals and volumetric clouds.

10
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.840
As well as if we want to use IES profiles for our man-made lights, should we need it.

11
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.120
So I think let's go ahead and open up our level here.

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.520
And just like I've been doing before, just so you know, I'm opening the bunker underscore night level.

13
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.240
And just like I did with the other levels, I'm going to go ahead and delete most of the lighting in here.

14
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.840
So let's go ahead and delete all these.

15
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.160
Delete all this lighting information.

16
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.800
And in this case, you can see we still have some lighting information coming from this sign.

17
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.560
And this is because we're using emissive materials that contribute to lighting.

18
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.240
One of them is on a decal, so let's go ahead and delete that.

19
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.080
And we'll assign the red material that we have here to the Bernese image here,

20
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.040
just so we get rid of most of the lighting.

21
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480
Now, one thing I'm not going to do is recreate the daylight setup,

22
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.280
because it's just essentially a daylight setup like we did before, but with moonlight.

23
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.160
Now, one thing that is slightly unique about this is that the sky atmosphere is accommodating right now for two directional lights,

24
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.400
one for the moon and one for the sun.

25
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.320
And by default, when we create an environment light mixer setup,

26
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.520
it just gives us something that's like nice daytime around 2 p.m.

27
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.280
In this case, if you were to create it, you might have noticed that while I was creating it,

28
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.960
I was skipping one of the atmospheric lights.

29
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.360
That's the one that you add to include a moon in there.

30
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760
So you can see we've got one directional light for the sun and one directional light for the moon.

31
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.840
Now, the only thing that's really important for you to know if you're going to go for a setup like this

32
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.080
is that the moonlight needs a different index to the sunlight.

33
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.640
So all you need to do is select the light search index

34
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.440
and make sure that the atmosphere sunlight index is set to one for your moon

35
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.760
and set to zero for your sun.

36
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.080
Okay, once you've done that, we're ready to go.

37
00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.400
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at some of the options or tools that we have to light interiors.

38
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.360
So first of all, we've got a point light, which is another light.

39
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.120
I know I've kind of gone over this a little bit before, but let's go ahead and go over it again.

40
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.080
So our point light emits light from a point in all directions.

41
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.480
And let's go ahead and bring the attenuation down on this one.

42
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.920
I'm going to bring it to like 300.

43
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.200
I'm going to bring it close to the wall so we can take a look at.

44
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.760
We're going to go ahead and change the temperature here to make it a lot more blue.

45
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.600
And ways in which we can control the look of this is of course the source radius.

46
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.560
So we can change the size of that specular highlight.

47
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.400
If you go bigger than the actual bounds of the attenuation,

48
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.800
you'll notice that it's suffering some ugly pixelation.

49
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.160
So try to avoid that.

50
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.120
But with this size, let's go ahead and set it to the size of two or something like that.

51
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.760
And then we can also change the source length.

52
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.720
So the length of the actual source of light.

53
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.320
So if I rotate this 90 degrees, we can bring it over to the wall

54
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.280
and get a sort of tube lighting setup.

55
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640
Now the intensity of this is way too strong, so let's change it to something like one.

56
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.560
So now you can sort of see I've got a tube light setup with a point light.

57
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.040
Now remember, this is a light that's shooting light, sorry, light in all directions.

58
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.680
So it's a little bit more expensive than if you were using something a little bit more directional.

59
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.080
Say for example, a spotlight.

60
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.080
So if I add a spotlight in here, and sorry, I'll re-add that since it went somewhere a little bit weird.

61
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.520
So I've got a spotlight in here.

62
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.720
And you can see the tool that I have in my disposal to edit this.

63
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.760
First of all, let's go ahead and make it moveable since we're using Lumen.

64
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.000
And second of all, we can change the outer cone angle to change the actual shape of the light.

65
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.920
You can change the inner cone angle to change the hardness of the light.

66
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.080
So this is a little bit like that inner radius or source radius, but defining the cone itself alone.

67
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
You can also change the source radius, so the actual source of the light.

68
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.040
Let me bring this a little bit closer to the wall so we can see the difference there properly.

69
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.720
You can see how it changes the source radius, changes that specular highlight once again.

70
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.360
And you can also change the source length.

71
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.200
Let's go ahead and we're actually going to use this to start lighting this since this is a little bit of a spotlight.

72
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.800
So I'm going to change the temperature here to maybe 4000 Kelvin.

73
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.920
I'm going to move it around there.

74
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.240
And I could start editing the outer cone and inner cone to get some nice results.

75
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.080
Oh, what I think I'm going to do, I'll make the outer cone a little bit wider.

76
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.440
But what I think I'm going to do is actually use an IES profile.

77
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.640
So let's go ahead and scroll down to the IES section and under IES, I'm going to grab this number 10.

78
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360
It's a pretty nice shape. Let's try with this one.

79
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.280
And I think these are all a little bit dark on one side.

80
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.920
So I think I'm going to go with this number 10 one here.

81
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.600
And let's go ahead and change the attenuation of the light to make sure that we're reaching the right amount.

82
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.920
So the attenuation is quite big here.

83
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.760
So let's go ahead and maybe try with 550.

84
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.760
And now what I'm going to do is duplicate the lights and place it around.

85
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.960
So I'm going to hold Alt and then move it around.

86
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.360
So I'm going to hold Alt and then move.

87
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.920
And then Alt again to duplicate and move the light.

88
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.240
There we go. It's time to get some some lighting in our scene.

89
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.600
I'm also going to add a spotlight for this light over here, this big one in the middle.

90
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.280
So let's go ahead and add a spotlight there.

91
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.800
And then I'm roughly placing these.

92
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.000
In this case, I think I'm going to get rid of the IES profile.

93
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
So I'm going to clear it here.

94
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.400
I'm just going to make the outer cone much wider.

95
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.360
Like so. Same for the inner cone.

96
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.840
Just to give it a bit more strength.

97
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.040
And I'll bring the attenuation radius up so it's a little bit stronger.

98
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.520
Just might bring the intensity down to something like five.

99
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520
So we don't flatten the scene out too much.

100
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.200
Maybe three. There we go.

101
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.320
Now we have a little bit of lighting information for everything.

102
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.680
So that's how we can control spotlights.

103
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.400
The next light that I want to take a look at is a rectangular light.

104
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.160
And we're going to take a look at it with this TV thing that we've got going on here.

105
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.600
But for that, I'm going to delete these two lights.

106
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.160
Just so that we have a little bit of a darker scene to play with.

107
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.880
And for something like this, we want to be using a rectangular light or a rec light.

108
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.240
So let's go ahead and drag this in.

109
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:07.280
And I just rotate it and essentially make it match the actual shape of the TV.

110
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.360
So let's go ahead and bring it closer to the TV.

111
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.000
Place it as central as I can.

112
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.920
I'm just eyeballing this.

113
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.560
And in this case, I can change the source radius.

114
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.600
Sorry, the source width and height to edit the way this looks.

115
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.040
So let's go ahead and just roughly make it the size of the TV here.

116
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.720
And now depending on the light that you have,

117
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.360
you can actually change some attributes of this rectangular light to be more interesting.

118
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.480
So for example, the barn door angle, if the light needed to be kind of contained a little bit to

119
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.640
change its shape and the barn door length.

120
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.600
So you can sort of see how you can affect the light there.

121
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.120
In our case, I think we actually want these to be flattened

122
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.880
since it's just a flat screen TV.

123
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400
It's got a little bit of an angle, so let's try and match that.

124
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.920
We'll turn off the angle snap.

125
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.720
Match the angle.

126
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.200
There we go.

127
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.640
Turn these back on.

128
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.800
So now, okay, we have something that's pretty good,

129
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.560
but the light color is not matching the actual light of the color of the image.

130
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.640
And the intensity as well.

131
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.360
So let's go ahead and change the intensity to something like four.

132
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.360
And then I could manually change the color to something close.

133
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.680
I could even color pick a color from there and match as good as I can.

134
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.520
I could also just manually match the color myself

135
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.760
to something that makes a little bit more sense.

136
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.040
But actually, one of the nicest features about this rectangular light

137
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.720
is that you can actually use a source texture to texture the light itself.

138
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.440
So I'm going to go ahead and use the texture that is being used on that screen.

139
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.960
Let me go ahead and show what happens.

140
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.720
So this is the texture that's on the screen.

141
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.560
I'm going to go ahead and drag it into source texture.

142
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.960
And you'll see it's lighting, but it's actually almost too perfect, right?

143
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.240
It gives us too much of an accurate representation of the image.

144
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.000
So usually what we do is use a blurred light texture.

145
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.040
So it's the same texture as the original, but it's blurred.

146
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.440
And using that, you can see we get a really nice realistic effect

147
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.000
of what the TV is actually lighting up.

148
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.520
And again, this still works with all your intensity controls,

149
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.960
so you have nothing to change there.

150
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.200
There we have it.

151
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.800
We've looked at all the sort of man-made light systems that we have.

152
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.000
Now, the last thing that I wanted to cover is emissive lighting.

153
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So I'm going to go ahead and once again, just delete all of our work

154
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.000
and get rid of these lights.

155
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.640
We'll leave these.

156
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.640
And take a look at how we can use emissive materials to change lighting.

157
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.240
So for example, if we go to the material section here,

158
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.320
you'll notice that we have an emissive material here that's emissive.

159
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.040
If I drag this onto the object, you can see that it starts emitting light.

160
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.440
Now, there's a couple of things that you need to worry about with emissive lighting

161
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.280
is that the quality isn't as good as using the emissive material.

162
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.640
It's as good as using actual lights.

163
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.640
So it's best to actually rely on proper lights to do the work for you.

164
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.440
But it might be handy in a couple of different situations.

165
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.280
And by the way, of course, this is all dynamic

166
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.080
and works exactly the same as you'd expect.

167
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.200
So in this case, I'm going to go ahead and keep that with the red color

168
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.920
and I'm going to assign this material to our burnie sign.

169
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.840
Now, you'll notice that this does affect things and it is lighting things up,

170
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.200
but you might not be getting the full effect that you need.

171
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.600
So in some cases, you need additional information

172
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.920
to actually get the final result that you want.

173
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.000
In our case, we're going to need a rectangular light

174
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.480
to project a little bit more light coming out of this.

175
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.560
So let's go ahead and add a rectangular light.

176
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.880
I'm going to turn it around just like before.

177
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.160
Place it in the correct place.

178
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.000
I think this might actually be rotated a bit.

179
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.080
Place it here.

180
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.280
And again, I'm just going to roughly match that shape.

181
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.520
And I will be changing the attenuation.

182
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.560
So it's not strong.

183
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.040
Say something like this.

184
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.200
And we'll change the color to this sort of neon red

185
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.400
that we've got going on here.

186
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.160
So we have the light that it's producing.

187
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.600
But you can see we don't have any lighting information on this side here.

188
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.800
And for this, we might actually have to use a decal actor.

189
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.000
So I'm going to go ahead and bring a decal actor in.

190
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.080
And a decal just allows us to project a material or an image onto a surface.

191
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.920
Now, they're really good for things like dirt and things like that,

192
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.200
but they can also be used as lighting if they use a massive material on them.

193
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.000
So let's go ahead and put the emissive material on it for the decal that we have here.

194
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.280
And we're just going to project it, if I rotate it here,

195
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.880
onto our image.

196
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.320
And I'm just going to essentially rotate it and scale it to the right position.

197
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.760
Go a little bit smaller.

198
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.880
And you got to be careful when scaling because you might scale it too much and

199
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.000
you won't be able to actually see it on the wall.

200
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.840
So you just have to keep nudging.

201
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:52.880
There we go.

202
00:13:52.880 --> 00:14:00.000
We have something that matches our image here and starts to produce light as well.

203
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.480
So that really is all the techniques that we need to color for interior lighting.

204
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.920
And really all the techniques that we need to cover for this whole introductory video.

205
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.840
So I hope that you've learned a lot and I hope that you had fun with me

206
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.760
and I'll catch you in the next one.
