00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
Okay, so before we move on and start looking at interior lighting, I wanted to go ahead

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.720
and show you some of the additional tools that Unreal Engine has that might help you

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.640
when lighting a scene.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.100
So the first of which is going to be changing your view mode.

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.720
So when debugging and trying to figure out what's actually going on, it can be handy

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.000
to change your view mode to different modes, for example, to an lit mode where you're actually

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.680
able to see just perfect color data information.

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.000
You also have modes like Light and Only, which allow you to just see the lighting with no

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.600
reflections or normal information, just what the light itself is doing.

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320
You also have Detail Lighting, which includes reflections and normal information.

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.960
These are some of the view modes that essentially can be helpful when trying to devote what

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.640
might be going wrong or just help you get that extra little nudge where you need it

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.400
to get the right realism for your scene.

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.240
I'm going to go back to lit mode.

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.640
And another one of the things that I want to touch on is the scalability tools.

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.680
These are usually designed to bring stuff down in quality if your machine's struggling

17
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.000
with rendering the scene.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.400
However, for architectural engineering and construction industries, we might want to

19
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.080
crank these all the way to the top since usually we have high-end PCs.

20
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.480
So I'm going to go to Settings here.

21
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.200
And under Engine Scalability Settings, I'm going to set everything to cinematic.

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.320
So you'll see you'll get a little quality bump right there, which is really handy.

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.160
One other thing I wanted to show is sometimes you'll notice that by any accidental change

24
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.180
that you might have done, you'll be missing certain things from the scene.

25
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.960
So the show flag here might be handy.

26
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.000
Say, for example, you accidentally turned off anti-aliasing.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.160
All this information is all the way over here in the Show tab.

28
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.920
And here you can also turn on stuff like motion blur and things like that if you so desire.

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.280
Now one last thing that I wanted to check in order to get that extra little bit of performance

30
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.400
out of the engine is if you go to Window and Project Settings, sorry, Edit Project Settings,

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960
we're going to go to the Render tab again.

32
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.320
We're going to change our G-Buffer format.

33
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.320
So we're going to Render in.

34
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320
This time I'm looking for the Optimization tab.

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.360
So I'm going to scroll all the way down.

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.360
And here under Optimizations, I'm going to take a look at the G-Buffer format.

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.100
I'm going to set this to high-precision normals.

38
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.360
So this will encode the normals in 16 bits per channel, and it will give us higher and

39
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.320
better detail.

40
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.280
Now the next tool I want to take a look at, the Calibration tools.

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.360
So sometimes we're going to want to start working from a calibrated scene that's matching

42
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.560
something in the real world.

43
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.480
So what I'm going to do is access the Calibrator.

44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.560
To do this, I actually need engine content available.

45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.600
If you missed that earlier on, you could just enable it by going to Settings, Show Engine

46
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.440
Content.

47
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.920
And in here, I'm going to search for Calibrator.

48
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.040
Now with this, I can actually drag in my color calibration tool.

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.440
And this essentially gives me a few bits of information and color that I can calibrate

50
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.240
against in the real world.

51
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.640
So an important step to do is to just set the Calibrator to face the sun.

52
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.320
And then what we're going to do is use a little tool called the Pixel Inspector, and we're

53
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.440
going to calibrate this square here, the third gray square from the right, to be perfect

54
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.680
gray essentially.

55
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.360
So in order to do that, all I'm going to do is go to Tools, Debug, Pixel Inspector.

56
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.000
And the way you use this tool is really simple.

57
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.600
You just click the little search button here, and now you hover over the pixel that you

58
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.480
want to sample.

59
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.360
Once you hover over that pixel, you can press Escape to freeze that pixel essentially.

60
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.320
And what we're looking for is this luminance value here, so enter a value of 0.18.

61
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.360
Now mine's already calibrated.

62
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.880
However, if, say for example, your lighting was at 10, you might want to now start adjusting

63
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.680
things to get the right value.

64
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.680
So if we go to Debug once again, Pixel Inspector, we'll find that pixel once again.

65
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.080
And you can see my luminance here is now set to 2.2.

66
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.920
Now usually what you want to do is bring this down to 0.8 with the dominant directional

67
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.480
light and then start adjusting your exposure later on to actually get the right level of

68
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.880
light that you want.

69
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.120
So in order to do this, I'm just going to go ahead and inspect the one that I want,

70
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.920
press Escape, and now bring the strength of my directional light down.

71
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.320
So let's try it with full.

72
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.720
Once again, we can inspect it.

73
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.320
We're at 0.19, so we're close.

74
00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.520
So once again, Escape, set this to 3.8, and that's how you sort of hone in on the value

75
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
that you need.

76
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.200
So essentially that gives us a, in the linear scale, it creates to 50% gray, but since we

77
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.600
have sRGB going on an HDR, it's something that adjusts the curve of the value.

78
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.600
So illuminance of 0.18 is the correct sort of 50% gray.

79
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.400
So from here, we now want to tweak our exposure.

80
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.600
So to tweak our exposure, we've got a few methods.

81
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.000
If you want to do it just on the viewport, you can go to the Lit tab here and just untick

82
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.200
game settings and start editing the exposure through here.

83
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.000
Now, it's important to know that this only really affects it for the viewport, so it's

84
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
not really handy when actually going into the game.

85
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.900
To do that, you actually want to do changes based on the post-process volume.

86
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.000
So I'm going to select that post-process volume.

87
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm going to scroll down until I find the exposure settings.

88
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.400
Now, if you're struggling to find it for whatever reason, you can always just use the search

89
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
tab.

90
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.200
Search exposure.

91
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200
In our case, I just found it right there.

92
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.600
So we've got it right here.

93
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.200
So we have three ways of measuring exposure, and you can control them using the post-process

94
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.600
volume, as I mentioned.

95
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.600
So the three modes are auto-exposure histogram, which provides a lot of control with advanced

96
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.000
settings, and it's constructed on a 64-bin histogram.

97
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.700
And it's the default exposure setting the Unreal Engine comes with.

98
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.100
Then there's a basic, if we change this to basic auto-exposure, it provides fewer settings

99
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.900
for us to actually change, and it computes single values by downsampling exposure itself.

100
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.000
And then a manual mode, which actually enables us to change this based on the camera itself.

101
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.500
So in our case, we're going to keep it to auto-exposure histogram.

102
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.000
And essentially, what you want to be changing more than anything is the minimum and maximum

103
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.300
brightness that you have in your scene.

104
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.100
So you can bring these values down or up to suit your needs.

105
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.500
And these will affect how the auto-exposure changes depending on what you're looking at

106
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500
in the scene.

107
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.300
Now, remember that this has to be set to game settings to see the changes that you're making here.

108
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.700
For me, we can leave them as default.

109
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.700
Or what I like to do is, as I'm working, I like to lock my exposure.

110
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.900
So I set this to one and then this to one.

111
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.500
And once I'm happy with the way everything feels, I can then maybe go to the default

112
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.100
or edit them slightly.

113
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.600
Because if you can see here now, we'll get eye adaptation to adjust for the darkness

114
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.500
on the inside here, which blooms out the outside.

115
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:53.600
So I generally like to work with this set to one and one to lock it in.

116
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.800
And then go from these values to edit things afterwards.

117
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.900
So I could go to minus five and ten instead so that it never goes that bright or that dark.

118
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.000
So it's something for you to play with and get the right look for your scene.

119
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
But I just want to go over these additional tools before we jump into going to artificial

120
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.800
lighting, which we're going to go ahead and do next.
