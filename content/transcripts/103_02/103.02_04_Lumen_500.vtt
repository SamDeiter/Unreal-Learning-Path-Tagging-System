00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120
Okay, so before we hop into actually setting up our natural light and scene, I wanted to

2
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.720
give an overview of Lumen and essentially take a look at and highlight some of the features

3
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.400
that it comes with.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.920
So Lumen is a default lighting system inside of Unreal Engine 5, which is a fully dynamic

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.160
global illumination system, like I mentioned before.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.960
It gives us performance reflections and they're actually supported in clear coat materials,

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600
which are important for car paint.

8
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.480
It's compatible with large open worlds, and as I said before, it's all real time, so there's

9
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.320
no light baking, everything happening and streaming on the GPU.

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.200
It works really well on both outdoor and indoor scenes.

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
And one thing that's actually really nice is that emissive materials can contribute

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.520
to lighting the scene itself.

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.920
One of the limitations of Lumen is that the global illumination and sky shadowing will

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.520
give you lower quality with translucent materials and volumetric fog.

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.800
If you use world position offset in a material to displace some verts on a mesh, it can cause

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
artifacts.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.240
There's no support for lighting channels.

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.760
It gives you poor mirror-like reflections, so that's something where you'd want to turn

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.400
on hardware ray tracing specifically for, which we'll take a look at.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.120
This deformation in general with hardware ray tracing will give you high cost with skeletal

21
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.000
mesh, so anything like skeletal mesh animations, it'll have a high cost rendering those out.

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.280
And it's really only supported on high end PCs and next-gen consoles and not supported

23
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.600
on mobile or VR.

24
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.320
So that's something to keep in mind if you wanted to move your project to Lumen-based

25
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.960
scene, stuff to keep in mind in terms of the limitations.

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.320
Lumen will be enabled by default, but if for whatever reason you're changing from an old

27
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.880
project that wasn't using Lumen or for whatever reason it wasn't set up as default by Unreal

28
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.360
Engine, we're going to take a look at how we actually set this up.

29
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.760
So once again, hop back into the project and see how we'd enable these settings.

30
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.840
So to enable Lumen, all you'd have to do is go to Edit Project Settings.

31
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.000
Inside of this window, I'm just going to maximize it.

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.400
We're going to go to the Render tab inside of Engine.

33
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.640
I'm going to scroll down to Global Illumination.

34
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.520
So the Global Illumination setting needs to be set to Lumen if you want to use it, but

35
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.400
here's where if you wanted to use any other system, like standalone ray tracing or anything

36
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.760
like that, you could use that.

37
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.080
It's important to note as well that the reflection method in this case is set to Lumen.

38
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.040
And one thing that you want to do to make sure that Lumen works correctly is make sure

39
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.240
that Generate Mesh Distance Fields is turned off.

40
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.600
Now some additional settings that might give you some better results.

41
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.760
Within Lumen, you'll want to use hardware ray tracing when available.

42
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.000
So this is important to note that if you have a high-end GPU like an RTX card, this is somewhere

43
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
where you can use it.

44
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.520
If not, it's not worth digging this.

45
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.720
And inside of the hardware ray tracing, make sure that Support Hardware Ray Tracing is

46
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.400
actually ticked so that you get all the benefits from that as well.

47
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.680
Now importantly, you can change the behavior of all these things using post-process volume

48
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.900
so you don't have to change them project-wide every time.

49
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.760
So in order to do that, all we have to do is create a post-process volume.

50
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.720
So I'm going to go to the Place Actor tab here.

51
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm going to search for Post, and I'll drag in a post-process volume.

52
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.800
Now in order, we already have one here, so I'm just going to go ahead and quickly delete

53
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
that.

54
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.840
And actually, that's actually changing some of our lighting settings here.

55
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.760
So let's go ahead and just use this one.

56
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.400
And there's a couple of things that you need to know to make sure that this post-process

57
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.700
volume actually affects your entire scene and not just the volume that it's represented.

58
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.020
So I'm going to go ahead and search here for Unbound.

59
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.260
And you can see here there's a tick box for infinite extent.

60
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.140
So make sure that that's ticked to ensure that that post-process becomes a global post-process

61
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.980
and affects the entire scene.

62
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.620
So in the case of the edits that we want to do for Lumen, or if you wanted to change any

63
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.300
of the settings, you want to go to the Global Illumination tab here.

64
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.860
And if you wanted to change it for other reasons, you could change it here.

65
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.580
And if you want to change the Insider Reflections, you can change the method as well to Lumen.

66
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.580
Okay.

67
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.980
And one last thing is that if you want to improve some of the quality of your scene,

68
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.220
and we're going to be talking quite minimized gains here as we go, but if you wanted to

69
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.820
update the final gather quality, if you want to bring this number up, it will reduce the

70
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.940
noise that you see in the scene, but it will greatly increase the cost.

71
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.660
So if you want to set this to 2, make sure that maybe the graininess that you might see

72
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.300
if you get really close gets fixed.

73
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:27.020
And really, I doubt it'll be easy to appreciate inside of the video that I'm making here.

74
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.940
But if you bring this value up, you'll see better quality and reduction of noise.

75
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.340
But again, just make sure you understand that this will significantly increase the cost

76
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.100
of rendering the scene and thus give you better, or sorry, poorer frame rates.

77
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.660
One last thing to note is that this is going to be mostly like the look of how Lumen actually

78
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.660
works.

79
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.100
It's going to be dictated by both the quality of the materials, the rest of the scene, and

80
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.780
also your exposure.

81
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.660
So if you, for example, have different exposure settings, you'll see Lumen adjust to that.

82
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.900
So just keep in mind that your exposure settings are going to affect the way the lighting scene

83
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.900
works as a whole.

84
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.580
So by default, I'm just going to tick game settings so it adjusts for me.

85
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.340
But just something to keep in mind once again.

86
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.140
Okay, I think we've covered everything we need to cover for Lumen.

87
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.540
I think we're ready to actually start setting up a natural lighting scene.

88
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.540
So let's go ahead and do that.
