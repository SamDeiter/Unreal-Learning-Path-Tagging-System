00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Okay, so that's going to be it for this Unreal Engine training session.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.200
We did an introduction to Lighting for architecture, engineering, and construction industries.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.600
The topics we covered were Lighting terminology and types.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.920
We had a common language for stuff like Direct Lighting and Indirect Lighting, and the types

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.080
of lights that we actually use.

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.460
We took a look at how to control exposure and the tools that we have available to that.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.520
We looked at Lumen as the default rendering engine in UE5.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.480
And then we went ahead and set up some Lighting scenarios for natural exterior lighting.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.200
We took a look at reflections and how to optimize them, as well as some setups for interior

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.560
lighting inside of the Unreal Engine.

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.760
I hope you had fun, and I'll see you in the next training session.
