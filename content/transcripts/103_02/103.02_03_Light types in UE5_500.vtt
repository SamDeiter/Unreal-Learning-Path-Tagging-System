00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, now that we've had a look at some basic concepts and the light types that exist in

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.520
Unreal Engine, I think it's time for us to open up the engine and look at them inside

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.000
of Unreal Engine 5 itself.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.060
To that avail, I've loaded up the project that was given to you with this course.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.220
In order to open the level up that I have here, all you have to do is go into the content

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.160
folder, levels, and open up bunker start.

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.720
Now you don't actually have to follow along with this particular level for this video,

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.320
but if you just wanted to get a look at exactly the same as I do here, that's what you need

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
to open.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.480
Another note that I want to take before we get into it is that you will notice that the

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
layout I have here might be different to the one you have in UE5 by default.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm using the UE4 classic layout because I think it's a little bit more clear because

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.960
everything is in view instead of the content drawer popping up in and out.

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.260
For these videos, instructionally, I think it's a little bit easier to be able to see

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
everything at a glance.

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.280
Although while you're working, once you get good with the engine, you might find that

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.320
actually the UE5 default setup is much nicer and faster and lets you focus a lot more on

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.320
the scene that you're working on yourself.

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.880
However, again, if you want to just load this layout, just to be able to follow along with

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.880
me one to one, all you have to do is go to Window, Load Layout, and UE4 classic layout.

21
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.480
If you just click that, it'll load up the layout that I have here.

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.400
So once again, just open the level, go to levels, bunker underscore start.

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.720
Okay, with that said, let's take a look at how we actually find the lights that we were

24
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.400
talking about just before.

25
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.840
I'm going to go to the lights section here inside of the Place Actors tab.

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.720
And you see here we have all the lights that are available to us, including the HDRI, Back

27
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.320
Delving Sun, and Sky, which are plugins that we'll have to load.

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.840
But again, I'll show you how to load those up later down the line.

29
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.960
The first thing I'm going to do is delete the lights that we see here, just so that

30
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.760
we can actually see what the impact of each one of them is individually.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.120
And let's go through them one by one.

32
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
So the first one is the Directional Light.

33
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.800
All I have to do to bring a light in is click, drag into the level, and you see the light

34
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
comes in.

35
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.940
And you'll notice that by default, we're already using Unreal Engine 5's default Lumen Dynamic

36
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.420
Global Illumination system.

37
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.360
So we're getting some beautiful bounce lighting already from the get-go.

38
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280
But the Directional Light, as we spoke about before, is just a light that is a bunch of

39
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.060
parallel rays from an infinite distance, essentially.

40
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.160
So it acts like a sun.

41
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.560
And I can go ahead and rotate this.

42
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.580
You can see Lumen doing its work already, bouncing that light and showing us some indirect

43
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.240
lighting here.

44
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.440
So that's the Directional Light.

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.720
The next one I'm going to look at is the Point Light, or you might know this as an Omni Light

46
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720
from other packages.

47
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.600
And I'm just going to scale down the attenuation a bit.

48
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.280
And you can see it's just light going in all directions from a point.

49
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
Then we have a Spot Light.

50
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500
I'll delete the previous one.

51
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.920
So Spot Light.

52
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.520
And then we have a Rectangular Light, which essentially emits the light from a rectangular

53
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.200
shape and not just one point.

54
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.080
Last but not least, we have a Sky Light, which will be able to look at the scene as a whole

55
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.840
and essentially generate a cube map that contributes to that indirect lighting as a whole.

56
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.160
So usually for daytime settings, this Directional Light and Sky Light are going to be really

57
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.600
essential to get a good look.

58
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.520
But we'll take a look at that in a proper example later down the line in this tutorial

59
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.320
session.

60
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.960
What I want to go over now is the type of lights that we can use and what we can actually

61
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.300
access and change in them as a rule or as a whole.

62
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.240
So let's go ahead and bring a Spot Light in here.

63
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.000
And you'll notice that the first thing that I'm going to talk about here is the mobility.

64
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.680
Now this is going to relate to the type of lighting that you're going to actually use.

65
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.680
So if you're using a Static Lighting setup, Static is the type of mobility you want.

66
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
And you'll notice as soon as I click it, the engines tell me already that lighting needs to be rebuilt.

67
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.480
Remember Static Lighting needs to be baked the same way you do in Corona or V-Ray.

68
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.400
But the good thing about it is that it's very cheap in terms of runtime performance since

69
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.360
it's all pre-calculated and nothing has to be calculated on runtime.

70
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.840
So that's very cheap light.

71
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.620
The next one is Stationary, which is a mix in between Static and Movable.

72
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.840
It gives you some really sharp direct shadows and direct illumination, but it's limited

73
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.820
in mobility and also limited in terms of how many stationary lights you can have overlap

74
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.300
in the same point.

75
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.420
So if I have one, two, three, and four, you'll notice that fourth one now comes up with the next.

76
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.160
And that's because we have all these four overlap in the same point.

77
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.000
Now this essentially gets turned into a Movable light, so you don't get the performance benefits

78
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.960
from using the stationary light.

79
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.160
So just something to keep in mind.

80
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.740
As I say, we will always in this case be using the Movable light since we want to take advantage

81
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.760
of Unreal Engine 5's real-time global illumination system.

82
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.380
So we're going to stick to Movable and you'll notice that your lights are Movable by the

83
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.200
fact that they have a little sort of four arrow icon here that let you know that it's

84
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200
Movable.

85
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.520
And that's the same for every type of light.

86
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.720
So if you drag this in and make it Movable, you'll notice that Movable icon will appear.

87
00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.400
So let's go ahead and make our directional and skylights Movable as well.

88
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.440
And let's take a look at some of the other settings.

89
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.600
Now before I touch on the other settings, I'm just going to quickly jump back into my

90
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.760
slides and talk about some of the settings that we're going to look at.

91
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.880
So we're going to take a look at Intensity.

92
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.320
Importantly, and with point and spotlights, you can either use unitless Unreal Engine

93
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.600
units, candelas, or lumens.

94
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.480
It's important to know that 100 watt light bulb is 1600 lumens.

95
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.520
And the directional light or the sunlight, as we just covered a second ago, is actually

96
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520
going to be measured in lux.

97
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.120
And it's going to have the default value of 75.

98
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.160
So because we are doing architectural engineering construction, it's probably best to stay away

99
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.800
from using the light color and stick to temperature, which is going to be measured in Kelvin.

100
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.240
So if you have a light bulb that you know runs at 3500K, then you can change that value

101
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.400
and expect exactly the same results inside of the engine itself.

102
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.920
We'll also take a look at affecting the indirect lighting intensity, so how much a light contributes

103
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.000
to that indirect lighting.

104
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The attenuation of lights, the difference between or the effect that change in the source

105
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.480
radius and length will have.

106
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.720
One thing to note is that all the lights will be using the inverse square falloff system.

107
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.200
So the lighting from the point that actually emanates light to the end of its attenuation

108
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.020
uses the inverse square falloff rule.

109
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:34.000
So it's exponentially brighter towards the point of emission of light.

110
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.280
And then we'll also take a look at IES profiles and how that helps us control the distribution

111
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.680
of light.

112
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.400
So if you say, for example, have a light bulb that you want to use and know the manufacturer,

113
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.760
usually they'll have their IES profiles available to download and download those and have the

114
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.200
same exact light distribution that that light bulb would have in real life.

115
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.000
So we're going to take a look at all of these and let's go ahead and take a look at them.

116
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.160
So intensity, I can just access the bottom here and you can see it right now is set to

117
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.560
8 candela.

118
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.800
So I can bring this up or down.

119
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.800
If I click and drag or you can manually enter a number, that's no problem whatsoever.

120
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.680
Set this one to 16.

121
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.040
We can also take a look at the temperature.

122
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.240
Now by default, the temperature isn't enabled.

123
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.880
You'll encourage to use light color.

124
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.280
So again, for AEC industries, I think it's best to just use temperature and try and match

125
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.400
some manufacturer light bulbs that you might actually know you're using in a particular

126
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400
space.

127
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.360
So let's say, for example, you know a light under 3500 K, then you can change it to that.

128
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.560
Next thing I want to take a look at is the indirect light and intensity.

129
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.640
So how much this light contributes to the indirect light and in the global illumination.

130
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.600
So let's, for example, set this up as such.

131
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.120
So I look up like that and if I change the indirect light and intensity to something,

132
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.600
let's go quite ridiculous, like 10, you can see it's contributed more in its bouncing.

133
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.880
So that indirect lighting gets contributed more by this light.

134
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.040
So you can sort of increase this to change how much that light is actually bouncing.

135
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.200
Again, the default is one, but you can change that manually yourself.

136
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.280
The attenuation of the light is essentially how far the light reaches.

137
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.840
So let's go ahead and change that with, in this case with spotlights, you can change

138
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.680
it with the outer and inner cone angles.

139
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:43.360
So the outer cone and then the inner cone, if you want to make a harder or softer light

140
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.480
distribution, you'll see actually called attenuation in here.

141
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.320
There we go, attenuation radius.

142
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.560
And I'm actually, I think I'm mistaken.

143
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:05.520
We do have attenuation here, which is how far from the point it actually goes.

144
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.320
Okay.

145
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.000
The next thing is the source radius and length.

146
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.960
So I'm going to go once again, just bring this light in here and I'm going to use temperature,

147
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.320
bring it down to 3500, just like in the other one.

148
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.400
We'll bring the attenuation down a little bit just so we can see things a bit more clearly.

149
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.040
I'm just going to bring this light a little bit up here so we can see more information.

150
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:38.560
And if I change the source radius and the source length, you'll see it changes the actual

151
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.280
source of the light, which means that when you take a look at the shape of the specular

152
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:49.560
highlight, you'll see a change in the actual reflection.

153
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.640
Okay.

154
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.680
If we change the length, this changes that distribution length and we can always rotate

155
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.760
the light if we wanted to change its direction.

156
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.600
Now if you were trying to make a fluorescent tube light, for example, I'd actually recommend

157
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.240
to use a rectangular light here.

158
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.960
Since you have a little bit more control and it's set up already more to work with particular

159
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.040
shapes, in this case rectangular, so that's a recommendation that I would give you.

160
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.960
But the last thing I'm going to take a look at is the IES profiles and you'll notice,

161
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.600
let me go ahead and bring the source length to zero here, and you'll notice that we have

162
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.400
a section in here inside the light profiles, which is the IES texture.

163
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:39.920
Now we have provided some IES profiles, so we'll actually use them with a spotlight.

164
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:50.000
So we'll bring this here, make it dynamic, we'll use temperature and once again bring

165
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.160
it to 3500, just for the sake of seeing the changes as we had them before.

166
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.520
And then essentially what I want to do is add a light profile.

167
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.520
So all I need to do is grab this and drag it into that shape.

168
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:20.560
And you can see it now follows the light distribution that that particular light bulb would have.

169
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.160
And that's really it for this section.

170
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
We haven't looked at HRI, Backdrop and Sun and Sky.

171
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.480
We're going to take a look at those in a little bit more of an isolated case, since they essentially

172
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.280
are blueprints that encompass a lot of information on how to set up or encompass a particular

173
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.000
setup for their particular use.

174
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.040
So I'm going to take a look at them individually, but we'll take a look at them down the line.

175
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.840
They're a little bit more advanced than these since they're a blueprint setup.

176
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.720
This is just a quick overview of the actual lighting tools that you have in Unreal and

177
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.520
how you can edit the particular properties.

178
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.680
So quick overview.

179
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.480
I think after this, it's worth getting into an actual example.

180
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.920
So we'll start taking a look at some natural light setups.

181
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.920
So we'll see you there.
