00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080
Okay, so before we get into the engine, I want to go over some basic terminologies and

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.560
concepts that you'll be hearing me use throughout the duration of the course.

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.440
And I just want to make sure that we have a common language and ground when I talk about

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.940
these things.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.240
So we'll be taking a look at what direct lighting versus indirect lighting and shadows are.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.000
So in this case, direct lighting is the light that goes directly from the light source onto

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.400
the surface without any interference, which means that it receives the full spectrum of

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.720
the light in terms of color.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.160
Now indirect lighting is slightly different to that.

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.800
It's when lighting's been bounced off a surface and lights another object.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.640
Now when lighting hits that surface, that surface absorbs some of the light and the

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.680
light that gets bounced out is actually tinted.

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.680
So indirect lighting contributes to the overall mood and light intensity of the scene and

14
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.720
color as well.

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.480
And then the shadows are important to understand that it's essentially a real engine takes

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.400
a snapshot of a mesh from the light's point of view and projects the shadow information

17
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.840
onto another surface from that point of view.

18
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.560
So as long as we're all agreed on this, I think as I start talking about these concepts

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.120
when we talk about lighting later down the line, I think we'll all understand what it

20
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
is I'm referring to.

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.360
And I also want to take a look at the types of lighting systems that exist in the engine.

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.600
For this course, we're going to be using real time dynamic global illumination since Unreal

23
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.400
Engine 5 comes with Lumen, which is an incredibly powerful and strong real time global illumination

24
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
system.

25
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.200
But I just wanted to go over the other options that you have as well to make sure that you

26
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.860
understand everything that's available.

27
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.480
So Unreal Engine has a baked or static lighting system, which is pre-computed.

28
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.420
This is created using Unreal Engine's Lightmass system.

29
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.940
And it's similar to rendering with lighting setups like V-Ray, Corona, et cetera.

30
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.980
And it's really high quality, but it's baked.

31
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.840
So it cannot be altered at runtime.

32
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.680
So once you bake it, it takes quite a long time to bake if you're using the CPU.

33
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.460
And then once that's done, you cannot edit it at runtime, which means you can't have

34
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.580
a light swing, for example, and update lighting in real time if you were using a purely static

35
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.580
system.

36
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.180
There's other systems like real time dynamic lighting, which is what we're going to be

37
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180
using.

38
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.100
Now, historically, this had no global illumination system.

39
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.840
So you only had direct light.

40
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.900
So there was no bounce light effect in the scene or anything like that for this type

41
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.080
of lighting.

42
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.460
But nowadays with Lumen and Unreal Engine 5, we do have that.

43
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.080
So we're going to be sticking to this sort of method, which means no baking times, nothing

44
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.820
to wait for, everything you see is happening in real time, and it's final straight away.

45
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.020
Now, as I say, Unreal Engine can use both static and dynamic lighting.

46
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.500
Traditionally, for architectural visualization and AEC industries in general, these projects

47
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.860
were typically stationary and baked.

48
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.180
But again, nowadays with Unreal Engine 5, we're going to be using Lumen, so we don't have

49
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.660
to worry so much about that.

50
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.500
The last type of system is hardware ray tracing.

51
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.180
So it's a lighting type that it's real time, just like the dynamic stuff.

52
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
However, it uses hardware ray tracing to calculate global illumination.

53
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.140
So all that bounce light and indirect lighting can also be calculated at runtime.

54
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.420
It requires very strong GPUs.

55
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.460
So you might have heard the Nvidia RTX card.

56
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.900
So that's something you're going to require if you're going to be using straight up ray

57
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.900
tracing.

58
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.500
Lumen uses software ray tracing, which means you don't need such a high end GPU.

59
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.340
So that's what we're going to stick to.

60
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.020
So those are the concepts that we need to go over.

61
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.540
In terms of terminology, I also want to take a quick look at the types of lights that we're

62
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.700
going to be seeing inside of the engine.

63
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.460
So the types of lights that we have available to us are directional lights, point lights,

64
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.380
spot lights, rectangular lights.

65
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.540
And now we start to get into the more interesting ones, which are the skylight, which will be

66
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.500
able to capture the scene as a whole and provide indirect lighting for the entire scene.

67
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.260
And then these last two, HDRI backdrops in sun and sky, they actually are plugins that

68
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.180
you have to enable, but they give you essentially a set of blueprints that combine a few lighting

69
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.020
concepts that we see here to give you a particular setup that might be useful for you.

70
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.220
So we will take a look at how to enable these and load them, but we'll be doing that inside

71
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.220
of the engine.
