Hello, and welcome to another Unreal Engine training session.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.880
This time we're going to take a look at lighting, specifically an introduction for architecture,

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.280
engineering, and construction industries.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.480
My name is James Burton, and I'm an Unreal Engine instructor.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.360
And in this course, we're going to be taking a look at the following topics.

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.220
First of all, we'll be covering lighting terminology and types, so the types of lights that you

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.160
have available in Unreal Engine, as well as going over some basic concepts to make sure

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.760
that we have some common ground and understand what we're talking about when referring to lighting.

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.200
We'll be taking a look at how we can control exposure and what tools we have to our disposal.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.800
Then we'll be taking a look at Lumen, which is Unreal Engine's default lighting system,

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.240
which is a dynamic global illumination system that's really, really cool.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.160
And then we'll be taking a look at creating some specific examples.

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.520
So since we're looking at architecture, engineering, construction, we're going to look at how to make

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.320
natural exterior lighting.

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.920
We'll also take a look at Lumen's reflection system and how we can get the most out of it,

16
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.600
as well as creating some examples of interior lighting to make sure that we cover the whole spectrum.

17
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.680
So I hope you have fun with me, but let's go ahead and get started.
