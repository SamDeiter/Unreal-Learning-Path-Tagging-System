1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
So I think we're now ready to tackle natural daytime light and scene.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.160
So let's take a look at the things that we're going to have to have required versus some

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.000
of the things that are optional to get a good setup for natural lighting.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.780
And the elements that you're going to need are a light source for the sun.

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.880
So generally, this is going to be a directional light.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.640
An atmosphere will be linked to the sun and adapt to its position.

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.960
A post-processing volume, which will allow us to tweak part of the lighting settings,

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.000
as well as other rendering aspects like exposure and bloom and things like that.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.040
And then optionally, we can add a skylight that will contribute to the global illumination,

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.120
which I actually think is a really nice touch on your scene.

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.640
So we'll be adding one of those to our scenes.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.040
A sky dome for background visuals if you need them.

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.120
Some volumetric clouds.

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.120
And if you need to, because you're using a static lighting solution, you will need

15
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960
a light mass importance volume.

16
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.800
So again, we're not going to use this since we're going to be using Lumen, which is all

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
real time.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.380
But if you are using a static solution, understand that you will need a light mass importance

19
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920
volume to get the most out of the scene.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
Now one other thing I want to touch on before we jump into the engine is that different

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.740
templates are made for different needs.

22
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.600
So if you're starting your project and you're in the AAC industry, make sure you do go to

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.160
the AAC tab and start your project from there because it will have some more advanced lighting

24
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600
setups than say some of the game systems or templates that we have.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.160
So yeah, not all templates are created equals and the levels within them use different setups

26
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.240
depending on the level that you start using.

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.680
So you have like the basic level, which uses a legacy daylight setup, the time of day,

28
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.160
which uses a newer approach, and then empty levels in case you want to start things from

29
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
scratch.

30
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.400
Now in our case, we're going to start things from scratch.

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.040
So let's go ahead and pop into the engine.

32
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.360
And essentially, we're going to recreate this.

33
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.520
So I've loaded up the Corbero Day map.

34
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.200
If you want to access that, all you have to do is go to levels and then open up Corbero

35
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Day.

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.120
And you see we have a nice little setup that we're going to delete and recreate.

37
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960
So I'm going to go ahead and delete every single one of these actors that contribute

38
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960
to the lighting.

39
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200
There we go.

40
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240
We are lightless.

41
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.800
Let's go ahead and start looking at how we can add all the things that we need.

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.040
So I'm going to go to the place actors tab here.

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.760
And first and foremost, we're going to need sun direction or sunlight.

44
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.120
Let's go ahead and drag a directional light.

45
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.880
I'm going to rotate it to make this a little bit more interesting, like so.

46
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.240
There we go.

47
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.240
We have a directional light.

48
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.280
That's a good start.

49
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.720
Now you'll notice that by default, Lumen is doing a lot of stuff already calculating

50
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.080
our global illumination, indirect bounce lighting, all of that good stuff out of the box from

51
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080
Unreal.

52
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440
Now, the next thing I'm going to need is an atmosphere.

53
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.360
So I'm going to go ahead and add an atmosphere since you can see the backdrop is very dark.

54
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360
So we add an atmosphere here.

55
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840
And you might notice it tells you, hey, you need to rebuild lighting.

56
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.360
And that's because I haven't changed this light here to moveable.

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.440
So I'm going to go ahead and do that.

58
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.280
But also I'm just going to refresh this by just going inside the scenario and moveable

59
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.320
just so that it actually understands that the directional light is actually moveable.

60
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.840
It's just a quick refresh.

61
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.960
The next thing I'm going to do, I'm just going to bring that up there.

62
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.560
The next thing I'm going to add is an exponential high fog.

63
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
So let's go ahead and search for high fog.

64
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600
There we go.

65
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600
Got it there.

66
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.680
The next thing I'm going to add is a skylight.

67
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.120
Once again, I'm going to set that to moveable.

68
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.280
That's what I'll leave at the bottom, actually.

69
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.720
And last but not least, I think I'm going to add some volumetric clouds to get some

70
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.400
nice clouds looking here.

71
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400
And there we go.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.720
We have our entire setup that we had before.

73
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.880
And it's just incredibly easy.

74
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.240
Out of the box Unreal Engine handles all of this for us.

75
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.360
So one thing to note is that, as you can see, I had to manually drag all of these out.

76
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.400
Now there's an easier way to actually build all of this.

77
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.160
So we're going to go ahead and delete everything once again and use the environment light mixer.

78
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.480
So it's a really nice little system that allows you to create everything that you need for

79
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.240
a natural lighting setup within one window.

80
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.840
So I'm going to go to window, environment light mixer.

81
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.280
And here I have essentially nothing yet because we have nothing that contributes to that global

82
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.760
lighting system.

83
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.960
So let's go ahead and start by creating a skylight, creating an atmospheric light.

84
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.520
We'll create a sky atmosphere, volumetric clouds, and a height of fog.

85
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.840
So we literally just created everything that we had before.

86
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.280
And you can see everything's kind of stacked up here, but you can see we've got everything

87
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.080
that we created earlier.

88
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.680
But one thing I am going to add is a little bit of rotation to this light once again,

89
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.160
just to get to the same place that we were.

90
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.680
So you can see with the environment light mixer really quickly without having to know

91
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.480
the names of all those things.

92
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.160
And Real already has a little setup for you.

93
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.520
Now what I really love about the environment light mixer is that in the past I would have

94
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.080
had to actually start clicking around these and changing the values individually to adjust

95
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.880
the scene to my taste.

96
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.400
Now what I love about the environment light mixer is that everything is here at a glance.

97
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.520
So I can change the intensity of the directional light if I want to.

98
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.360
I can change the color of the directional light.

99
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.760
All the properties that contribute to the lighting of this light can be edited within

100
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.480
the environment light mixer and can be seen at a glance with all the other things that

101
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.800
contribute to the overall lighting of the scene.

102
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.600
So this is something that I really love because I get to just not have to click around as

103
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.320
much and edit everything at a glance.

104
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.440
So really, really cool little system there with the environment light mixer.

105
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.800
Once again, we're going to delete because we're going to take a look at some of the

106
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
other setups that we have.

107
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960
So let's go ahead and delete this.

108
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.800
And the next one I'm going to drag in is one of the ones that we talked about we were going

109
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.740
to take a look at, but we didn't look at earlier.

110
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.720
So this one's the Sun and Sky Blueprint.

111
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.280
So I'm going to go ahead and drag it in and you might be blinded by the strength of the

112
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.640
light.

113
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.840
And the reason for this is that if we look at the actual blueprint under the details

114
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.360
Oh, sorry, it's the direction that I'm looking for.

115
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.600
And the intensity is 75,000 lux.

116
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600
It's trying to emulate the Sun essentially.

117
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.000
But the default exposure settings that we have here, we go to lit, you'll notice that

118
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.920
by default we had game settings.

119
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.940
And if you untick it, by default you have an EV100 of zero.

120
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.680
So I'm actually going to go ahead and bring this all the way up and I'm going to move

121
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560
to about 12.

122
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.720
And now you'll be able to see that our lighting makes a little bit more sense and we can see

123
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.160
what we're doing.

124
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.200
Now you can actually change these values inside of the post process volume under exposure.

125
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.880
We'll take a look a bit more depth, a little bit more in depth later along the line.

126
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.920
I just want to show you how to actually use these tools right now.

127
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.280
So when it comes to the Sun and Sky, one thing that's really cool about it is that it's set

128
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.440
up as an actual geographical analog of the real world.

129
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:32.880
So you'll notice that we have a latitude and longitude here and also a time zone, date

130
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.920
and solar time.

131
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.640
So what's really nice about this is that if you say, for example, want to recreate the

132
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.600
lighting at a particular point on Earth, let's say Chicago, a certain latitude and longitude,

133
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.400
you could enter those values and the Blueprint is going to update and change everything about

134
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.240
the atmosphere, directional light and skylight that is inside of this Blueprint to match

135
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.760
the lighting conditions of that latitude and longitude at that day, at that time.

136
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.320
So it's a really, really nice system.

137
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.360
Let's say again, you live in Chicago and want to get the lighting right for the same thing

138
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.160
that's outside your house on the 21st of September, this Blueprint has you covered for that.

139
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.000
It's actually really, really nice to be able to have essentially a digital analog of the

140
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
lighting setup of a particular location on Earth.

141
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.080
And I guess really useful for the AEC industry.

142
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.800
Now, the last thing I wanted to look at is the HDRI backdrop.

143
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.840
Once again, I'm going to delete and you'll notice that when I drag the HDRI backdrop,

144
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840
I can't see anything.

145
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.080
Remember, we edited the exposure to be much, much darker to compensate for that.

146
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.400
Since guys, I'm just going to click back to game settings and you'll see I've dragged

147
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400
in my HDRI backdrop.

148
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.120
I'm just going to move it down a little bit so we don't get that crazy Z-fighting.

149
00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.360
But you can see here that by default, I get the lighting contribution from this HDRI

150
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.360
image to my scene, which is really, really nice.

151
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.360
Now, one problem with this is that it does not come with a directional light setup.

152
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.360
So that's something that you have to do manually.

153
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.840
So if you bring in a directional light, you can rotate it, get essentially the right

154
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.440
light you need. I suggest you try to sort of follow the direction that the scene is

155
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.080
actually telling you to do.

156
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.000
So it'd probably be something more like this.

157
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.560
Assuming the sun's about that direction.

158
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.000
I can't actually see it on the scene, so I presume that's actually where it is.

159
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.680
So now we actually have a directional light.

160
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.600
Now, importantly, if you wanted to change the actual backdrop that you're using, you

161
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.320
can use your personal texture that you have yourself.

162
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.440
In our case, we're using this cube map.

163
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.600
If we go to the HDRI section here, we can drag in a different one to get different

164
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:04.200
results. Now, this is a nighttime setup, so it's essentially a moonlit scene, which

165
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
means that we would have to manually adjust it once again, our directional light to

166
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.280
match the values of the HDRI.

167
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.840
So in our case, we're just going to change the intensity to something like one, to

168
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.080
something more akin to moonlight, and maybe change the color.

169
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.960
We might even sample some of the colors of the scene here to get the correct look.

170
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.240
So this now feels like a moonlit environment using that information from the HDRI.

171
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.760
So they're the two sort of more out there blueprints in terms of lighting setups.

172
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.120
Let's go ahead and recreate that original lighting setup manually.

173
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.480
So let's go ahead and delete the HDRI backdrop.

174
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.440
And with the environment light mixer, we'll do it really quickly.

175
00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.760
So create skylight, atmospheric light, sky atmosphere, volumetric fogs, volumetric

176
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.680
clouds, and high fog.

177
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.000
And I'm just going to quickly select my directional light here and rotate it till

178
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.960
we get a nice look. There we go.

179
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.560
Perfect. So the last thing I want to take a look at here is some settings to improve

180
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.120
your reflection information inside of your scene.

181
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.320
Now, by default, the setup that Lumen has might not give you the best reflections for

182
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.000
AAC work. So let's go ahead and take a look at this.

183
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.400
I'm going to bring a sphere in.

184
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720
Bring it up.

185
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.000
And I'm going to go ahead and assign a material to it.

186
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.520
It's going to be a Chrome ball.

187
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.640
If you don't have access to this, it might be because you don't have access to engine

188
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.360
folders. In order to access the engine folders, all you have to do is go to the settings

189
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.040
here and make sure that show engine content is available.

190
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.560
Now, I have a Chrome ball here and you see the reflection that I'm seeing here.

191
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.160
It is reflecting what's behind me.

192
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
So that's a good start.

193
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.640
You can see the quality of the reflection isn't exactly amazing.

194
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:14.000
So if you have a good, powerful GPU that can handle hardware ray tracing, there's some

195
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.200
settings that you can actually change to make this much better.

196
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.960
So let's go ahead and take a look at those.

197
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.840
So I'm going to go to my project settings.

198
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.080
I'm going to make them a little bit smaller so we can see what's actually happening when

199
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080
we change things.

200
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.320
But we're going to go to the rendering tab.

201
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440
There we go.

202
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.960
I'll actually change the scene a little bit so we can see.

203
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.720
And I'm going to scroll down until I get to my glowing illumination system, which is going

204
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720
to be set to lumen.

205
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.440
And then my reflections here, which are set to lumen.

206
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440
So I'm going to go to the render tab.

207
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.440
And I'm going to go to the reflections here, which are set to lumen.

208
00:12:52.160 --> 00:13:05.640
Now, you'll notice that under the lumen setup, we want to be using use hardware ray tracing

209
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.640
when available.

210
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.240
Let's go ahead and tick that.

211
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.720
And you'll notice that instantly increases the quality of our reflection quite drastically.

212
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.800
And there's another couple of things that we can do to gain a little bit of quality here.

213
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.640
First of all, is that the ray light in mode here is set to surface cache.

214
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.120
I actually want to hit light in for reflection so you can see a little bit of a better result

215
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.160
here. And next is the software ray tracing mode.

216
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.120
I'm actually going to change this to detailed tracing.

217
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.320
And once again, you might see a slight gain in the quality of the reflection.

218
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.480
So much nicer reflection than what we had by default.

219
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.240
That's something to keep in mind.

220
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.200
When using lumen for AUC.

221
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.320
Now, these settings that I've just changed here, some of them can actually be accessed directly

222
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.000
through the post-process volume.

223
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.960
So if I scroll down and find my reflection settings.

224
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.120
Same thing here, right?

225
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.360
You can change your reflection method, the quality of the reflections and the ray light in

226
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.160
mode, which is set by the project default, which is what we just set earlier.

227
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.720
But if you wanted to change it to surface cache or hit light in from the post-process volume,

228
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.000
you can do that from here.

229
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.440
OK, so I think that about does it for this natural lighting setup.

230
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.800
After this, we're going to look at some additional tools that will help us debug and visualize

231
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.680
our scene in different ways to help us kind of read what might be wrong or what might be

232
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.920
able to be enhanced. And then we'll take a look at some artificial lighting as well.

233
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.400
So stay tuned for that.
