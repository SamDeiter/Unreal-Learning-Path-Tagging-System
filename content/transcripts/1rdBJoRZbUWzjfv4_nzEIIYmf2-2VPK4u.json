  "text": " So in part three, we'll talk about accent lighting. Lighting principles here, the best approach for this section is to isolate your lighting. So constantly check your scene against calibration tools that we dragged into the scene previously. For this class, we'll adhere to common lighting techniques, but feel free to improvise and let your creativity shine. Disable your overhead lighting and skylight, which we did in the previous workshop, but if you didn't disable the skylight and directional light, just make sure you do disable those. You can just set the intensity to zero there. And then we'll create lights one by one. So you can duplicate lights when necessary. So you can hold down Alt on your keyboard. If you've created a light that you want to reuse, just hold down Alt on your keyboard and drag using the widget and that'll duplicate your light. Then once the light is finished, disable it and move on to the next. The principle is to just do the lighting one by one and isolate the lighting. So once you've got a nice looking light, disable that, move to the next and then keep re-enabling the lights to adjust intensities and then balance. And then we can add the fills and kickers when necessary, just to add the lift to our scene. So this is something along the lines of what we'll be looking at here. A couple of the rec lights thrown into the scene. So we've got our overhead dominant rec lights, the two at the top that we previously created. And then we'll just balance out the scene, lifting the front, the side and the back, as well as just giving it some rim lighting from the back of the car there. And then for the kicker lights, you know, anywhere where it's just, you know, a bit darker or you just want some kicker lights in there, consider adding the lower attenuation radius to these scenes. Like we said before, sometimes it's just nice to isolate the lights, tackle things one by one and this is where you can lose a lot of time. So I'm just going to be moving around the scene. I'm going to be selecting things. If you want to hold select multiple things, I'm just holding down control on my keyboard. I'm going to lift this up a little bit, give that a bit more space. I might even bring down the intensity here to something more like 10,000, maybe even 8,000. I'll just lower that back bit a little bit. I'll bring these out of the way just so we can really get a feel for the car. And then what I'll be doing, I'll just be going through one by one. So you can do this in your own time as well. You know, feel free to just have a play around with the scene. Adding more rec lights, so I'm just going to be duplicating. I'm going to rotate. I'm just going to move this out. And again, it's essentially up to you how you edit these lights. So one thing I like to do, I've gone to some of these properties previously and edited them. This little cog here, you can show only modified properties, which if you're editing the same properties on rec lights, not only can you add them to your favorites, you can just say, oh, you've previously edited these properties, so only show these and it just removes a bit of the noise as you're trying to edit the scene. So maybe I'll bring down the radius a little bit here just so I'm not hitting that back wall. Pop down this intensity, maybe not that much. And again, I still want to be disabling my overhead lights in a second, but the width, maybe 600 and maybe 50 height, something like this. So again, coming back to this rec light, if we type, we need to make sure we disable. That's one of the things that can sometimes catch you up with. If you show only modified properties, make sure you untick that because only the properties that you previously edited. So if you're trying to find new properties, don't let that chop you up. I'm just going to set the visibility. I'm actually going to add visibility to my favorites because I want to be setting the visibility quite frequently on these lights. So I'm just turning off this visibility here and here. So I'm really only working with this. So if I turn off that, yeah, so that's looking all right. That lifts from there. And again, feel free to do this all yourself, just editing, manipulating the lighting, playing with the widths, playing with the intensities, maybe. It just gives you a little example of maybe a nice workflow with like buttons that you might be pressing, anything like this. Maybe I want to push that radius a little bit harder as well. Maybe even push that light in to see what kind of rim lighting we can get going on. But as well, you can set the colors. You can just have a play around with a lot of these settings. I said previously, if you show only modified properties, these are the properties that we edited before. So you want to be talking about the band all or in the sources and the intensity, radiuses. But apart from that, just have a play around. Then let's maybe just drop in here and add a few kicker lights just to show you the process. Now you could drag out a point light from here. I like to add a point light holding down L on the keyboard and left clicking. That creates a point light. Remember that you want it to be movable. The attenuation radius is going to be way too high there to start off with. So maybe something like 50 or 70 might work pretty well. Then you can just move these into areas where you want to lift any of the detailing. So again, have a play around yourself. Maybe 70 is a little bit low here. Just duplicating, moving things around, lifting any details that you want. It's still got the source radiuses and soft source. If you want more of a capsule instead of a sphere, you can change the source length and just add some length to that and then add the radius. So you can play around with things like this as well. This wouldn't make sense in this instance. I don't need this, but just to show you. If you had some lights up here. Just playing around really and just trying to get an overall feel for how you want this setup to look.",
