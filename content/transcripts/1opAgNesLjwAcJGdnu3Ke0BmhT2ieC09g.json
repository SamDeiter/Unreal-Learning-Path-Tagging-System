  "text": " Unreal Engine 5 Static Mesh Editor allows you to view and edit the properties of any static meshes that you have imported or downloaded from the Fab Marketplace. Inside of this editor, you can do things like enable Nanite, adjust LOD settings, or adjust collision settings, and even add sockets or disable properties that affect how the static mesh is rendered. You can also look at mesh properties such as vertex colors, the pivot, and even the normals. Let's take a look at this inside the engine now. Now to access this tool, all we need to do is simply double-click on any static mesh. Once we do that, it will automatically open up that mesh inside of the Static Mesh Editor, and then we can edit its properties on the right-hand side underneath the Details panel. Some other things to note here are the properties that we see on the left-hand side. This can give us information such as our triangles, vertices, UV channels, and approximate size. We can also view our UVs, our collision, and should we want to adjust the pivot of this by enabling the modeling tools. We can also re-import or re-import this mesh with dialog, which allows us to re-import this mesh with new settings. Finally, the save button allows us to save any of the settings that we have adjusted over here, ensuring that this will be saved to disk so that when we reopen this tool or use this asset in another location, those settings have been saved and applied.",
