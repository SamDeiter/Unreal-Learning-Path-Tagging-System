  "text": " So, we know now how to create a character and have them respond to input and have them animate as they do so, but what is the glue that binds all of these classes together? Let's take a look at how we set up a world in Unreal. There are two main classes that handle what game is being played. Firstly we have the Game Mode and this handles the rules for the current game. That could be how many players are allowed to connect, where do these players spawn and how many points will earn a team a win. The Game Mode is the intended home for this kind of logic. And in a networked game, the Game Mode is server only because we need it to be authoritative. The game's state, on the other hand, is a replicated actor that contains all of the pertinent information about the said game mode. Let's take Capture the Flag as an example. The Game Mode would handle actually capturing the flag and the allocation of the points. Those points are then stored in the game's state where any client can easily see them. There's also a third critical class that we can implement and that is the Game Instance. While the Game Mode and Game State are destroyed and recreated between levels, think of the score being reset when we move to a new map, the Game Instance is created as soon as the game exe is executed and persists across all maps. We use the Game Instance to store data that we want to transfer between levels. Building on our Capture the Flag example, say we pick the red team in the main menu. When we load into the actual gameplay map, we'd want the Game Mode to assign you to the team of your choosing. As the Game Instance persists, we can safely bring that data along from the main menu over into the main level. The Game Mode gives us exceptionally useful virtual functions to implement, allowing us to shape any kind of game mode that we would choose. The Game Mode is the default class that comes with the engine as of 4.14 and is a more streamlined version of Game Mode Base. With a lot of the convenience functions we'd expect of most standard multiplayer modes. As an example, we have the Init Game function, and this is called exceptionally early in the game flow. This is our initial kickoff and it's called even before the Pre-Initialized Components function. It's used by the Game Mode Base to initialize parameters and spawn any helper classes. Additionally, we have Pre-Login and this is called as new players request to join the game and it's ultimately in charge of accepting or rejecting that connection. It's called before the proper full-fledged Login function with a potentially non-trivial timing between the two, especially if the joining player has a lot of content to download before joining. We also have Post-Login and this is called after a successful login and it's the first place it's safe to call any replicated or networked functionality on the joined client. We've got a nice convenience function here called onPostLogin that can be hooked up in Blueprint for a designer to expand. So say we want to add some kind of UI sting to the screen saying someone has joined the game. Next, we've got the HandleStartingNewPlayer function and this is called after post-login. By default, it spawns the pawn in but we could extend it to do anything we want to, say changing the mesh of a particular player or assigning them to a team. Next, we've got SpawnDefaultPawnAtTransform and this is a function that actually does the spawning of that pawn. And finally, we've got Logout and this is called when a player leaves the game or is destroyed. OnLogout is called in Blueprint so say we want our player has left the game UI prompt to show on the screen. Any number of classes extending off of game mode can be created all with different rules. So your classic capture the flag, death match and search and destroy would all be game modes with their own sets of rules and methods for spawning players in. When talking about game mode as opposed to game mode base, we have access to match states. For example, we have the match state entering map followed by in progress and waiting to start. Waiting to start being your classic waiting for more players to join state. From there, we've got waiting post-match, say we want to view the player's scores or vote on the next level to travel to before proceeding into the leaving map state. The Unreal Engine goes through a game flow that determines when the necessary classes are initialized. Similar to the life cycle of an actor, how all this flows will depend differing on whether or not you're starting in the editor or launching a standalone game. So the first thing we need to notice is that when we start from the editor, we initialize the editor engine and then we start the engine proper. It's only once we've hit play in editor button that we actually create the game instance, whereas in a standalone game, we initialize our game engine and then create the game instance. From there, we can see that we differ slightly in the steps taken after the creation of the game instance. However, both paths eventually lead to calling begin play on the world. All of this information is worth bearing in mind when you actually come to decide where to place any of your game logic. As we can see with the spinning up of the game instance, it happens exceptionally early on in the process, whereas the game mode only exists when the gold is ready to start playing. The game mode can be set in a few ways. The first is to set it on a project level through the game map settings section in the default engine.ini config file with your usual i.i key pair syntax. We can also set it on a per level basis through the world settings tab in the editor. This is very useful when you want to consider non-game play maps such as the main menu. We may just want a level with no real gameplay rules, just a map to load into to act as an entry point for any player input. As mentioned previously, the game state is responsible for keeping track of game mode data. More specifically, it keeps track of the data that is intended to be visible to all connected clients. That might be the score, the time until the end of the game, the time since the start of the game or even the list of other players in the match. It's the game state that replicates down to clients, giving them access to the current state of the game, not the game mode. The game state shouldn't, however, keep track of specific player data. There's a class specifically for this called the player state which we're going to touch on in just a moment. The game state is trivially expandable. It's basically just a publicly accessible replicated class that contains data. So most use cases are to simply add additional variables depending on the game mode that you're authoring. Much like the game state, there is also a player state class and it's intended for much of the same uses. This is for storing player data, say your own score during a death match. After the following, we have a death flow that results in the pawn being destroyed, which is a fairly typical flow. We have our player die and let them get respawned through the restart player function in the game mode. But where do we keep their score? We could keep it in the player controller, but that doesn't really make much sense in terms of architecture. And this is where the player state comes in. We can add any number of variables to our player state and have them survive our game's death flow. The player state is also replicated and fully supports client to server remote procedure calls or RPCs because they're ultimately owned by the player controller. And this is going to give us a direct line of communication from the client to the server. The player state is set through the game mode. The game mode has a public member called player state class and it's here that we actually set the class that we intend to use as the player state.",
