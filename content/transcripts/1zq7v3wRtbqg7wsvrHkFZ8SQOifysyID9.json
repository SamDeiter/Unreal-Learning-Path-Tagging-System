  "text": " Sometimes with motion capture data you'll have to go and clean it or update it after the session. Motion capture software does allow for you to easily clean up data. With inertial you're getting the resulting skeleton and so you'll need to bring that animation software that will let you create joint rotations, hip placements, anything else that may be a little off or maybe you just want to make it a little closer to what you're expecting the data to look like. With optical data you can go into the marker level and replace a marker that's missing or that's flipped. So let's say we have a wrist that the system got confused and it placed the outer wrist as the inner and vice versa. That would mean your wrist is going to flip 180. You can go in the software and relabel them correctly and then reprocess it to get the data back to where you originally captured. If a marker is missing you can fix this too. Let's say your character is seated which will typically block the back markers. You can go in and say well here are the front markers even the side waist markers. Select those and the system will use those as a reference point to figure out where the back marker should be. It gets replaced then again you just resolve your skeleton and export your data back out to the way it was supposed to be when it was captured. Big suggestion we have for processing data is to have the director, the animator, whomever select the takes they really want to use because oftentimes you will do several takes of the same animation. So if you have a run forward you can have them run forward three times per take. Now we tend to have data recorded at 120 frames per second and that gives you a lot of keys to have to go through if they're giving you the whole take to clean up or several takes to clean up. It's much better to have them pick their best takes, pick frame ranges within those or even multiple frame ranges for you to clean that will give them their data back much faster you'll have more time to clean it giving them better results.",
