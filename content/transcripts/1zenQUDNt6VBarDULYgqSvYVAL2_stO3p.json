  "text": " So, the first thing we want to look at is what is a cine camera and how do they operate inside of Unreal Engine. So you'll notice that we have a scene set up from a previous course and the first thing I want to do is with my place actors tab, I'll just type camera and we'll find the camera actor. So we've got a few different camera settings here which we can dig into. We've also got the cinematics tab if you don't want to use the search bar and we've got them here. But let's go ahead and find the cine camera actor and let's drag it into the scene to see what we have here. So the first thing you'll notice is that we've got a camera mesh and you'll see a little window pop up of what this cine camera can actually see. And then we have also got some details along the side here if I just expand the window a tiny bit and there's a whole bunch of properties that we can dig into here. So we've got some look at tracking settings, we've got the film back, we've got the lens, we've got the focus and then we've got some additional camera adjustments that we can do mostly to do with post-processing. So you'll notice that in essence the Unreal Engine cine camera is similar to what a camera you might find in the real world. We can change the lens and we want to try and get this as close to the visual style as you intend it to be based on your real world settings. And we'll dig into some of these settings now just to give you an idea about how to control the camera. So the look at tracking settings, you can essentially, the main parameter here is the actor to track and you'll find that currently there's no actor to track. And so for example if we use this little pipette and we click on this mannequin that's standing over here, you'll see that it says okay actor to track is set as the mannequin and then you want the look at tracking. If I drag this line out here, you've got the interrupt speed and it essentially means how quickly do you want to track this character. So you could set something like one for example and then the main property you want to adjust here is look at tracking so you can tick yes. And you'll see that it interpolates to that character over the one duration. Now one thing you'll notice here is that the camera is looking at the mannequin's feet. Now why is this? Because the mannequin's root is at the base of their foot, the camera is looking towards the mannequin's root. And so what we also have is a relative offset that we can use. So if I hit this to 20 for example, it'll look up a little bit. If I set it to 50, maybe let's go 100 and again we're just trying to adjust for the number of units. So we're offsetting the camera based on the offset of what we want the mannequins from the offset of the root shall we say. A quick note here before we get even more into some of the settings, you can see already that we've manipulated four different properties here. And the thing that I like to do especially with working with cameras is if I go to edit and editor preferences, and this is completely optional, but I like to go to the favorite and favorable context menu, show favorites. Yeah, so I want to tick this. So from false to true and I'm going to close the editor preferences. I'm going to select off my camera, I'm going to go back to my camera. And the thing that I want to show here is toggle favorites, there we go. And we want to add to favorites. So we can right click, add to favorites and you'll see at the top here we've got enable look at tracking. Right click, add to favorites and you can see very quickly you can create a list of go to actions. So imagine you're changing for example the lens settings, the focus settings, many different settings in cameras every time and you have to keep scrolling through submenu. Sometimes your screen real estate is quite tight. If you have a set of favorites that you always go to and especially with cameras you tend to find this. It's sometimes useful to enable that favorites tab. So again, completely optional, just something that I like to do when working with cameras. But let's dig into a couple more settings now.",
