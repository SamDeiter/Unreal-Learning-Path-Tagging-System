  "text": " Now, before we jump in to using Grooms inside of the editor, I want us to take a quick overview look of what Grooms actually are so that we kind of understand the underlying tech a little bit better as this will help us make better Grooms that fit our visual needs. Now, when I talk about Groom or the Groom system, this is a system of tools that allow you to significantly improve the visual fidelity of your hair simulations, and that is accomplished by actually simulating every individual strand of hair that you have on your head. That is right, you heard that correct. When you're utilizing Groom inside of Unreal Engine, what you're actually doing is you are importing a series of splines that are used to then simulate hair and even fur or feathers. We can see this example right here. We have a head that each one of these little individual hairs you see here are a Groom, and then we also have these feathers which act as a Groom as well. Now, one thing to note that Groom inside of Unreal is utilized for displaying and optimizing as well as adjusting materials. If you want to do something to the hair that involves maybe shaping it or changing it or growing it or something like that, that's going to be done in your external modeling tool or your digital content creation tool, your DCC, using something like XGen within Maya, Omnitrax, Yeti, or Shave in a haircut, or even Houdini. So you'll use one of those DCCs to actually generate your Groom assets and then import that into Unreal where you can then add physics to it and adjust its lighting and material settings. Now, if you are, again, brand new or you'd like to take a look at some Grooms in action, the following Unreal Engine 5 samples all contain Groom examples. We have Valley of the Ancients, which is one of the first Unreal 5 samples that was released. And while this was heavily using Nanite and Lumen, it also utilizes Groom on the Echo character. Taking that one step further, the Sleigh animation sample actually shows you how Groom could be used in the context of a linear animation. And this sample, what we're doing is we're taking the Windwalker Echo character and then some linear content with it, which focuses mainly on the character. And by looking at this example, you can see a great use of Groom inside of linear content. And again, with some more linear content, there is the Meerkat demo, which when a digital was building to investigate how far they can push linear content, especially when it comes to fur and feathers. And with this example, you can really see how far you can push fur and feathers in real time. Last but not least, the MetaHumans, all MetaHumans utilize Grooms for their hair. So if you open up the MetaHumans Creator and you take a look at their hair or their beards or their eyelashes, all of that is going to be done inside of Groom. Now if you're kind of still wondering, well, you say working in Groom and your digital content creation and coloring, bringing it over into Unreal, what does that really mean? Well, what we're going to be doing in our DCC again is we're going to do our creation, our look and our styling. So if we want our hair to maybe have like an updo or we want some pieces that are flying off to the side or we have a ponytail or some short hair, we're going to do all of that look and styling and creation all in our digital content creation tool, utilizing whatever tool for hair and fur that we want. Once we're done and we're ready, we're going to export that as an Alembic file or a .abc and then bring that into Unreal Engine 5. Once inside of Unreal Engine 5, we're going to do things like the coloring, the rendering and the physics of the hair, as well as optimize it by adding level of details and things like that. So again, when we are dealing with our Groom, we're going to be doing a majority of the creation and the editing inside of our DCC. But once we're done with that, all of the visual updates will then happen in Unreal Engine 5. So now that we know a little bit more about Groom and what it does and how it works at a very high level, next we're going to take a look at enabling the Groom plugin so that we can actually visualize our Grooms inside of Unreal Engine 5.",
