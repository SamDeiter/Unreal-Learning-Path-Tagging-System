  "text": " Let's just finish out this tutorial by creating a quite a quick 3D UMG widget which creates some kind of stylized display in the world. So we'll create a new 3D widget which I'll jump into my editor here and show you and essentially we can just render the speed of the UMG in the actual world so we can see the speed changing to reflect the UI. So in the editor here just right click, user interface and the widget blueprint selected. I've called this 3D display menu. So if I open this up you'll see that we have the canvas panel in place, we have just a background color which you can see here width and height is 200 and then we've also got some kind of bar here which I've bound to a progress bar which I will dig into in a second here and we've also got the speed text which is the vehicle display which again will bound to a set text functionality which again we'll go over in a second here. Now the actual styling doesn't matter so much something along the lines of some text and a bar is good here, a progress bar and if we go into our vehicle blueprint now you can see that we've got this 3D widget component. So we can actually go to add and we can go to widget and you can actually add a widget into your blueprint and the widget class is going to be that 3D display widget. So you can see here if I just delete this empty one now you'll see that this 3D widget just has a location and a rotation kind of moved it out. We've got the widget class set here so now when you actually go into the map you can see this widget displayed in real time which is really nice if you want some kind of visualization that's actually presented in the scene rather than just 2D on the user interface. So go ahead and compile and save and let's look at the blueprinting involved in this display menu. So first of all we want to use pre-construct again so we've got our pre-construct if you just right click enter pre-construct and then we want to right click get player controller, drag off the blue player controller and display controller and then the display controller we want to get the hood reference and then we want to get the input UMG promote that to a variable set that as the input UMG reference so input UMG you just want to set that there. And then on the actual function side so when we've added functions we've got the speed bar which if we go back into the designer the speed bar we want to create a binding called speed bar and if I go back into here let's see what's going on. So we've got the input reference so we drag off here holding down control drag off we've got the car speed UI which is what we've created previously and you can just return that node there and then the set text in a similar way we can go to the set text we've got a bound event here so set text is our binding and essentially what we're doing in this function is we're getting the UMG again so drag out here we're getting our car speed UI we've got our map range clamped at 0 to 1 and then 0 to 150 on the out range and then we want to floor that value and in a similar way as we formatted the speed before if you drag out here type format text you want to type in speed and then add value in this the swirly brackets and then that will give you a value input which you can plug in that floor value there so that's essentially what we've got going on quick overview of a little UMG widget but hopefully that gives you an idea about is a similar functionality if we've done previously but instead of it being on the 2d interface we've now got this 3d widget which if we jump into the map now just check out what's going on if I just full screen this and press Alt and P you'll see that we've got our value in here we've got the car speed going up and down so you can see that that value changing and then the things that we've done before you'll see the airspeed changing and then also the temperature change in there so we've got some nice basic UMG functionality going on here again the styling could change but the main thing is that we've learned how to communicate between UMG and blueprints so let's go ahead and close out this tutorial in the next video",
