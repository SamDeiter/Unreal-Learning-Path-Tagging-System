  "text": " To create a new variable, all we have to do is click plus variable on the my blueprint tab. Then once we name it, I'll call this one example, we will be able to set its properties here on the right. If we have instance editable ticked on, this means that we are going to be able to change this variable for each instance that is created within the world. So if we have Boolean, for example, you could select it to be either true or false on each different instance. Blueprint read-only is going to mean that this variable isn't editable, which is great if you just want to set it and forget about it. We could also put in a tooltip. This will allow us to describe what it is for. Expose on spawn is going to allow us to alter this variable at the point that it is spawned into the world, much like instance editable. So these two are rather similar. We could also select for this to be exposed to cinematics, which is going to mean that this variable is accessible by a sequencer and can be controlled there. We can use this category in order to order and group our variables together for easier access. Now, at the moment, we would start off only with default. However, if we were to rename this category to something that doesn't exist, for example, example, then this would appear under the My Blueprint section. And also it would be available for future variables so that we could group them together this way. Also, you cannot put in the default value of a variable until you have compiled after creating it. Once you've compiled, you'll be able to see the default value under the default value section. And to save that, we would need to compile again. If you go to the variable type and hit the drop down box, you're going to see that there are a lot of different types that are available to us. The default in red is Boolean. This usually is used for a true or false value, with zero referring to false and one referring to true. Then in the different shades of green, we have some numeric variables. Byte being an 8-bit number, integer being a whole number with no decimal points, and float being a whole number that can include decimal bases. Next, in the shade of pink, we have some variables which work well with text values. Finally, these last three variables are usually used to work with 3D space. Vector is a group of three floats that are often referred to as X, Y and Z. Useful for things like pinpointing the exact location within a level, or it could be used to refer to the scale of an object across three different axes. The Rotator, again, is a combination of three floats, used to refer to the rotation of an object upon its different axes. The last variable here is what is called a Transform. A Transform is a combination of three vectors, one for location, one for rotation and one for scale. All actors that are created within the world have a Transform, so it is a common variable that we would use when referring to or controlling 3D movement. Below these variables, you can see that we have three different expandable sections, which will allow us to access a lot more variable types. Here we have Structurs, which are going to be a combination of variables which are customized for specific functionality. Interfaces, which will allow us to refer to a specific interface. Object types. These would help us reference different classes and actors within our project. And Enumerators, which are predefined lists of values. Another note, whenever you see this little eye next to the variable in the My Blueprint section, this just means that instance editable is selected. You can actually click on this to toggle the setting, much like you would do in the Details panel. One final point. All variables default to a single variable. If you wanted to make an array, for example, you could actually just click on this button next to the Variable types. Then on the dropdown, you could convert the variable to a single variable, an array or into a set or map. We will have a chance to work with different variable types as we go through the rest of this course. So just familiarize yourself with these at the moment.",
