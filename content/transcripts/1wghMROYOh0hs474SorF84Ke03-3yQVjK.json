  "text": " So first off, the server client model. We've talked about this in previous sessions, if you've watched any of the previous ones. But Unreal operates on an authoritative server model. So what that means is that really what the server says goes, that the server maintains the actual true state of things. Obviously, there's a discrepancy here when you're not doing multiplayer games. That's a configuration that's referred to as standalone. That essentially means you are playing the game locally, meaning the client and server are essentially the same thing. So in the situation of a single or local multiplayer, the client machine is essentially the server's machine. There's really no server. But it's worth mentioning that very, very early on, we talked about the idea that we had, I think this is in the first training session, we have these different pragmas that you could use to define whether or not the code you're working in is server code or client code. And that is true when you're in standalone or when you're in editor, that is true for both of those things are true. It is both client and server. So hypothetically, in standalone, when you're playing just a single player game or a local multiplayer, you are kind of a client and a server. So in that situation, the client is authoritative. We'll talk about what authority specifically means shortly. But yeah, it has full control over everything. All the data is local. We don't have to worry about data going to any other computers, to any other clients or the server. And we don't have to worry about data importantly coming from anywhere. Then we have the kind of other situation, which is a network setup. And what that means is the server is always fully authoritative and players that connect to the server are kind of referred to as clients. And as we said, it's the server that holds the true state of the game. In that situation, the kind of all relevant gameplay logic is, and definitely should be local to the server. But there are aspects of data that would be kind of remote either the server just doesn't care about, or technically the client would have authority over. Again, we'll talk about those in a little bit. And then where there's also kind of another configuration to kind of bear in mind where one of the players can be simultaneously the client and the server. And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a bit. So the types of servers, we've got dedicated, which is the kind of standard setup for a lot of the kind of competitive games you'll be playing online. So in this context, the server runs an entirely distinct machine. The server would run in a kind of headless configuration. Some people might refer to it as. This essentially means that the server doesn't need to be doing any of the things you as a player would typically care about in a game. It doesn't need to be listening for input. It doesn't need to render visuals. There are no local clients on this machine. So all the server is really there to do is process input changes, that like messages that might be coming from clients, kind of ticking the game over and just maintaining that authoritative state of the game and then dispatching that information to each of the connected clients. Yeah, and receives information from clients to verify. So that might be things like inputs and then clients informing them where the client thinks that their location is. And then alternative to that, we have the listen server. This is what I was just referring to a minute ago. This is essentially where a single client will also act as server. So this is not really a suitable setup for anything that is meant to be certainly competitive games or anything with a lot of players playing locally with a lot of players playing in a single session. It's not because of the kind of additional costs of rendering a screen, listening for input, hosting on additional kind of client configuration. There's only a kind of, there's a more limited subset of situations where a listen server is really acceptable. Most of the time that's gonna be probably more cooperative games because it's probably relatively obvious that if you are a listen server, your ping is going to be close to zero. So you're going to have a massive advantage over other players connected to your game. So if you're in a competitive environment, that's probably not gonna be suitable. And also when you're, even if you are doing some kind of cooperative game at scale, purely the extra cost put on your CPU of having to do all those kind of local client calculations, it's just gonna mean that it's not necessary such a suitable configuration. So dedicated server is gonna be suitable for all situations. Listen server is admittedly easier to set up, but it's really only gonna be suitable for probably non-competitive, probably small scope, like no more than four to eight players maybe kind of set up. The other thing about dedicated server, you might be familiar with this term, is that some games would choose to give out a copy of their game where you can turn your own computers into dedicated servers. So it depends, that's kind of a design decision on you as a developer of whether or not you want to expose the functionality to host, for players to host their own dedicated servers, or whether you want the acquisition of dedicated servers to be something that you purely do as a kind of proprietary thing where people would have to either purchase servers or you as a developer take on the responsibility of hosting all dedicated servers for your game. So just talking about like how someone actually, when a client is trying to join Connect to a server, let's just talk a little bit about how that process actually goes. There's actually a very good post in an Unreal documentation which I can kind of come back to, it kind of goes through a little bit in kind of more detail, but in the kind of like, in the broad scope of things, yeah, we just kind of go worth going over this kind of high level flow. So the first step is we have our client make a request for a connection to our server. At that point, the server can reject, accept or reject that connection request, there's some kind of like hand shaking that goes on. And then once the connection is accepted, the server is gonna send information down to the client for them to proceed. At that point, the server is gonna kind of tell the client what map to load, and then proceed to wait for the client to load the desired map. And once the server sees that callback, the pre-login function is called in the game mode, we talked about this in I think a second session or about the kind of game flow. And it's critical step, this kind of pre-login function, because it's at that point that you can inject gameplay code that can kind of choose to accept or reject that connection. So whilst we said the server decides to accept or reject the connection very early in the flow, that is not something that you as a developer would typically have access to unless you went changing engine code. The kind of point at which you as a developer would typically inject that the kind of capability to reject or accept a connection is gonna be in the game mode base pre-login function, which you can obviously override in your game mode classes. If that is then accepted by your pre-login, we then go on to call login game mode, and it said login that we would create the player controller on the server. And it's, as with all of this flow, we'll talk a little bit more about this, but whenever you create actors on the server, those actors are then kind of inherently replicated to the client. So that login function will create the player controller on the server and that then gets replicated as a client. It's also really important to note that the player controller will get its begin play called. So it's just understanding, it's important to understand where that's gonna occur and that flow will be at this point. And then lastly, the server is gonna call post login on the game mode. And that's basically the point at which it's now safe to call RPC functions on the player controller. You can expect those functions. We've not talked really about what RPCs are yet, but it's at the point of post login getting called that we can be certain that that connection is set up, that the client has that player controller and therefore RPCs are gonna kind of flow through to that client. As I said, there's a kind of more detailed post. It's, I believe it's actually by a member of the community, not an Epic dev themselves, but it just goes into this flow in kind of more detail and more kind of granular function by function call. You'll actually see this in the presenter notes. So if you're kind of more interested in like the kind of more specific detail about this, there's a good post about this in the dev on the Epic community forums. And that's actually part of the presenter notes in this presentation. So if you're kind of interested in following up on that, just follow that link in the presenter notes.",
