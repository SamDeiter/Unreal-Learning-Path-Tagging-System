  "text": " Now that we've gone over some of the nodes and functions that we'll be using, and we have an idea, a bit of an understanding of what procedural rigging is and its benefits, let's put that information into practice with a demonstration of building a simple FK rig. Now this will be a very basic rig that you'll be able to use on any of the Skeletor meshes within your own projects. So let's jump into the engine and get started. The first thing I'm going to do is create a new control rig. So by right-clicking the Content Browser, I'm just going to search for Control Rig, and then select Control Rig here. And we want to use just a standard control rig rather than Modular Control Rig. And I'll call this CR underscore Simple FK. And I'll just double-click this to open it up. Now in here, what we typically do is import the hierarchy for our character that we're building this control rig for. Or we would even create the control rig directly from our Skeletor mesh inside the Content Browser. But with a procedural control rig, we need to do something a little bit different. So we need to import the Skeleton into the rig hierarchy here by using the construction event rather than importing and then choosing our Skeletor mesh from this dropdown. And this way, we can use this Skeleton, sorry, Import Skeleton node to pick up any updates that might have been made to the Skeleton or account for changing Skeletor meshes whenever we want to use this control rig. So the first thing I'm going to do is right-click and search for the construction event. And this is where we're going to build all this sort of preparation logic. So importing our Skeleton and creating and positioning our controls. So if I pull off here and search for Import Skeleton. Now this is not, on this node is not where we set the Skeleton that we want to import into the preview inside the control rig. But instead, under the Preview Settings tab here, if we set our preview mesh to be SKM Mani Simple, you'll see that instantly our rig hierarchy here is populated with the Skeleton. And you can see that it's been procedurally generated because it has a yellow text instead of white text. And if we were to change this Skeletor mesh to the MEC for example, you can see that that automatically updates this rig hierarchy here for whichever Skeletor mesh we choose. So I'm just going to bring it back to SKM Mani Simple. Now if we were to make any changes to the Skeletor mesh for any reason, they'll automatically get brought in. So now that we have this information, we can start to build the logic to create our controls. And because this is a simple FK rig, what we're going to do is create just one control for every bone in our Skeleton. And to start the logic for that, what we need to do is find all of the bones in the Skeleton to build that logic from. And we'll do that with the Item Name Search node. So if I right-click, search for Item Name Search. And the nice thing about this node is you set the type to Search, and if you set this partial name, if you leave that as None, what it will do is it will find everything of the type that you've set to Search. So we could put, for example, spine, whoops, if I spell that right, spine underscore in here. And the information that comes out of this array will be everything inside this list, inside that rig hierarchy, that is a bone and contains the name spine underscore. But in our case, if we set this to None, if I delete everything, then hit Enter, that just means it will search for everything of this type. And in this case, it's the bone. And for each individual item in the array here, we want to run some logic to create our controls. So if I pull off this Items and search for For Each, and then connect to PowerLogic, this is going to say, okay, for each of the items in this array, do X. And in our case, that's going to be Create a Control. So to create these controls, we're going to use the Spawn Transform Control Mode. So if I just search for that here, this is our Spawn Control Mode here. And if we connect up the logic, and then connect the element pin to the parent pin to create a hierarchy, and then on the initial value here, right click and change that to a Transform You'll see that straight away, we've got controls created for all of the bones inside our skeleton. But there's one problem. All of these controls are now inside the skeleton hierarchy. And if you've built rigs or spent time building rigs before, you know that that's not a good practice to maintain. And as well as that, they don't have any proper names yet. So for the next step, let's name our controls. And then let's also put them in the correct hierarchy. Let's put them in their own control hierarchy. So to name the controls, I'm just going to give us a bit of space here and open up the element pin. I'm going to pull off the name pin and search for Concat. And what we're essentially going to do with the Concat node is add something to the end of the name. And in this case, we're going to put underscore CTRL. And we'll plug that into the new name, the name pin of our spawn control node. So now you can see that all of the names have been updated based on the names of their bones. So we've got the middle01, middle01 control, middle02, middle02 control, and so on for that whole rig. And next, let's fix the hierarchy of our controls. So we'll bring them out from the bone hierarchy and get them into their own controller hierarchy. And we'll do that by setting the hierarchy to find the parent of each control. Now this is going to break our transforms for a moment, but that's something we'll fix afterwards. So from our element pin here, what we're going to do is drag off and search for Get Parent. And this is going to find the parent of each of our elements. If I just disconnect this here and give us some more space. So this will find the parent of each of our bones, and that's going to help us build a hierarchy. But what we want to search for really is the parent of all of our controls. So if we pop open the parent pin here and search for Concat again, I could just duplicate this, but all we need to do is type underscore CTRL. And then inside our parent pin of the spawn transform control, we're going to connect that to the name pin. And the important thing to change here is the type that we're searching for. And that's going to be control. So we want to find essentially all of the controls with this name, and they will be the parent of our new controls, which we're creating based on the bones and adding underscore CTRL to the end. So you can see we've got all our controls here. They're all in their own hierarchy. However, they're all at world zero currently. And now to fix that, we need to take the transform information from our bones and apply that to the controls. And we'll do that with a get transform node. So if we drag off our array element or for each element and search for get transform, this is going to find the transform of each of the bones in our array. And what we want to do is we take our output transform information from all of these bones and plug it into the offset transform of the spawn transform control node. An important thing to check here as well is that make sure you're in local space. By default, this is global space. And what you might find is the controls kind of fly around everywhere. But if you change that to local space, that should fix those issues. So we now have a control created for all of the bones within our skeleton. And they're all in the correct hierarchy. They're all in their own control hierarchy down here. And again, because they're yellow, you can see that they're being spawned procedurally. So if we were to just disconnect this bit of logic here, you'll see all of those controls disappear. And if we reconnect it, again, they all get recreated. When it comes to the settings for the controls, you have some options to do things like change the rotation order. You can even set limits for the translation and rotation, things like that. And something very useful is to be able to change the shape, so the actual look, the color, and the transforms of the control itself. So we could come in here and change the actual shape of the control. And that will update every control that we've created with this spawn transform control node. You can update the color here, or you could also jump into the details panel to do that. And you can also update the transforms. So if, for example, you wanted to change the scale of anything, you would set those details just down here.",
