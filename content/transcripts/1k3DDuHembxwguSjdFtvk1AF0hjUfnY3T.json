  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at Path Tracer, setting it up and then looking at some of the settings for quality control. So let's get started. So we see here, Path Tracer uses the same ray tracing architecture as other ray tracing features such as real-time ray tracing, GPU light mass, and making it ideal for ground truth comparisons. So basically, it's mainly for production settings. This is not for a real-time scenario. So you wouldn't be making a game with this. So such clients as ArchViz, Film, and TV customers are going to be the main ones who are going to use this. Setting these renders out to MovieRenderQ. The advantage you get is you get refractive glass, GI and reflections, subsurface scattering, and etc. You get some really nice realistic renders and visuals at a lower cost. So it doesn't take as long to render this compared to a CPU offline render. The Path Tracer only uses geometry and material present in the scene to render its unbiased result, and does not share the same ray tracing code that has been developed to work for real-time rendering. So again, keep that in mind, not for games. If ray tracing is kept on, you want to switch between Path Tracer view modes and lit modes, which I'll show you in just a second. This will allow you to see the visuals. Now you'll notice that materials are very different. Let's jump in Unreal and I can demonstrate that real quick. So in Unreal, I have a Path Tracer scene here, and you'll notice my visuals are set to Path Tracer. Now if I hit Lit, which is regular like ray tracing mode, because we are in ray tracing mode, you'll notice the materials do not digest the same, because I've made the materials a certain way to accommodate for Path Tracer, and I'm using ones that even lean towards or can be used with Path Tracer, ones that we've made with that in mind. So I'll go ahead and switch that back to Path Tracing. And we'll talk about these materials in just a second. So let's look at setting it up. We're going to go to Rendering Hardware Ray Tracing. We're going to make sure we support hardware ray tracing. We're going to make sure that we turn on Path Tracer. And also, we want to make sure that in our RHI, you can actually do a search for that for RHI, and you want to turn on DirectX 12. Now, by default, that should be active. But if you're getting something from the marketplace, make sure you double check it. Engine Rendering Optimizations, we want to make sure that we have support, computes can catch. Once active, you can change your light mode, and you will be able to see the results. In Unreal, depending on what you're clicking on, we'll tell you to restart. So once you get that set in, you want to bring in a post-processed volume. We've demonstrated how to do that in the past. Once you bring it in, control your exposure. So there's something I do want to mention about your exposure. You'll note here, the Max Path Exposure, which you see right here, needs to be a few steps above the overall exposure. So whatever exposure you have, to support any emissive materials. So if you don't, your emissive materials won't be supported correctly. So keep that in mind when you're in the Path Tracer settings in the post-processed volume. So let's talk a little bit about this post-processed volume control here that we have. So you'll notice we have Max Bounces. This controls pretty much what it says. The bounces of our GI in our scene. Three and five can help for performance, but 32 is default, and actually works pretty well. The samples per pixel are default at 2048. 1600 is ideal, but in class, typically in a live class, I'll do 500. In this particular case, we have ours set to 300. Let's look at that briefly. So in here, you'll see that I have 300 for my samples per pixel. You'll see that my max path exposure is set to 30. I could probably lower that compared to my exposure overall. And I have a reference depth of field. Now this enables reference quality depth of field, which replaces the post-process effect. So the reason why you would use these, and also I want to turn on reference atmosphere. There we go. If we have any atmosphere in here. So this is also going to help. Both of these are going to help. This is going to help with depth of field. So the depth of field is sorted correctly. And I'll briefly mention that in the slides, because in the past, we had a problem with that, where the transparency will look like it's pushed forward when it should be pushed back. And this is very helpful for that. You'll notice there is a reference atmosphere here. So this enables path tracing in the atmosphere, instead of baking the sky atmosphere contribution into a skylight. So this actually can help pull some realism in here. And any skylight present in the scene will be automatically ignored when this is enabled. So if we turn this on, it's going to try to use the default. So if we want to, we can actually leave it off. That option is available there. We do that for both. There you go. The reason why some people ask, why is there two tick boxes? It's almost like one to check it, one to activate. Just so that is parsing correctly. You'll also notice here towards the bottom, we have right underneath path tracer, I should say, a lighting component. Now this is one wasn't addressed in earlier classes, but you can actually isolate and turn things off if you need to, if you don't want your light to affect certain aspects of your scene. So a little bit more geared towards where you can do this in Lumen. And you should be able to do this in baking mode, but these allow you to isolate things if you need to for any particular scenario. So again, we have the max bounces for control, samples per pixel. We have filter width, sets the anti-aliasing filter for path tracer. Lower values gives you sharper and then higher softer. We have emissive materials activated. So you can actually turn that on so it's calculated or not, it's up to you. We have max path exposure set slightly higher than overall exposure. So you wanna make sure you do that. And I said that earlier. So we also have reference set to field. We talked about how that remedy sings and the denoiser, always wanna keep this on. You can turn it off to test things out, but overall the denoiser is gonna be very helpful for you. So again, looking at that reference set to field. Now again, that solves that issue I mentioned earlier, when it comes to not being able to render things correctly with your transparent object. And that's why in the material you would do like before depth of field, you would do that from after tone mapper to before, I should say tone mapper, not depth of field. So before tone mapper and after tone mapper, you have that switch to turn it on and off if you run into that sorting issue. This solves that so you don't have to lean so much on that. So do test it out. Every scenario is a little bit different, but that should fix some of those issues that may have come about. That's it with this lesson. In the next lesson, we're gonna take a look at some material features that we've implemented for Path Tracer. Thanks again.",
