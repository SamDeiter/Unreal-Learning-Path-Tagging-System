  "text": " So we'll begin by recapping what the Unreal Engine building blocks are. Unreal offers many established classes that provide core functionality out of the box and going through these will help put the rest of this talk into a better perspective. We'll only briefly touch on these as I'd highly recommend that you watch our previous talk, that being an introduction to Unreal Engine 4 for programmers, into which we do a deeper dive into these topics. As mentioned previously, UObject is the base class for all UE4 types, including all assets inside the Content Browser. They have no physical representation in the world and they have no built-in tick functionality. As they've got no concept of the world, they have no ability to update per frame. They must be given an outer. This is the object that this object resides in. If one is not given an outer, it's put inside the transient package, which is the topmost package used for storing temporary objects, which should not be saved. Objects can support networking, but they do not come with it set about the box. If networking is required, perhaps reconsider whether or not UObject is the right solution for your current technical requirement. As an example of a UObject, we have the UExplosionData asset, which is used to define properties regarding an explosion. Actor extends directly off a view object and is usually accompanied by a scene component as its route, giving it a physical representation in the scene. For example, consider an exploding barrel. This would be an actor, consisting of smaller, discrete pieces of functionality and a physical representation through some flavor of mesh. Actors do have networking support by default, giving us access to RPCs like we discussed earlier, as well as standard variable replication. They're exceptionally well suited to a component-based architecture as opposed to a giant monolithic class. So at this time consider the following. If my current technical design requires either networking or ticking, go with actors and If you don't require either, consider using the UObject. Actor components allow us to roll functionality into a single class. They require an actor to exist because they cannot simply exist in the world. They're designed to be part of an actor. And they're excellent when used in conjunction with Blueprint to expose our parameters to design with sensible UProperty use. So as an example, we can add an explosion component to our exploding barrel actor and keep the actor class completely unpolluted. If another actor in our game requires some kind of explosion functionality, we can simply add the component to that class as well without having to duplicate anything. We can also add UProperties to the explosion component to allow design to plug in an explosion data asset in as a field, letting them balance and tweak the functionality separately. Actor components are not particularly ideal for networked functionality, as dormancy can only be set on an actor level as opposed to a component level. A dormant actor will send all of its components dormant as well, so we may end up with erroneous or unacceptable behavior as the project grows. A scene component extends off of actor component with the benefit of providing a physical representation in the scene. They can be attached to other scene components as well as bones and sockets. They can also be used to detect collisions and overlaps. It's the scene component that gives a base actor its physical representation in the scene. An actor itself has got no intrinsic transform, but it does have a root component, which is a simple scene component giving us our scene representation. With the recap over, let's take a look at the player. What classes and concepts do we need to be familiar with in order to get a player up and running? The Pawn offers the entry point for actors that can be possessed by either a player or the AI. By default, the Pawn class gives a physical representation in the scene, but it's otherwise a plain canvas for us to build from. Pawns have a one-to-one relationship with controllers, meaning each Pawn can only have one controller and each controller can only control one Pawn. It's important to note that the Pawn is not assumed to be humanoid and it does not provide any default movement, skeletal mesh or collision components. It only provides a default scene component, that being its root component. The Pawn extends off of the Actor class and as such has access to some of its core functionality such as its location and rotation manipulation. In Blueprints, we can quite easily add movement to our Pawns using the Set Actor Location function like we just discussed. This function allows us to either teleport the Pawn from its current location or we can perform what we call a sweeping move. The sweeping move essentially slides the Pawn from point A to point B, stopping as soon as they collide with any geometry. Pawns spawned during gameplay are not automatically possessed by a controller. However, we do have some options exposed out so we can have some semblance of control. So let's take a look at those in the editor. So whilst Pawn gives us a base for all controllable Actors, the default Pawn and Spectator Pawns build on top of that to provide us some out of the box functionality. The default Pawn provides us with the following components. We're going to get a default Pawn movement component, a spherical collision component and a mesh component. It also provides built in functionality to add default movement bindings which are on by default, cutting out the need for any manual adding of movement logic to your Pawn whether that be native or Blueprint. The movement that it offers is as follows. We get forwards, backwards, left, right and jump. The default Pawn movement component offers a no gravity, flying style movement as the Pawn is not assumed to be humanoid. The default Pawn movement component exposes controls over maximum speed, acceleration and deceleration to Blueprint. The Spectator Pawn on the other hand is a subclass of default Pawn and provides us with a simple framework ideal for spectating functionality. Like default Pawn, it offers much the same components but it does away with a mesh component as Spectators typically don't have a mesh. The Spectator Pawn does however provide its own movement component, that being the Spectator Pawn movement component. It's largely the same as the default Pawn's movement component with added functionality for handling or ignoring time dilation as necessary. A character is a humanoid style Pawn and it is assumed to be vertically orientated. The character brings with it its own movement component which offers a greater range of movement than the Pawn movement component, allowing characters to walk, run, jump, fly, fall and swim through the world. The character movement component is heavily networked, making it the perfect type to use when thinking about our networked games. The character is the first class along the Pawn hierarchy to provide specific functions for crouching and jumping, as well as overriding several variables and functions to specifically facilitate replication inside the character movement component. Unlike Pawn's, the character comes with a skeletal mesh component which enables us to make use of animations. The native skeletal mesh provided by the character is also the main skeletal mesh associated with the character, but more skeletal meshes can be added to the character as we see fit. The character also offers some animation functionality such as allowing us to play and stop animation montages both in native and in blueprint. It also provides a capsule collision component straight out of the box. As mentioned previously, the character is assumed to be vertically orientated and this is due to the functionality provided by the capsule collision component, which in order to calculate complicated geometries make this assumption. The character movement component is a component specially created to be paired with a character. It provides encapsulated movement systems for humanoid characters which are assumed to be vertically orientated. It handles movements such as walking, running, swimming, falling or flying and it's built with networking in mind with the aforementioned movement modes built to replicate straight out of the box. As mentioned before, it is created to be paired with the character in mind as the character class overrides variables and functions that facilitate the networking side of the movement component. Character movement modes can be created and can be handled by the character movement component directly, given the developer complete control over how their custom movement mode is handled when it comes to updating the character's position, as each movement mode handles its own movement logic, for example. If the movement mode is move walking, then it will call the fizz walking function. The character movement component isn't blueprintable, so for handling custom movement modes outside of native implementations, it's usually recommended to handle it inside the character blueprint directly using the update custom movement blueprint event that's fired when a custom movement mode is processed. So now that we know what a pawn and character is, we naturally have to discuss controllers. Controllers are a non-physical actor that possess pawns or a pawn-derived class. This is done through the possess and unpossess functions, both of which are available in native and blueprint. The base class for controllers is the AController class, and this class defines some of the core functionality of a controller, and also makes use of the class specifiers abstract and non-placeable. The form of these specifiers works as you'd expect, it marks the class as abstract and therefore cannot be instantiated directly, while the latter marks the class so that it cannot be clicked and dragged into the editor. As discussed previously, they have a one-to-one relationship with a pawn, and this is usually desired by most game types, but they may not meet all requirements where possession of multiple pawns may be desired. Controllers also receive many notifications of events that occur for the pawn, and this gives developers the opportunity to implement functionality for the given event and supersede the behaviour that the pawn may trigger. It's also possible to make the controller tick before the controlled pawn, which can be used to minimise latency between input processing and the pawn's movement, an important thing when it comes to player controllers. Controllers do not expose transform functions to derived classes in native. Controllers attach themselves to their pawn when they possess, and detach when they unpossess. So what types of controller does Unreal give us out of the box? Well as the title suggests, Unreal gives us the player controller and the AI controller. Player controllers represent the human player's will. Player controllers are flexible and a key tool for developers when considering the gameplay loops of their games. For instance, they can be used to handle the input notifications rather than the pawn. It's important to consider what functionality should be placed in the player controller over the pawn. So for example, if you have a game in which the player can swap around many characters, then it would make sense to implement the input handling within the controller as the controller can simply relay those commands onto the currently controlled pawn. The player controller, unlike the pawn, persists as only one is created for that player when they're loaded into the map, whereas pawns are transient. If your game has a gameplay loop in which the player's character dies and respawns, Unreal will destroy the current pawn upon death and a new one will be assigned to the player when respawning, but importantly it will be controlled by the player's existing player controller. AI controllers on the other hand are exactly as you'd expect. They are the simulated will of an AI agent.",
