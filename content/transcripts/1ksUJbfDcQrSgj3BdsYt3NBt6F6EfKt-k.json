  "text": " So we're on the home stretch now. The last thing I want to talk about that is a little bit more sizeable was programming subsystems. Obviously, as your game begins to grow, it increases the chance that you may want to go editing some of the engine source code. The source code is freely available, debugging symbols are available, you can go to the GitHub and download the source built version of the engine if you want to customize that engine. Something I would encourage you to think about first for both portability and several advantages really is subsystems. So subsystems are essentially automatically instanced classes of various sections of the engine. They have managed lifetimes, meaning you don't have to control when they come in and when they go out. They're inherently linked to a particular part of the engine and they share the lifetime of that part of the engine. This helps us get around overriding engine classes, which can reduce compile times, it can keep things more modular and portable and more easy to share sections between different projects and it exposes access to functionality to Blueprint and Python. Some examples of typical subsystems that you might want to inherit from are engine subsystem, editor subsystem, game instance and local player. There's also world and really a host of others where we've already talked about the local player enhanced input subsystem. There's a lot of these, if you look up subsystem you'll find them, but these are the key classes that you would typically want to possibly expand upon. So just talking a little bit about the lifetimes. Some of this is maybe going to be a little bit obvious, but it's worth just mentioning anyway. Like we said, the lifetime that each of these subsystems has will be shared by the engine system that they are attached to. So for an engine subsystem, they are initialized when the engine module gets its startup function called and de-initialized when the engine module gets its shutdown function called and it can be accessed through G engine in C++. Editor subsystems, similar, it's when the editor module gets its startup and shutdown called and can be accessed through G editor. Game instance subsystem, we talked about the game instance flow earlier in the talk. So it's initialized when the game instance is initialized and de-initialized when the game instance is shut down and you can access that through C++ at least by grabbing a reference to the game instance. So most objects, most U objects in the game have access to the game instance because it's something that exists kind of above all of them. I'll show an example of that on the next slide. And then last of all, we have the local player subsystem. So these are initialized and de-initialized as the local player is created and destroyed. That may not necessarily be at the beginning of your game depending on if you dynamically create new players partway through your game process. And there is a local player subsystem for each player. So this is kind of like somewhat distinct from the rest of these. It would only have one. For each of these, there will be a subsystem for each local player. And each of these subsystems can be accessed in the same way through getting a reference to that local player in C++ and then that can be from the player controller. And then through that, you would access that subsystem. So just in terms of actually performing that accessing, that was all the C++. Here's an example of how that might look in C++. So if we wanted to get a game instance, if we just made a my game instance subsystem, which inherits from game instance subsystem, we would get our reference to the game instance. Normally you can just call this function get game instance, and then you just do get subsystem. And this is a generic type. So that just casts it for you into the type that you need. But in terms of accessing it through Blueprint, it's actually quite a bit easier. Every time you make a subsystem, it will automatically get added into this list. So if you just look up subsystems, these options will kind of like populate through what's available. And then accessing it would just look like this. Again, we've already seen an example of this through the enhanced input local player subsystem. And then the last thing really to touch on is that, like we said, this is available through Python through just unreal.getEngine subsystem or getEther's subsystem, et cetera. And then you just provide the type of subsystem that you're looking for. Worth mentioning that Python is in development, it's still quite an experimental feature, but just worth highlighting that one of the advantages of making these subsystems in the first place is it does expose it to Python if that's something you want to try using. Okay, so homestretch. This is the last content slide. But just something that's worth mentioning is that when you're coding these things, obviously With video games, a lot of the time we might be reusing things that other people have solved before. Engines in general solve some of those problems for us. But it's just worth pointing out that there's a kind of suite of function libraries available to us that will do some of the things that you might be wanting to do already. Some of this, a lot of these are actually exposed to Blueprint. So any of these, youKismetSystem, KismetMath, Kismet is the old name for Blueprint. So KismetSystemLibrary, KismetMathLibrary, YouGameplayStatics, these are all function libraries that are exposed to Blueprints. FMath is only for native, although a lot of that is actually getting used through the KismetMathLibrary. And so, but they're not exclusively for use in Blueprints. So you can also access these through C++. And they are essentially libraries of static functions. So it's very easy through C++ to just do YouKismetSystemLibrary colon colon and then use one of the functions on it. It's also, you can kind of just give an example of these actually being used if we just go into our level Blueprint and we just did something like Spawn Actor from class. That is a, oh, that's a custom node. Well, we just talked before about the save game to slot, didn't we? And then if we hover over this, you can see this comes from GameplayStatics, which is one of the ones we're talking about here. Normally, if you want to see where a, if you want to kind of look at a little bit more, you just kind of want to jump from some code, from some Blueprint into code, you can double click. And as long as your ID is set up OK, it will actually jump to that point in code. But I tested this before, for some reason it's not working for me. But normally this would take us into the GameplayStatics class and straight to that function, just so you can kind of browse around and see exactly what it's doing. And yeah, the last thing that I want to mention is just that you can actually make some of these libraries yourselves. So these ones are the ones that are available to you off the bat. And they do a lot of things for you. The FMath one is used for just a lot of things you typically need to do with mathematical functions, things like abs or max or min or lerping and things like this. But you can also make and expose your own Blueprint function libraries. So all you have to do is make a class that inherits from you Blueprint function library and then make the functions on its static. And as long as they are, you do need the same markup above them with the U function Blueprint callable. And that will expose it to Blueprints. It is also worth mentioning that Blueprint function libraries are encouraged for a number of different reasons. But actually, the same is true really of any time you make a static function on any U object and have that U function Blueprint callable metadata above it, it will actually be exposed to your game. So just as an example with our exploding barrel from last session, if I just put a static function here, some static function for my barrel and put U function markup above it and make it Blueprint callable, even that is accessible from some function, even that is accessible from Blueprint. And you can see that the class is calling on this exploding barrel. So I might have given you some power that you're going to abuse there, but just kind of worth highlighting that you can create these things yourself. It gives you a lot of ability to expose functionality to designers that they may not necessarily have the programming capability to do themselves. OK, and I think that brings us to the end. We covered this in the last session, but just kind of resources and support available to you. The Unreal Engine documentation, always incredibly useful. Unreal Engine YouTube, we have spotlights, there's updates about new features, there's live chats and stuff there. A lot of those streams go through to YouTube, but they do originate from the Twitch. And then we've got the Unreal Developer Network for licensees, where you actually get support from Epic staff. Unreal Answer Hub is amazing, very vibrant community from Unreal developers. If you aren't a licensee and you get a lot of pretty quick answers there. And then the Unreal Engine community wiki has lots of amazing tutorials and documentation as well. So for any of this stuff, you can kind of follow up and go into more detail there. Thanks very much for watching.",
