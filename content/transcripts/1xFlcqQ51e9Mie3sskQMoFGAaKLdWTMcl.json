  "text": " Continue working on your level, or you can open the Three Sun Adjustments map to carry on. Let's try to get the sun to give us an interesting lighting scenario that leans toward the end of the day. Select the SunSky system in your scene, and let's see what it looks like around 1800 hours or 6pm. You can already see it has an effect on the general tone, with the colors getting warmer. You might have also sensed a sudden light exposure compensation that brightened the scene gradually. We'll address that in a moment. First, let's see how we can make the shadows more interesting. Right now, the position of the sun is not doing that plaza any favors. Change the North Offset to get the sun positioned on the opposite side. A value of about 190-200 degrees should work fine. You can also fiddle with other parameters such as latitude and longitude to get a position in the world. The default values point to Montreal, Canada, as this is where the tool was developed. In the Details panel, you can see that the SunSky system is made of various components. The Directional Light component represents the sun, and if you select it, you'll note the intensity is set to a high value of 75000 lux. You'll also note that the sunlight is set as a movable light, and this means it's entirely dynamic. It is not meant to cater for any light baking in this project. While the high intensity tries to mimic the physical properties of the sun, it can have an adverse effect on other parts of the scene, such as having to boost up the intensities of man-made lights before you can see their effects in the scene. The effect of a sun with a strong intensity is made quite palpable when you go into play mode as exposure compensation kicks in quite heavily. You could opt to use the Sun Intensity at a much lower value and then adjust exposure to our global linear scene. Try a value of 100 lux for the sun, and see the effect when you try play mode. The difference in exposure compensation is much less dramatic. Let's try to keep that exposure in check. For that, we'll be using a Post Process Volume. The Post Process Volume adds the finishing touches to your rendering. Here we'll use it to control lens exposure. We already have one in the scene, courtesy of that original main level we started with. You'll find it in the Essentials folder you created earlier. Go ahead and select it. Check the Exposure Settings in the Details panel. Note the Minimum and Maximum EV parameters. Enable them. They are currently set to range from minus 10 to plus 20, giving you a vast exposure field to compensate for. Let's reduce it. In fact, let's remove it altogether by zeroing out both values. In fact, let's remove it altogether by zeroing out both values. The exposure changes in the viewport but now you can adjust it without allowing it to change your setup against your will. Try an exposure compensation value of about minus 1.5 or minus 2. That should work well. Save your work. We will revisit the Post Process Volume again but first, let's keep building our scene. Next, you'll use the Fold Each tool.",
