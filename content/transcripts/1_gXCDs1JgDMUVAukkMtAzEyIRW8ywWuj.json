  "text": " Let's take a look now at our actual Unreal Engine project. You'll notice I'm in the map called lighting underscore finished. And this is essentially what we'll be building to over the course of this course. You'll see over here, we've got a folder called Corbero House. And again, this is by Zebra Corbero. Basic architectural elements here, arches and whatnot, all coming from some basic CAD. And let's look a little bit at what we have in the scene. So you'll notice the sky here. This is an HDRI backdrop. And that's where we're getting some of our light. We also have a number of lightmass portals that are helping to collect the rays of light coming in from the sun and making sure that they penetrate into the space accurately and correctly. We have some spotlights over here that are using IES files to cast light. And those will be more prominent if we are considering the night scene. We can also note that we have some reflections going on over here. And if we look closely, we'll notice that there's a couple different reflection types going on here. We have screen space reflections as well as a box reflection capture. And we'll go over more about that shortly. We also have an object here in the center, which is giving off a bit of a glow. And that tells us we have screen space global illumination enabled. We also have for lights our skylight, which is set to movable and is providing the ambient lighting, you could say, for our scene of the actual captured scene. Remember that I mentioned we could also select a cube map in HDRI instead for our ambient lighting there. And then this down here, despite the fact that it's plopped there on the floor, this is a sun set to movable as well. So there's no baking going on here. And of course, with the directional light, the position of it doesn't matter. All that matters is the rotation as well as the other light settings, such as intensity and color and things like that. You'll also notice that we have a few different sphere reflection captures right here. And you'll notice that there's some value in having sphere reflection captures right next to the object that they're reflecting from. And you'll learn more about why that's true as we get to the section on reflections. And there we have it. It's a pretty good looking simple scene. There's that box reflection capture I mentioned earlier. Sky atmosphere also connected to the sun. And if we had the HDRI map off, we can see that the sky is actually using the time of day as indicated here by the directional light, which is a little different from the SunSky Blueprint, which we will also be looking at in the project. We can also take a look at the post-process volume. Note that it is set to infinite extent unbound, which tells us it's affecting the entire scene. And as we scroll through here, we can see some of the settings that are starting to be overridden and adjusted. Now, of course, because today's course is focused on lighting, one very useful viewport visualization we have at our disposal is the one called Lighting Only. And this allows us to focus entirely on the lighting without worrying about all those pesky textures that are coming with materials, except, of course, for textures that are outside of those main slots like albedo or base color. And in fact, if we do detail lighting, that also adds reflections into the mix and a couple other maps. You'll notice that roughness maps and specular maps also appear with detail lighting. So that's a nice debug tool when you're working entirely on lighting. A couple other things worth mentioning at this stage. G, our G key, can turn off all our gizmos if we don't want to be distracted by them and just move around our viewport here. We can also hit F11 to go full screen and get much closer to what a final interactive version of the scene might feel in the final scene. And we can also use the F11 to get a little bit more of a sense of what a final interactive version of the scene might feel and look like. And I can, of course, turn those back on by hitting those keys again. And then finally, you might notice I have my FPS displayed up here and smaller icons here, all in the name of maximizing my screen real estate. Those are both taken care of over in editor preferences. And if I type in small, you'll see a setting for small toolbar icons. So I have that checked. And then to see our FPS there, if I just want to keep an eye on my frame rate, I can type in frame rate and hit that checkbox for show frame rate and memory. And yes, of course, we can also see our frame rate here, also with Control-Shift-H. But I do find that a little bit distracting inside my viewport, so I do prefer to keep it up there, even though there is something kind of helpful about the color coding here, green, of course, being a high frame rate, yellow being suboptimal, and red meaning, hey, we've got a problem here. Let's try to solve this. OK. And in the next video, we are going to open up our lighting start level and begin building the lighting in our scene to the point where it starts to look like this. See you there. Thanks for watching.",
