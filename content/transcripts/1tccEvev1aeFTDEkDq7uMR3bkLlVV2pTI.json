  "text": " And in our final section, let's talk about publishing and how we actually distribute our games. Once we've spent all the time building and cooking and putting all the hard work into the projects, how do we actually get our games published? So the Unreal Engine EULA is that you can use it for free when you monetize and ship your game. There is a 5% royalty, but the good thing about the 5% royalty is that it's waived on the first 1 million. So you wouldn't pay the 5% royalties until you started earning over a million dollars. There's no upfront costs or subscription fees, seat licenses. It's just you can download Unreal Engine today and start using it. Everyone has access to the same features. You can get all the source code for Unreal Engine, and it does include all the platforms. A note about the platforms is that you would have to reach out to the individual platform holders to get access to the source code to build for those platforms. But once you're a registered developer on a certain platform, you can then get that platform access included, and it will work the same way as everything else does. So it's really a user-friendly way of using Unreal Engine to deploy your games. Of course, I've linked the Unreal Engine documentation for the EULA if you want to read through that yourself. It's definitely worth looking through because you don't want any nasty surprises when shipping your games. Now, the reason why I included this slide here, you don't need to click on the article. You could do if you want to look at it, but it's more just a reference to history of using Unreal Engine. And when Unreal Engine 4 first came out in 2014, the phrase, we succeed when you succeed, was really apparent then in 2024 and still ongoing over 10 years later. And at the time, Epic was giving away $5 million to devs using Unreal Engine 4, which since then, the budget for that has blown well past that. They've given away so many mega grants and financial support to developers using Unreal Engine. It's still that same ethos through to Unreal Engine 5 and onwards that we succeed when you succeed. And it's just really nice to see the history of that. So the article might be worth a read, but it's more from a philosophical perspective. I just thought that was nice to include. Something I really, really just want to instill in everyone here, which is why I've used a different font color. I've used underline. I've used bold. I've used italics. I've tried to use every tool on my PowerPoint slide formatting repository to just really highlight the fact that you need to complete the form before you release your game. So click on the URL, let Epic know that you're releasing your game. You can do it through the developer portal as well on the Unreal Engine store, but you just need to make sure you let Epic know that you're releasing the game, because that's how when we talk about the royalties and above $1 million and you need to report your sales. It's not a tough or onerous process, but it's just an important step on releasing a commercial project. If you are distributing on the Epic Games Store, which I would personally recommend everyone does, the self publishing tools are available to anyone. Again, a nice URL at the bottom here for you to find that information. And the great thing about the Epic Games Store is that there's an 88-12 revenue split. So 88% in favor of the developer, 12% to Epic, which really makes it a commercially viable option. It's a really good balance of revenue split based on other industry metrics. So, you know, there'd be no reason, in my opinion, not to do that. So definitely check out distributing your games on the Epic Games Store if that's something you want to do on PC.",
