00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720
Next up, let's go over the primary nodes and textures you'll be using in your projects.

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.840
So we'll talk about the primary PBR inputs here, the base color or Albedo maps, metallic

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.520
roughness and specular, and also talk about the textures, what Unreal supports and what

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.440
the kind of best workflow is for using textures inside of Unreal.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.640
We'll talk about texture pyramids or MIP maps as they're referred to, and then import in

6
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.840
your textures how to get your content into Unreal.

7
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.640
So the primary PBR inputs are the base color, and we'll go through creating a material

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.880
at the end, so you don't need to worry specifically if you're unfamiliar with this interface,

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.440
but essentially we've got a base color going in, which is just this blue color, and then

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.240
we can set some metallic specular or roughness values depending on how we want this material

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240
to look.

12
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.960
So this is all handled on the editor side.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.040
So the base color or Albedo map, as we refer to it, is a flat color without specularity

14
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.140
or shading.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.360
So roughness is key to define the look of a material, and it's selling the real world

16
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
equivalent.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880
So the Albedo map is a linear RGB, which is a vector 3, which is actually what we saw

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
in that previous slide.

19
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.600
So this is a vector 3, so it has three numerical values.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.200
So that's a vector 3 going in there, and the values between 0 and 1.

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.120
So we want to avoid any pure black in Albedo, and we want to avoid any pure white, as they

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.800
don't really exist in nature.

23
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.720
So to get the metallic feel, essentially metallic is a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to

24
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
1, and really it's either 1 or 0.

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.160
It's either on or off.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.960
You don't really use any mid-grounds here, but when on, which is number 1, it yields

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.840
100% specular reflection.

28
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:55.000
So you can see the sliding scale of 0 to 1 there, 1 being the most specular and 0 being

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.880
the most absorbent of the reflection.

30
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.760
And then the roughness map is a grayscale value again that ranges from 0 to 1, but the

31
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.040
ranges from smooth is like a mirror-like surface, which is 0, which you can see on the left

32
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.200
here, to a rougher matte surface, which is on the right side there.

33
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.880
So unlike with metallic, this really can be dialed into whatever value you'd like.

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.020
As long as that value is between 0 and 1, you can say 0.35, for example, and really

35
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.360
dial in that roughness for whatever you're trying to achieve there.

36
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.360
So specular then is a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1, and it's a good rule of

37
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.080
thumb is to set the specular value to 0.5 and fine-tune it from the roughness value

38
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080
instead.

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960
Have it on by default and set it to 0.5 so no node connection is needed for it.

40
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.360
And in some cases, you may decide to edit the roughness value or use a bitmap to that

41
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
effect.

42
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.920
So you can achieve this by using stylized looks over the top of glossiness.

43
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.440
It's not always needed when using a roughness value, but it's worth considering the specularity

44
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.040
in balance with the other inputs of your material there.

45
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And so Unreal Engine supported formats.

46
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In an uncompressed file format, Unreal does support BMPs, Targets, PSDs.

47
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's worth noting that depending on the export of the Targets, if you're setting a 32-bit

48
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.040
there, you can get an alpha out of that Targets.

49
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.680
And then compressed versions, you can have a PNG, JPEG, DDS, and HDR.

50
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.720
For optimization purposes, it's best to work with PNG due to its lightweight file size

51
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
and the ability to have transparency info when needed.

52
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.160
But it's worth considering the different formats depending on the project's requirements there.

53
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.740
And so when looking at guidelines, textures should always be a power of 2.

54
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.040
So when we import our textures, maybe it's 16 by 16 or 8192 by 8192, and any variation,

55
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.360
you know, 64 by 64, et cetera.

56
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.680
But the textures don't have to be square.

57
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.400
It's mainly that they're a power of 2 that's the important point.

58
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.520
So if you wanted 16 by 128, that's fine.

59
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.720
So they're all acceptable examples as long as they're power of 2.

60
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.600
And textures can affect the streaming and memory management.

61
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.760
So it's important to keep this in mind, especially on that previous slide where we were talking

62
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.800
about the different file formats.

63
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.120
Making sure you're considering the memory management of what the project's output is.

64
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.160
That's super useful, especially at the start of the project when trying to define your

65
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160
pipeline there.

66
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.360
And high frequency textures can cause anti-aliasing and artifacts.

67
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.080
So a couple of examples of the different import settings used for maybe streamed or non-streamed

68
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.240
textures and also how to scale the number of mipmaps, for example.

69
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.960
So whether you have alpha channels or not, the size of the textures, the method that

70
00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.920
they're imported at, they can all be dialed in for the project's requirements essentially.

71
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And on the texture pyramid side, which is the mipmaps, mipmaps are another custom setting.

72
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.200
So we can set these, when you use the textures inside the material editor, you can see that

73
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.640
you can set these values on the material editor in the expression sample.

74
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.160
And then you can also double click any textures and set the texture group from here as well.

75
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.640
So useful to keep in mind when working with texture pyramids.

76
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.600
And then when you're importing your textures, so you can see from the previous slide, we

77
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.080
have this drop down here.

78
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.840
That's what we're referring to on the mipmap side.

79
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.520
But then also when we import the textures, you can either use the import button in the

80
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.520
content browser or you can go to file, import, or you can simply just drag and drop the file

81
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.000
from the Windows Explorer into the content browser and that will import it just fine.

82
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.760
All textures are converted to UAssets.

83
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.960
So when we're looking at Unreal file formats, even if it was a PNG that you're importing,

84
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.480
the PNG then gets turned into a UAsset on the import.

85
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.720
You can open a texture using this texture editor that you can see on the right hand

86
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.600
side here with a double click of that texture that you've just imported.

87
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.640
And so here we can change any compression settings, anything we need to.

88
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.120
There's a lot of just scalability optionality here that you can dial in for your relevant

89
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.920
projects and you can even import at higher resolution and downscale it inside the engine

90
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920
if you need to.

91
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.600
So we can also enable or disable linear color space here, which is the sRGB as well.

92
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.400
So all these things hopefully useful to keep in mind when starting your projects.
