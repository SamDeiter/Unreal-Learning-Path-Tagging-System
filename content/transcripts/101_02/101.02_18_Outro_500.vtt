00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So we've covered a lot of ground today.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.520
We've set up materials inside of Unreal.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.400
We've gone through the PBR pipeline and explained how to import content into the editor and

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.360
talked about adding existing content from different sources.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.440
And then we've really deep dived into the material editor showing you just a Vector3

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.340
color material setup all the way into creating just this big pair of material that can house

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.220
Albedo maps and specular maps, normal maps, etc.

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.980
As well as then having control over the UV functionality and even creating basic conditional

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.940
statements using the switcher.

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.840
And then we showed you a quick emissive tip as well.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.380
So a lot of ground covered.

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.860
Hopefully it was all useful and interesting and we'll see you on the next course.
