00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
So to go over the real time material concepts, what are materials in Unreal?

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160
What is PBR?

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.760
Especially if I mention PBR in that intro and you're like, what's PBR?

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.960
Well we'll go over that and we'll talk about Fresnel effects and also the view modes inside

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.560
of Unreal that you'd expect to see.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.080
So what is a material?

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.680
So a material is essentially an applied asset to a mesh that controls its visual look essentially.

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000
So in its simplest form, think of it as paint within the various properties such as the

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.120
colour and the finish.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.480
So a material defines how the light interacts with the surface it is applied to.

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.360
So you can see on these example materials here, if it's something very porous and seems

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.800
to absorb the light, the material can actually set the parameters of how that should look

13
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.800
As well as if it's more of a reflective metallic surface and you want the light to bounce off

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.560
it instead of get absorbed, the material can define that inside of Unreal.

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.020
The PBR pipeline is a unified lighting and shading system essentially.

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.240
So it's physically based rendering is what PBR stands for and it's a better approximation

17
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.560
of the light and material physical interaction.

18
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.840
So it's very intuitive and consistent.

19
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840
It's physically accurate.

20
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.680
It uses real world physical measurements and a PBR is a combination of the material, which

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.720
we spoke about in the previous slide, lighting setups inside of Unreal Engine and then also

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.360
the exposure that you use in.

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.280
And then Fresnel effect.

24
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.940
So the Fresnel effect states that the amount of light you see reflected from a surface

25
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.320
depends on the viewing angle in which you perceive the surface.

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.600
So you can see if you're dead on, 2 to 5% reflection there and on the 90 degree angle,

27
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.040
you've got 100% reflection.

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.520
So it creates this nice kind of outlining effect, the Fresnel effect that you see on

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520
the material there.

30
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.060
And the unified shading model within Unreal Engine handles this for us.

31
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.960
So you don't have to do anything custom there.

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.320
Unreal Engine's shading model just handles that for you.

33
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.900
And then the different view modes that we can touch upon inside of Unreal.

34
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.900
You can go to the view mode, the view part, sorry, in the middle window and you can select

35
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.500
lit from your editor scene and you can select between a few different things.

36
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.040
There's some optimization and things like this, but the ones that we care about are

37
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040
along the top here.

38
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.300
So lit, you can see everything within the scene.

39
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.860
Unlit will just show the colors and the textures.

40
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.200
So that might be useful for just previewing if you don't want any lighting information

41
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.240
to be seen.

42
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.280
You could have light ink only, which also just shows the lighting of what you have in

43
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280
your scene.

44
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.820
And then you can have a detail lighting, which is light and reflections there.

45
00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.600
So it might be useful to play around with some of these lighting only or detail lighting.

46
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.760
And you can also toggle through these using alt plus, you know, other different relevant

47
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.840
numbers if you're previewing that content a lot.
