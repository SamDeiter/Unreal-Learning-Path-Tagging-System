00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
So the material that we set up is great for if you just want a basic color implementation,

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.460
but what if you want to add textures to your material?

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.240
So for this we can use placeholders.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.320
So we can actually expose texture parameters such as the albedo maps, normal maps we need

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.960
to account for in the parent material and use placeholders in place of that and then

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.500
you can apply your own textures on the actual instance.

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.160
So these could be any textures in your system, but we're going to include some neutral textures

8
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.300
which is the white square texture, a black texture and also the T normal texture.

9
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.800
So we'll jump into the editor now and get that set up.
