00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
Next, let's touch upon the material system and the parents and instances that encompass

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920
that.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.480
So, the topics here are the material editor, parent materials, and material instances.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.000
And so, the material editor is an intuitive node-based editor.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.360
We can create HLSL shaders without any need for any kind of coding.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.360
It's all represented through the visual node graph that you can see on the right hand side

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360
here.

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.760
We can organize the material graph with comments and descriptions and make it very clean and

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.320
easy to read and you can kind of pick apart the flow and understand exactly what's going

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.960
on in material editors, which again, like I mentioned at the start, we'll touch upon

11
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
towards the end in the material editor section.

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
So when we're talking about material, a parent material, a parent material is an asset that

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.720
you end up with when you save the node tree from the material editor.

14
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.840
So the image that we saw on the previous slide, if we saved that, that would become a parent

15
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
material.

16
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.680
And you typically adjust a parent material to behave based on a series of criteria and

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.800
properties you define such as input options for whether it be base color, which is the

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.400
albedo, metallic, roughness, normal, you know, et cetera.

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640
Any of those inputs would list it above.

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.160
So even though you can apply a parent material directly to an object, you can usually create

21
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.040
an instance derived from it that you apply instead on the scene.

22
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.960
So the parent material houses all the instructions and the instance can then be a more optimized

23
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.680
way of using that because parent materials are essentially heavier to use.

24
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800
They require recompiling every time you change them.

25
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.360
Whereas an instance, you can edit on the fly and you can change different parameters

26
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.280
and you don't have to recompile the entire shader because the shader already knows what

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
it needs to do.

28
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.520
The main thing to take away though is to adopt a naming convention when naming your parent

29
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.640
material so you understand in the editor, you know, whether you want to use M underscore

30
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.880
for material or mat.

31
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.560
Some people use mat underscore.

32
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.920
Just whatever name and convention you think of, keep it consistent so that everyone can

33
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.440
understand the difference between a material and a material instance.

34
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.960
Unreal does have a way of filtering these things out, but it's sometimes just easier

35
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960
to see from the naming convention what this material type is.

36
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.040
And so giving you some hot keys for your material editor, maybe you want to take a screenshot

37
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.840
of this or note them down.

38
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.240
There's some useful node shortcuts here to take away.

39
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.720
It will create them, especially if you're using the material editor a lot.

40
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.080
These kind of things will save a lot of time.

41
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.840
And then talking about material instances, instance materials inherit the properties

42
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800
of a parent material they are based upon.

43
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.920
So you can set the parent material in such a way to have total control over the parameters

44
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.600
and expose them in the instance.

45
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.280
And we'll talk about what this looks like at the end of the course when we actually

46
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.680
create our own material instance, but it essentially means that you can have any number of material

47
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.000
instances based on a single parent and have totally different looks and finishes.

48
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.400
So it really helps you dial in the different values that you want using the instance instead

49
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.880
of that parent material.

50
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.560
So material instances, as mentioned, are much lighter to work with and can change at playtime

51
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.960
without the need to recompile the parent material.

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.280
And a material instance UI is simpler to use.

53
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.560
It's just a much more streamlined set of commands that you can use over the node-based material

54
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560
editor.

55
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.680
As mentioned previously, you just want to make sure that naming convention is set when

56
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.140
you're using material instances.

57
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.440
So we use MI for material instances.

58
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.240
So M underscore for material and MI underscore for a material instance really just helps

59
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.280
people, well yourself as well, but people on the project understand what the different

60
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.560
materials material types are and how to use them without having to hover over to find

61
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.600
the information or double click it to open it up.

62
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.760
It's just a much more streamlined way of working.
