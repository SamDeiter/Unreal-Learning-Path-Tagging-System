00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A really nice customization as well of these materials is to actually sort the parameters

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
and keep things organized into parameter groups.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.300
So we can control the order in which information is displayed.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.940
So instead of a generic expandable rollout, we can create a specific group for the various

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.480
defined parameters and sort it any way you see fit.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.320
So we can select a node and add it to a group, which we'll do in the editor right now, and

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.120
set the sorting parameter and groups are sorted alphabetically.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.840
So you can force them into a particular order by adding a numerical value.

9
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.320
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.280
And let's sort our albedo, metallic, roughness, and normal into their own groups here.

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.840
So back in our editor here, we will first do the albedo texture sorting group.

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.400
We can just type in one albedo and do sort priority as one here.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.840
And then maybe let's do tint color.

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.840
We use a drop down and now we can select albedo because we had it typed in before.

15
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.960
Now let's do two there.

16
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.760
And then we'll do the same for metallic.

17
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.440
So we'll type in two dash metallic.

18
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:29.080
We'll do three dash roughness.

19
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.300
You can probably guess where we're going with the normal.

20
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.760
So four dash normal.

21
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.460
Save this.

22
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.260
And then we can see our groups here and we can see the tint colors below the texture

23
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.020
because we did the sort priority.

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.380
I didn't set any sort priorities for these other properties here, but you can obviously

25
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.980
do so depending on the complexity of your material there.

26
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.820
So really nice way to keep things organized and categorized.
