00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
If you want control over your UVs, you can actually control this through the material

2
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680
editor as well.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.920
So we can add a text quad using the U shortcut and you can drag and drop the text quad in

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.140
there, maybe set the UV tile into one and one.

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.340
And then we can also multiply that text quad to get some UV scaling going on.

6
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.780
And that will expose that parameter, which gives you a lot of functionality and control

7
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.980
over the UV.

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.620
And we can even add a custom rotator as well.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.180
So again, custom rotator node is here and then we can divide that by whatever numerical

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.100
value, maybe it's 360 and then use UV rotate as one there to add a custom rotator.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.820
So let's jump into the editor.

12
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.140
Let's get that set up.

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.500
Again, we're getting some more advanced functionality now over the material editor.

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.020
So in our material editor, we want the texture coordinate and maybe you want it on the albedo

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.340
texture for example.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280
So let's add a text quad.

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.040
We can do this holding U and left clicking.

18
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.140
So that's our texture coordinate.

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.420
We also want to multiply this texture coordinate, just making sure the UV tile is one and one.

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.460
Scroll down M to multiply.

21
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.460
So we'll multiply this and then we'll add a one and left click for a constant, convert

22
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.020
this to a parameter and let's go for UV scale on this one.

23
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.940
So UV scale, I'll set the default value to one on the UV scale.

24
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.820
There we go.

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.760
And then let's multiply this into the custom rotator.

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.700
We could add this directly in if we only just wanted to use the UV scale, but let's get

27
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.860
the custom rotator in here as well.

28
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.200
Let's do custom, custom rotator.

29
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.380
So we want to plug the UVs into here like that.

30
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.900
The rotated value that can then go into the UV there.

31
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.580
And now let's add the UV rotate.

32
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.380
So we'll hold down one and left click and convert to a parameter.

33
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.020
Again you start finding you're doing the same process over and over again, which is good

34
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.540
habit to get into.

35
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.320
So UV rotate, we'll do a one there and then we will divide this.

36
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.700
So we will divide and we'll make sure coordinate B is 360.

37
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.380
So divide that by 360 and then rotation can go into the rotation angle.

38
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.460
So now we can have control over the UVs, the scaling of the UVs.

39
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.020
If you want to give the grouping to these texture coordinates, you can.

40
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.620
So the UV scale and that I think would be four.

41
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.420
Yeah, that would be four.

42
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.860
And then we want to do rotate as well.

43
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.140
So that could be five.

44
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.940
So you can see things getting organized here, which is really nice.

45
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.460
Nice way to add some UV control over your albedo texture.

46
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.300
And of course you can do this for other textures.

47
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.540
You could drag it out into multiple outputs and copy that setup.

48
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.940
However you would like to then start authoring these materials.

49
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.380
So the first thing we want to do now and now that we got our material set up is to

50
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.700
actually give it a test drive and let's see how it's looking.

51
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.500
So let's go into our scene.

52
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.100
You can have any basic geometry.

53
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.100
You don't have to have this scene.

54
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.580
You could just have a cube if you wanted to from the shapes palette.

55
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.780
It can be anything you would like.

56
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.140
I'm just going to maybe scale it up as well.

57
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.420
So I'll create, I'll get the material instance and I will apply this to the mesh.

58
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.860
I can either plug it in here under the material or I can drag and drop it as well, whichever

59
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.740
one you'd prefer to, whichever approach you prefer to take.

60
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:27.420
And let's make sure we have our UV scale turned on and let's try and find some kind of rock

61
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.540
or some other type of texture.

62
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.340
Doesn't matter what texture it is, but just make sure you have some kind of texture going

63
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.340
on here.

64
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.340
I'm going to change this tint color here just to make sure that it's easier to see on the

65
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.220
screen.

66
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.740
Maybe I'll look at this here.

67
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.820
So we've got some kind of rock going on here.

68
00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.860
Let's make sure this gets saved and updated.

69
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.140
Let's make sure we're in the lit mode as well.

70
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.900
So if you turned off the lighting previously, make sure you're in lit mode.

71
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.260
And now let's play around with some of these scale values.

72
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.340
So I'm just going to bring this into some kind of real estate that you can see.

73
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.980
So first of all, we've got the UV scale.

74
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.540
Again, I'm just trying to organize my window so you can see a little bit.

75
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.780
So let's scale it by two.

76
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.500
You can see it's scaling by two.

77
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.820
If I want it to repeat less, you can have a scale of 0.1.

78
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.020
And you can just keep scaling and scaling.

79
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.300
I think the larger you scale, you start to see the repeating patterns.

80
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.620
But you get the idea of the scale working.

81
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.020
And then UV rotate.

82
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.300
If you, I mean, we can see this happening in real time.

83
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.780
But if you want to type whatever values in, you can see that rotating.

84
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.500
So we know that our properties are working, which means we're in a really good place.

85
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.500
Maybe I want to save these values.

86
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.900
I'm not sure.

87
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.100
But I think the last thing I want to do is because we're going to be plugging normal

88
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.980
maps in and because we're going to be using certain textures, let's actually jump back

89
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.980
into the material.

90
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.980
And let's actually say this isn't just for the Albedo.

91
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.500
Let's say I'm going to drag the comments in here.

92
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:27.140
And I'm just going to drag down here and say hit comment and say, let's say, text texture

93
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.540
coordinate, something like that.

94
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.980
You can call it whatever you'd like.

95
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.300
But essentially what we want to do, maybe just add a bit of alpha just whilst we're

96
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.500
here or remove a bit of alpha.

97
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.820
But I think we want to do this for all the UVs because we're going to be using normal

98
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.740
maps and especially different texture maps.

99
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.340
You probably want to be, if you're scaling one, you probably more often than not want

100
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.380
to be doing all of them uniformly.

101
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.540
Now, if for whatever reason you don't, you can obviously just copy and paste that information.

102
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.820
But I think I'm going to plug that into all four in this instance.

103
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.100
And if I am doing that, I'm going to remove the group.

104
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:17.620
Well, maybe not remove the group, maybe add a five and text co-ord, something like that.

105
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.580
You can call the group whatever you'd like.

106
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.460
So I'll call, I'll set the priority of two for that.

107
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.380
And then I'll set the priority of one for this one.

108
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.060
And I'll save it.

109
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.420
And now in our material instance, we should be able to see these texture coordinate values

110
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.500
now here.

111
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.980
And again, we can scale it.

112
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.560
And this will mean that the normal map is scaling and the roughness maps or whatever

113
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.380
maps we're using, they're all being scaled uniformly, which I think is the desired result

114
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.920
that we'd want in this instance.

115
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.200
So yeah, hopefully that shows you a really nice power of the material editor and just

116
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.040
add in the customizable functionality of whatever you would like.

117
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.520
Again, how to save the materials, making sure you're consistently saving.

118
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.880
Just all these elements will help build out your material libraries.
