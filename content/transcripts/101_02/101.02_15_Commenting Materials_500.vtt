00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680
And then possibly one of the most satisfying things you can do in the material editor is

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.380
to get things organized by adding comments.

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.160
So I come from a very blueprint driven background in Unreal so it's very nice that the material

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.840
editor now has this functionality to comment and give things descriptions and comment colors.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.680
And so we can add a comment by pressing C. So let's jump into the editor again and let's

6
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.120
just get everything cleaned up here.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.440
So we will drag let's say the base color into some different real estate and let's hit C

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.320
on our keyboard and let's type base color, well let's call this albedo, it makes sense

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.080
albedo.

10
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.040
And you'll see by default we get a little comment box above.

11
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.640
I generally don't like the comment box above there but you can keep it if you want.

12
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.960
Just sorry I got rid of that.

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.400
So when we select the comment color we want to go to maybe say TLE or turquoisey kind

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
of color.

15
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.240
I generally like dropping the alpha down to maybe a 0.4 or something like that, it just

16
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.840
gives it a little bit of a softer feel, kind of nice.

17
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.640
So we'll go to font size, if you have a big material graph maybe you have size 40 on like

18
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.480
some kind of key information up here but then maybe you don't need as much for say metallic

19
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.040
there, maybe it's even a 12 instead.

20
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:47.680
Maybe metallic is a darker color again maybe dropping that alpha down just to soften it.

21
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.000
You can also copy and paste these so I'm just going to select metallic, copy and let's go

22
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.640
roughness, let's maybe change this to a different color, you can just drag and drop that in

23
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.760
and as soon as you drag and drop it in then it moves it around which is really nice.

24
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.840
And then let's do normal and I think normal has to be blue probably, well a bluish purple.

25
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
Deep blue.

26
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.440
Again you could spend a lot of time trying to clean this stuff up but that's good for

27
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.760
now, it just shows you how to keep things organized, you can of course go out to town

28
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.760
on this kind of thing and yeah if you want to do anything like that you can.

29
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.680
The only last thing I like to do is double click on any of these wires and you can kind

30
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.360
of add these re-root nodes that you can also move around with your keyboard as well.

31
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.960
So you just double click on the wire and it just creates a nice satisfying flow of information

32
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.080
if you so wish, in case you've got any like tangling of wires and just keeping things

33
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.440
nice and organized I just like to double click, create re-root nodes and like I said move

34
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.960
them around on your keyboard or do that.

35
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.200
It just you know especially if you bring information out here just keep things nice and clean and

36
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.720
organized so good way to keep things tidy in your material editor.
