00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on materials which is an introduction

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.760
for AEC.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120
So let's talk about the introduction.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.220
Let's go over the topics that we'll be covering today.

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.400
So we'll be talking about real-time material concepts which is the PBR pipeline.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320
We'll be talking about the primary nodes and textures, so PBR inputs and texture guidelines.

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.000
We'll be going over the material system and talking about how parent materials and instances

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.760
of those materials works.

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.440
We've got ready-made materials and textures, so we'll go over where you can find starter

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.680
packs and marketplace assets and the Quixel Megascans library.

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.820
And then we'll go into authoring your own materials.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.080
So we'll talk about the material editor.

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.920
We'll create a parent material and then we'll create an instance from that and show the

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.520
power of the material instance in.
