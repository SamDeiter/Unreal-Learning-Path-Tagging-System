00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
So, stepping our materials up a little bit more, we can actually have parameter switches

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.240
to our materials as well.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.080
So we can essentially get an either or scenario with a branch.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
We can set the switch to choose between two different directions and whether to use maybe

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.000
this texture map or whether we use the base color and we can set a static switch to say

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
true or false.

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.480
We'll do a switch called use albedo texture question mark and if true we'll use albedo,

8
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.320
if false we'll use a base color.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.520
So let's jump into the editor and do that and get that hooked in now.

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.200
So we'll find some empty space up here, we'll drag these to the side, we'll right click

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:01:00.560
add a switch parameter, so right click, switch parameter and we'll say use albedo texture

12
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.760
question mark and you'll see that you can also, if you didn't click the description

13
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.480
you can change it on the parameter name down here if you prefer.

14
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.980
I just type everything directly into the box there.

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.500
So you can also just select and then select again, not double click but select and select

16
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.860
again to edit the text.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
So use albedo texture, if true well we want to come from the albedo texture so that makes

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.700
sense and if not we want to use a base color.

19
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.340
So I'm going to hold down three, left click, I'm going to right click on the node, I'm

20
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.300
going to convert to a parameter, I'm going to call this base color and then go into false

21
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.220
and let's just set a base color whilst we're here of maybe an off, just off white kind

22
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.380
of color just to make sure there's something there and then we can go directly into the

23
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
base color.

24
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.300
So now what we'll have is we'll have a parameter switch, if I save the material we've also

25
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.780
got a base color and a switch.

26
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.380
So when we go into our material instance now we'll actually see that we've got use albedo

27
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.820
texture and use base color.

28
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.620
Now the only two things I really want to change here which is technically one thing but let's

29
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.660
get this categorized back into our parameter group because it just looks way cleaner.

30
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.740
So let's jump back in here, we've still got our parameter group set up there so I'll use

31
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.320
parameter group.

32
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.740
So no parameter group for that one but we can definitely get a parameter group in with

33
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.140
So let's say albedo and we can sort that as number three which is underneath tint color

34
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.860
and then we can save it and therefore now we've got the static switch, use albedo texture,

35
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.060
we've got a base color there if we want to set a base color and whether we set the switch

36
00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.280
to true or false gives us the optionality which is really really nice so it's like okay

37
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.000
you want to use this, that's base color, use albedo texture true, well now we can see the

38
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.440
other properties so not only does it categorize things it also tells you what options are

39
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.000
currently being used which is such a powerful feature of the material editor and really

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.600
really nice quality of life thing.
