00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
Now the last thing we'd like to cover before we close out today is creating emissive materials.

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.740
And essentially emissive material can help with the global illumination of the scene

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.740
as well.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.880
So we still start with a basic material and we just change the shading model to unlit.

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.540
The unlit shader model uses fewer instructions than a default lit model and is often enough

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.140
to define an emissive material.

7
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.420
So we just want to multiply a color node and a constants mode which essentially gives us

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
the intensity.

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.660
Convert them both to parameters, create a material instance and then we'll test out

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.660
the material.

11
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.460
So that's the last kind of workshop for the day.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.340
Let's jump into the editor again and let's set this up before we close out.

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.820
So back in our materials folder, I'm going to right click, I'm going to go to material,

14
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.780
I'm going to call this M underscore emissive and hit enter.

15
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.620
Enter again to open it up.

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.060
Now the thing that we do here differently than what you've done previously is without

17
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.100
anything selected, you want to go to the shading model on the left hand side, go to default

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.820
unlit.

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.420
That will take off certain values here.

20
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.340
So we want three nodes here.

21
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.860
We want a vector three which hold down three on your keyboard.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740
We want a constants one just to multiply this.

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460
So hold down one and then we also want a multiply.

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.060
So hold down M on your keyboard for multiply.

25
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.220
So three and left click, one on left click, M for multiply and left click.

26
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.460
Let's drag these into here.

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.580
Let's create this basic setup straight into the emissive color.

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.460
Now I'm going to convert this to a parameter and call this emissive color.

29
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.500
I'm going to right click, convert to a parameter and call this intensity.

30
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.500
I'll set the intensity to one by default and then I'll just create some kind of color

31
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.020
just as our nice emissive color.

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.140
Hit okay.

33
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.580
Now let's just save this.

34
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.460
Now we'll create an instance of this just because good workflow will keep maintaining

35
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.140
what we've previously spoken about.

36
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.740
So even though it's a quick example, we'll create a material instance.

37
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.900
I'm just going to call this mi underscore emissive.

38
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.660
Let's just call this, I might even just call this pink instead.

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.740
You might call it 01, you might call it pink, whatever you'd like to call it.

40
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.620
And we just want to make sure these are all ticked.

41
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.300
Let's see what's happening here.

42
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.540
So let's go inside.

43
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.860
Let's go to our shapes panel.

44
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.380
Let's drag in a sphere here.

45
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.780
Let's scale it into position.

46
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.620
Let's drag and drop this emissive.

47
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.140
And you'll see we're getting some illumination bounce.

48
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.340
And that's a really nice feature of Unreal Engine 5 with the lighting system.

49
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.260
So we're getting some bounce off the emissive here.

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.100
So we might want to change this intensity to maybe make it a ball of light,

51
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.940
like a sunlight or something like this.

52
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.420
And you'll see that we instantly start getting this flood and this fill of color in the scene.

53
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.540
So I'm just going to create a bit more real estate here just so you can see what's happening.

54
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.780
So again, because it's a material instance, we can change this at runtime.

55
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.460
So if you wanted to change this in your scene at runtime, you could do so.

56
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.660
Green is not the nicest color, but we'll go with it for now.

57
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.860
But you can see scaling the intensity, really nice power over the scene or control over the scene,

58
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.700
depending on what you like.

59
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.540
And just using on the emissive materials,

60
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.700
really nice way to just add a bit of flavor to your scene.

61
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.860
So hopefully that's a useful little tip for creating unlit emissive materials.
