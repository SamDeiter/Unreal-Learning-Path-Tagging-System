00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So just to give you a quick example of those view modes,

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.200
when we're inside of Unreal,

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.120
so you can see by default we've opened in lit mode.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.320
So we can see we've got shadowing going on,

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560
we've got the global illumination system working.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.360
So we're in lit mode right now.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.840
So let's go to unlit and see that.

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.560
So because there's no other materials on these walls,

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.400
it's very hard to see any definition

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.480
because a lot of the definition

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.920
was being caused by the lighting.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.120
But if I pan around, you can see the different material

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.080
that might be being used

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.320
and essentially it's color and textures only.

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.500
And then we could see lighting only for example.

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.400
So we can only see lighting information.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.600
So now we can't see any of the coloring on the textures,

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.280
but we can see the shadowing that's happening

19
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.640
with the lighting and we might just care about

20
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
how the light is impacting the scene.

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.960
And then we could also go to detail lighting

22
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.720
just to see that extra view mode there.

23
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.120
So again, there's a lot of view modes to play with

24
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.560
depending on the work that you're currently doing.

25
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.600
You might find some more useful than others,

26
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.400
but that's just to give you a quick explanation

27
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
of what's happening inside of Unreal.
