00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
So we'll go back to our master material.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.240
We will find some empty space here.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.880
We will hold down M and left click and have it for multiply.

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260
Again these are from the hotkeys that we set at the start but you can just right click

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.640
in the menu as well and type multiply and find it there.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.560
But we want to use shortcuts wherever we can.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.800
We want to hold down 3 on the keyboard and left click to create a vector 3.

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.240
We want to convert this to a parameter.

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.120
Call this tint.

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.360
If I can spell color.

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.760
I'm going to plug this node into here.

12
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.600
Plug this node into here.

13
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.360
Because it's multiplying it doesn't really matter which way around it goes.

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.040
I'm just going to plug it around into there.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720
And then tint color.

16
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.680
Let's just have a default value of like a bluish type of color just to make sure that

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.600
it's got some kind of nice default value and then we'll save that.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.360
And so now because we've saved it and because it's a vector 3 parameter we can actually

19
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.920
hop back into our material instance and you'll see that we've got a nice tint color here

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
which we can then do whatever we want with.

21
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.240
So slowly we're just layering in the complexity of the materials and adding nice subtleties

22
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.000
and a nice customization for use in our worlds.
