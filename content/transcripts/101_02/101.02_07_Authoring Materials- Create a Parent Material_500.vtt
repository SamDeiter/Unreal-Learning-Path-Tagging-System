00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
So, as promised, we're going to learn now how to create a parent material.

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.680
And to give you a bit of an overview of how I'm going to do this, again, I'll talk you

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.960
step by step through the editor if you're unsure of the process here.

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.220
But I'm just going to walk through the steps in case you just wanted to know the TLDR version

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.220
of this.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.480
But we want to create an opaque parent material.

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.740
So start simple and move away up.

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.440
We can add constant nodes to primary inputs.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.960
Like we said, we can add the base color, the metallic, the roughness, and just get started

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
from there.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.300
And then we'll add some parameters.

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.620
So we'll add a parameter to our material and we'll make sure that we can adjust the values

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.540
then using a material instance.

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.900
So we can add vector parameters.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.060
We can add names to these parameters and then edit them in the instances after.

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.720
So when I create a material instance, I'll be able to check that those parameters are

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.220
exposed and I can edit them correctly.

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.100
So let's dive into the editor and let's create a material plus a material instance to really

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.300
describe exactly what we're talking about here.
