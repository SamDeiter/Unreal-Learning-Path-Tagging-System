00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
So back in my editor, I'm just going to go to the content folder.

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm going to right click in the empty space here in the lighter gray space.

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.760
I'm just going to create a new folder.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.960
I'm going to call this materials.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
It just keeps things nice and organized and in its own space.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.220
And then I'm going to hit enter with it selected.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.360
And then that just goes to the materials folder.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.400
You can of course just go through the content folder file structure and select materials.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm going to now right click and I'm going to select material.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.520
Now thinking about naming conventions before, I'm going to say m underscore color material

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.480
and I'm going to spell color the British way.

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.480
I'm probably not going to call it material actually because the prefix at the start denotes

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
that it's material.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.640
So I'm just going to call it m underscore color.

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.240
I'm going to hit enter and then enter again and that will load up the material editor.

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.880
Now I'm just going to pin this at the top of the window here.

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.440
And if I go back to the editor, if that didn't open for you, you can just double click it

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
as well.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.960
That also will open it.

20
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm just going to shut this plugins by middle mouse button in on the wheel and that shuts

21
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.680
any windows there.

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.880
You can also just hit there close.

23
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240
You may not even have that plugins open.

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.480
So the first thing I want to do is using our shortcuts before that we showed on the slides,

25
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.840
I'm going to hold the number three on my keyboard and left mouse click and that will create

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
a vector three.

27
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.440
And I'm just going to drag into the base color and then I'm going to hold down wall one,

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.680
the number one on the keyboard, sorry, and left click and put that into metallic.

29
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.680
I'm going to hold down one again, left click and go into roughness.

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.320
So we should have something that looks like this.

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.400
Now first thing I want to do is change this color.

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.920
So I'm going to select the vector three node.

33
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.720
I'm going to click on the color constants here.

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.200
I'm just going to pick a color, whatever you prefer and just hit OK.

35
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.480
And that gives us some kind of color value here.

36
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.720
Now, depending on how we want this material to look, we can set some default values.

37
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.280
I'll set one on the metallic just to give it a metallic look for now.

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.040
We'll be editing this, but that gives it a nice metallic look.

39
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040
Just hit one.

40
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:40.440
Now, if I save this material, that material is good to apply to an actor in any of the

41
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.760
maps that we've got.

42
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.160
However, we want a more streamlined way of working with material instances.

43
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.880
So first thing I'll do here is I will right click.

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.920
I'm going to convert to a parameter.

45
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.720
I'm just going to call this color.

46
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.920
And again, spell color, however you would normally spell color.

47
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400
I'll spell it the British way.

48
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.480
And I'm going to hit save.

49
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.240
And that's going to save the material.

50
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.760
And then I'm going to actually close the material.

51
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.120
Now, what I want to do now is selecting the material, I'm going to right click and create

52
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.960
a material instance.

53
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.360
I'm going to call this MI underscore color.

54
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.040
And I'm going to call this underscore 01 as well.

55
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.560
So I'm going to be creating multiple instances of these.

56
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.320
Now, I'm going to hit enter again to open this.

57
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.440
I'm going to pin my window.

58
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.560
Now, if you notice, if I double click this, now it's a condensed version of that material

59
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560
that we saw.

60
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.880
I'm just holding down right click to zoom in and out.

61
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.160
You can also change how the material looks in the preview there if you so wish.

62
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.120
But you'll see now we have this color parameter, which we can tick and actually change the

63
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.840
color directly.

64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.440
So again, as we were talking about, this is a condensed version of the nodes.

65
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.680
This is a really nice, powerful way to edit the material instance.

66
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.920
Now, what we can also do, you'll see color is here, but none of the other properties

67
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.920
are.

68
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.520
What we can do is we can go back into our content library and we can double click the

69
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.480
color and we can actually right click on these as well to convert them to parameter.

70
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.000
So I'll right click there and type metallic.

71
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.720
I'm going to right click on this, convert to a parameter and call it roughness.

72
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:42.640
And I'm going to save and then I will close the material.

73
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
And now we can see we've got a metallic and roughness value.

74
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.080
So if I want to select these and say, well, I actually want metallic to be zero now, or

75
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.480
I want roughness to be, you know, point four, for example, we can actually do this and start

76
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.120
creating materials that we want.

77
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.840
Now, if I save and close, I can actually duplicate this and it'll call it 02.

78
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.600
I can duplicate it again and call it 03.

79
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.400
And now we have really powerful functionality going on.

80
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.920
We can have metallic surfaces with more roughness.

81
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.440
Maybe I want to change the color here.

82
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.360
And you can just start playing around and dialing in all the different properties that

83
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
you want.

84
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.760
Again, I'm just paying windows and loading the instances.

85
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.920
And you can see instead of creating this graph every time and I'll leave metallic at zero

86
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.200
there, roughness one.

87
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.560
And you'll see that very quickly we now have three different materials based on this parent

88
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.400
material, which have a powerful functionality of customization.

89
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.280
They're much lighter weight.

90
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.640
Using these material instances is just much lighter weight than using this parent color.

91
00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.640
So hopefully that gives you a good idea about how to use parent materials and material instances.

92
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.560
And the main thing you've taken away here is that when you have these materials, you

93
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.200
right click convert to a parameter.

94
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.800
It says convert back to a constant because it's already a parameter.

95
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.480
But if you create a node and you right click to a parameter, you can actually convert that

96
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.240
to a parameter and make it editable within that material instance.
