00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
It's also worth highlighting some readily available materials and textures that you

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680
can use to just get started with your project.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.520
So the starter content is the first thing to highlight here, which contains a selection

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.320
of sample meshes and assets, but also lots of materials and textures to get you started.

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.120
So whenever you create a new project in Unreal Engine from the launcher, it'll say, do you

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.560
want to include starter content?

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.520
And you can decide whether to tick that box or not tick it.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.160
It is loaded default by most templates, but you can also add it to the project at any

9
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.040
time. And if you need any kind of prototyping assets to get started with, the starter content

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.960
is a really great inclusion to a project.

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.760
That being said, you know, if you don't need it, just you don't need to add it to begin

12
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.840
with. And if you feel like you don't need it, but then need it at a later point, very

13
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080
easy to migrate into the project at any later date.

14
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.760
So just gives you a few tools to get started with that.

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.960
And then we also have the marketplace.

16
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.360
So marketplace can be found through the launcher, the Epic Games launcher.

17
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.960
And you can find this on the marketplace times here.

18
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.880
So say we wanted to add some automotive materials to our projects, we could click add to

19
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.760
projects and it says, you know, which project do you want to select here?

20
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.760
And you can add them after the fact.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.160
So these are all commercially available data, although they do contain a lot of free

22
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.520
packs on there. So you can actually filter through the free content as well if you wanted

23
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.400
to. And you can download marketplace packs through the vault, which is down here and

24
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.680
access them from any system using your Epic launcher credentials.

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.240
So very nice, flexible way of working.

26
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.120
And especially some other people might have done a lot of groundwork that you need to

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.960
just add to your project and get going with.

28
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.200
Very useful for that kind of thing.

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.200
And then also Quixel Bridge.

30
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.640
So you can find Quixel Bridge through the content menu here and inside the editor.

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.080
And this is all free data accessible directly from the engine.

32
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.520
There's a whole host of high quality assets here that you can use to just get your

33
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.440
projects up and running. It's an enormous library of 3D assets and materials and

34
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.320
textures and very easy to use in your projects.

35
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.240
Use them effortlessly. Just drag and drop and start working with the content.

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.520
It's a really, really powerful resource there.

37
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.480
But some other resources if you if you wanted to search for some more.

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.680
So lots of lots of content on the Internet.

39
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.240
Some notable examples are Texture Haven, which a URL for is there.

40
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.280
You also have the free PBR website, which is also see a URL for and then Ambient CG.

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.760
In case any of those additional resources were useful to you.
