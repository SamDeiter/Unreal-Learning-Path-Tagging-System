00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
So, we will just create a new material for this which I will right click, I got some

2
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.680
material I'm going to call this M underscore, I'm just going to call this master, let's

3
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.520
say master for now and I'm going to hit enter and then enter again and so I want to actually

4
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.880
hold down T this time so I'll go to T and press left click, I'm going to create four

5
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.440
of these so T left click, T left click, T left click and T left click, I mean alternative

6
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.800
you can just copy and paste so I could hit control C, control V if I wanted to copy and

7
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.240
paste but because it's T and left click it's quite a straightforward command to use, I'm

8
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:57.400
going to plug one into my base color, I'm going to plug one into my metallic, going

9
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.320
to get a roughness and I will use a normal map in this instance so we're going to normal.

10
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.840
Now you can see that we're error in red so let's just plug in some textures here so let's

11
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.720
go back to our content browser and actually the thing that I keep just not getting used

12
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.880
to in Unreal Engine 5, let's make use of it now, in our material we can hit control

13
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
and space bar and we can open the drawer here which is a really really handy tool for those

14
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.840
of you who used previous versions for Unreal Engine that didn't have this, you can see

15
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.960
what kind of lifesaver it is but let's go ahead and add this white square material first

16
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.840
so we want to go to engine content and so instead of the main content you want to go

17
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.520
to engine content now and for whatever reason you can't see engine content you can come

18
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.360
over to settings on the right hand side here and just make sure you show engine content

19
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.240
so we're looking out for the engine content here and then I believe it's called white

20
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.600
square texture so we can use either one of these I think they're both the same, yeah

21
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.720
well let's go for the first one I think you'll be fine with either but let's just go with

22
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.040
the first one for now so we can plug that in there we can select this texture sample

23
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.120
and under texture we can just plug that in because we've got it selected in our previous

24
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.160
window we'll also apply that to the roughness as well now we want to find a black texture

25
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.160
so we'll type in black and I think it's that first one yeah let's go for the black one

26
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.620
by one let's put that in there and let's assign that so we're just because we've got it assigned

27
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.340
in a quick draw by pressing ctrl and spacebar we are then oh there's two more up here let's

28
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.820
go with the first one I think that's going to be the safer one to pick so let's just

29
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.700
hit black there that's good and then ctrl and spacebar and now let's type in T underscore

30
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.060
normal make sure we spell that correctly and then we want this T underscore normal and

31
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.060
then we'll go back here select the last texture sample plug that in and then we'll hit save so

32
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.460
what we've got here is we've got a placeholder materials placeholder texture sample sorry for

33
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.660
our material and then what we'll do in a similar way that we did the the previous material instance

34
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.340
with the colors we can just right-click and convert this to a parameter so we'll call this

35
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:42.500
albedo texture we'll right-click the next one convert to a parameter and call this metallic

36
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.540
texture and you can imagine what the next one is going to be so right-click convert to parameter

37
00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.740
we'll call this roughness texture and then last one we'll call this one normal texture so

38
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:11.940
convert to parameter normal texture and so if we save and then go to our content browser which

39
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.980
again I'm just going to open my draw here which goes ctrl and spacebar I'm going to zero out any

40
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.100
such bar information I'm going to go back to my materials folder on my master material I'm going

41
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:35.180
to right-click create a material instance I'm just going to call this mi master maybe I'll call this

42
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.900
mi underscore master this is where you probably want a prefix of like m underscore master underscore

43
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.420
would underscore o1 for example so then you can have this big parent material and then you can

44
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.740
define based on the material type but I'm just going to call this o1 for now just so we get an

45
00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.540
idea I'm going to hit enter to open it and you'll see that we now have some global texture parameters

46
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.020
so we can actually enable all these and we can now plug in whatever textures we want into these

47
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.980
different values and that will then create a different material based on that so really nice

48
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.540
quick way to have this master material and to create some instances from that
