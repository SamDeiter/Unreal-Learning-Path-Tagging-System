Now, what we can also do is we can combine some nodes maybe to create a tint in this

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760
example.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.240
So, we can have a tint color which again we just create a vector 3 and then we'll right

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.400
click to a parameter call it tint color and then we'll multiply this holding down M on

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.000
the keyboard and left clicking for a multiply node and then we can define its role based

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.040
on this tint color.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.440
So, let's jump into the editor again and do that now.
