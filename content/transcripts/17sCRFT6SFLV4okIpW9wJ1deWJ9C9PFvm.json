  "text": " Hello, and welcome to this video on automatic asset prefixes, our fourth example. Now, just before we jump into the editor, there is a warning which is worth taking note of when it comes to working with assets. When you are manipulating assets within Unreal Engine, always opt for the Unreal Editor Asset Library or the API or the Unreal Asset Tools functions. We want to make sure that we are using the tools provided by the Unreal Library, because if we were to use something like operating system rename or shuttle.move, for example, these would break all of the references. Unreal functions by having a lot of references to different things. So if you have something like a material, it might have references to text, it might have references to textures or the actors that it's part of. By changing the name without using the Unreal Library functionality, you're going to break this, and it's going to take a long time to go around cleaning up. Now, in our previous example, we ran a script on Startup. And that script had a reference to a number of different tools and functionality in it. One of the bits that we didn't look at was we had a reference to Prefixer. I'm going to demonstrate this in Engine. But on the Startup script, we added an entry into the Tools menu script. And this is going to be a call to a program called Prefixer.py, which would be in the Python folder. So it means that we can create the function and the trigger where we need it. So let's have a look at that in the Engine. So here we are back in the Engine. And we are on slide 10, example 4. Now, hopefully, this should open up the directory so that you can see the content slides example 4. And this has got a whole load of materials and static meshes. So if I was to take this Taurus, for example, and right-hand click, you'll now see at the bottom of this list, we have the Python task section. We have Add Prefixer. So if I was to hit that, it's going to go away. And you can now see that we have sm underscore Taurus. So this has added a prefix of sm underscore for static mesh. Now, this actually works through. It's not actually the one that I click on, which is being handed to the prefix. Actually, within the code of the prefix, I am getting selected assets. So if I was to grab all of these, for example, right-hand click and run the Add Prefixer, you will see that now it has done this for everything. So you've got all of the static meshes as sm before them, and all the materials have m for material. So the code itself doesn't actually matter where it runs from. You could have it as an editor utility widget or other places. But at any one point, it's getting what you have selected within the browser. It just makes sense for it to be triggered from a menu option here, because a lot of it is about making sure that the options are where you would expect them to be, or where they are. So you could have an equivalent on here for an asset which is in the level. We could create a menu setting from here, and we would just use the selected actor in that case. OK, so let's have a quick look at the code. So here we have the prefix code. And if we look through it, it functions similar to the other one. So we've got all the ones that we've worked with. In this case, we have the system library, Unreal, and we've got all of our prefix mappings in this case. So what I've done is I've just made a list of all of the different classes that you can have. It's not extensive, but you can always add extra ones in. And it will cycle through, so it gets the selected assets. From the editor utilities. And it will cycle through all of the different selected assets and rename it and save it so that we've got what we need. OK, relatively straightforward, but a very useful script. And that brings us to the end of our video, automatic asset prefixes, example number four. And in the next video, we will be jumping into our last example.",
