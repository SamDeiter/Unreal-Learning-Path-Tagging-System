  "text": " Starting with our first tool today, let's talk about creating a texture baker. So what we can first do for a texture baker is to create a render target. So to create a render target, you just right click in the content browser, go to textures, select render target. And then you can also right click once the render target is selected to create static texture. So I'll just show you that now. So in the editor, you would just right click, go to textures, and then find render targets. And then whatever you call your render target, generally rt underscore is a good naming convention. And you can just call it rt underscore, whatever you would like there. And then you can also right click and create static texture from there. The main assets that we're looking at today to create this texture baker would be our render target, which we just created. We then need to make a material that will create some generate some kind of noise that we'll bake into. And then we also need a blueprint. And the blueprint is purely just to run the script through the construction script. So let's look at how to create the material next. So we'll create a empty material. We'll call this mat underscore baker. So mat underscore baker, which is just a prefix that we use for materials. In the shading model, so in this section of your material editor, you want to go to the material and change shading model to unlit. You can also just search that property here in the details panel for shading model, just make sure that's unlit. And then also make sure we allow negative emissive color. We then want this noise function in our material setup. So let's just go ahead and do that now so you can see. So within this material editor, my property is already set. I'm going to select noise here. I'll plug the noise into the emissive color. And then you can dial in whatever kind of properties you would like in here. You can change the levels. You can decide how harsh that noise is all through these properties here. And then some of the properties that we've used for this tutorial in this instance, you can see the settings here if you wanted to replicate this one to one. But of course, you can dial in these settings however you want. This is what's great about the tool. You can configure it to however you would like it to look like. So in this instance, this is the type of noise that we're looking at based on this gradient computational setting. And then just in the slide deck, if you wanted to screenshot these settings for any reason before we continue, they're there for you. So now we come to the Blueprint setup. And this is quite a straightforward Blueprint. So we just want to create a new Blueprint, call it BP underscore as a naming convention, and maybe call it texture Baker. So you just want to right click, create a new Blueprint class. You can just create the parent class as the actor, which is just that top setting when you're creating Blueprints, and you'll come in with an empty Blueprint. Now what we want to do is we want to create a function inside the Blueprint. So we click the functions button on the left hand side and just call this Baker. And what we'll do is we'll drag off Baker and use the draw material to render target function that's already part of Unreal Engine. And then we want to assign our RT Baker texture. And then we also want to assign our mat underscore Baker material. And that's essentially it. That is the main setup for how to draw the material to the render target. And we'll pull in this material information and it'll bake it to this render target. And all you need to do then is drag and drop the Blueprint into the level and it will bake that texture from the material into the texture. The construction script setup and how to run the function here. So we just drag and drop our Baker function and just hook it into the construction script. And then you can test it out for yourself. And a couple of things to note at the end of the tool here is that you can create multiple textures based on this Blueprint. You can go in and change the settings or if you want multiple variations of a similar kind of texture, that's up to you. The main housing is going to be your Blueprint and your material. And then from there you can create multiple render targets that are based on different noise configurations that you may want to use in some more complex shaders throughout your projects, maybe on landscapes or waters or any kind of any noise generation that you might need in your project. So again, you can just right click on the render texture, create the static texture and that will create some kind of noise for you. So hopefully you found that useful and we'll move on to the next tool. Thanks for watching.",
