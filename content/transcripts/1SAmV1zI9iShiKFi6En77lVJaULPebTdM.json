  "text": " All right, now we're going to talk about one of my favorite nodes, the Layered Blend Per Bone node. Now, do you remember in the first example where we used the Apply Additive node to add the head nod motion on top? Well, this node is way cooler than that. I would label it the Frankenstein node because you can apply animation onto a specific subset of bones. In fact, we're going to take the arm motion from the following animation and the head motion from the run animation and layer that on top of our limp walk and then presto, it will be its own new creation. In fact, the Layered Blend Per Bone node, it's really useful if you want to combine the default state machine with live streamed motion capture. For instance, you could use the state machine to drive the lower half of the body and the actor's motion could drive the upper body and then you could even record that result. So I think it's pretty awesome. This video should be pretty fun. So for our simple Frankenstein example, let's disconnect the output pose with the alt click, drag down the output pose, right click pan and give ourselves some more room and then right click in an empty space, type in layered for Layered Blend Per Bone and click on that one. Okay, I'll go ahead and connect those two nodes. Now the base pose is just what it sounds like. It's the base animation we want to build off of. So let's drag the limp walk animation onto base pose and just wait for that green check mark to appear and then release. And then if we hit compile, as expected, we see the limp walk. Okay, doing good so far. Now for the next part, if you hover over the third person jump loop, do you notice how the arms are actually up in the air? So I want to use that one for the arms. So let's grab the third person jump loop, drag it onto blend pose zero and release. And then if I hit compile, not much has happened yet, but that's because I've not specified which bones I want to override. So here's how we do that. Let's click on layered blend per bone node and then take a look at the details section in the top right. Now there's this thing called layer setup. If I expand the zero section, the zero actually correlates with blend pose zero. And this is a game engine and the coders like to start counting at zero, not one. So you just have to remember that. And then branch filters, I would actually have called this bone filters. It's fine. We can add another element to this array. And so what we're going to do is specify the bones that we want to override. But we need to expand a couple more things. So this zero, it refers to the first bone that is working with this first blend pose zero animation. So I'm just going to click on the little triangle to expand the zero. And now I can actually see the bone name. So it's a little bit of expanding and diving into the outline, but eventually you do get there. It's fine. I promise. All right. I'm going to type in clavicle underscore R. And I just happened to know that this is one of the bones that I want to use to override the animation. And so if I hit compile, look, one of the arms is now up in the air. Now notice it's not just the clavicle that was affected. It was all of the children bones underneath it. It was the elbow, the wrist, the fingers all the way down the chain. And if you're wondering, how did she know to type in clavicle underscore R? Well, you can go to window skeleton tree and now you can look at the names of the bones. So here is clavicle underscore L right there. That's going to be the next one because I don't just want one arm. I want both, right? So to do that, I'm going to go back to our branch filters and then we're going to add another element with the plus button right there. Okay. And then expand that one because you know, we've got zero. That's the first bone. One is the next bone. And I just expand that and then go to bone name, type in clavicle underscore L. And this case sensitive. So make sure you don't have any typos in there. All right, compile. And there we go. We've got two arms now. Perfect. But lastly, I also want a little bit more head motion and I don't have a slot to add another animation yet, but I can use the add pin button right here and click on that. So now I can add another animation and I want to add a little bit of a head Bob, if you will. And I want to snatch it from the third person run. So drag third person run and bring it on top of the blend pose one and release. And then we could hit compile. I mean, nothing's going to happen yet because we haven't specified the bone yet. OK, but then if I click back on the layered blend per bone node, I want to tidy up this outline and I want to collapse the first zero so that we don't accidentally mess with the bones for the arms. And this time I want to expand the one because this one correlates with blend pose one. OK, and then I want to add another element to the branch filter and then I expand the zero. Hang on. There we go. Now I want to type in head and then if I compile. And if I turn blend weight one off, I just want to see the difference and then compile. So the head is pretty static right there. And then I change it to one and compile. You know, there's a little bit more motion there and that works for me. So let's go ahead and record the motion for 10 seconds. And we're going to call it FrankenWalk. And I'll put it under mannequin animations. There we go. Hit OK. And then we'll let it run for a bit. 8, 9, 10. OK, stop. And then we now have a FrankenWalk in our asset browser. Perfect. And there you go. So you have many new tricks up your sleeve for blending animation. And in the next video, we're going to revisit state machines and a couple other concepts before we move on to fun with physics. Yeah.",
