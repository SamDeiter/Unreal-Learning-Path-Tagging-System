  "text": " Hello and welcome to this next video of our exercise. In this, we are going to be adding in the functionality to lock and unlock the door and make it so that it can be, and make it so that we can see it reflected in the color of the light on the actor. So I'm back in the engine now. And in this video, we're going to be creating a function which will change the light's color so that we can see if it is locked or unlocked. And we're going to be putting in the functionality that will make that work. So the first thing that we're going to want to do on this is we're going to want to talk about variables, because we're going to need to know if a door is locked or unlocked. And we want you to save that. So we're going to save that data in a variable. So that's all that a variable is. It's an allocation of memory on the computer where we can save data. So in the left-hand side here, you can see we have the variable section. And if I push plus, we'll create a new variable. Now in this case, we've created a transform. You might have a Boolean, but let's talk through what the different types of variable are. So if you look up in the top right-hand corner in the details panel, we have a drop down with all of the different types of variables that we can have. Now the first one is a Boolean. And what a Boolean is, is it is simply a one or a zero. And this is really useful for us to tell if something is true or false. So in this case, we're going to use a Boolean and we're going to call the variable locked. And so what this is going to do is if it is locked, we'll set the Boolean to true. If it is unlocked, the Boolean will be false. Now let's have a quick look at the next, the other variables. So as we go down the list here, we have a bunch of green ones, and these are all numeric of different varying different sizes. The ones that we're probably going to see the most is the float, which allows us to have a floating point number, like point five or point two and so on. This is great for percentages or anything where we need to get very, very specific. We also have an integer. An integer is going to be a whole number. So there's only going to be one, two, three, four. We're not going to have any floating points. It's great for counting things or knowing how many times you've been around the loop. Next, we have these pinky sort of purpley ones. And these are all different forms of text. We won't worry too much about that this one. Underneath that we have vectors, rotators and transforms. These are structs of floats. And I'll create a transform so that we can look into it. But I think one of the easiest ways to understand what a transform is, is if we go into the viewport and select anything, for example, our actor, the transform will be the first thing that appears in the details panel. And that is our location, rotation and scale. And all of these are structs of floats, which are have three values, one denoting X, Y and Z, so that we can figure out things in the 3D space. So if I was to look at the variable, I'll take my transform variable, drag it in. First choice I have is get or set. Now, if when you get a variable, all you are is reading the value that is inside that variable. When you set a variable, you are changing the value which is inside that variable. And these both look a little bit different. So I'll get does not have an execution pin and just has an output pin. Our set has to be connected up by an execution pin, and it has an input and an output. Now we talked about this being a struct. Struct stands for structure, which is a combination of variables. So if I come in here, I right-hand click and go split struct pin, you can see that I'll get location, rotation and scale. I can even go further to split the struct pin again. And that will give us X, Y and Z, which would be green, which is our floats. That will recombined. And so that gives us our transforms. Now, I will show you one last part of variables which are worth referencing. And that is references. So if I search for example, in here for actor, you will see that we have the object type actor. When I come to the right, I have four options, an object reference, a class reference, and a soft objects and soft class. Don't worry too much about them. But the blue object reference is a connection to an instance of that. So this would be a connection to a specific door, which was in the level or a specific actor. The class reference is a reference to the template that's on on disk. So that would give us things like the default values and another, and allow us to spawn something using that class. But the light blue ones is an instant reference. The purple ones is a class reference. Okay. So I'm going to delete that variable. And let's create our function. So I'm going to create a function here. Now functions are very useful because it allows us to write a piece of code. And then rather than having to have the entire code, we can just call that function and it will do everything which is inside that function. That's making a reusable piece of code and create a function and coming into the left hand side here. And I'm pushing plus and I am going to call this function change light color. As I create the function, you can see it has also massively opened them up. We have our input pin here. For this, I want to drag in our point light. First, going to have a quick look at the point light in the level. Now, the point light itself has got a very large attenuation radius. So I am going to reduce that down. Let's try 100. That's a lot smaller. I'm going to increase the intensity as well to make it brighter. So that's what our light looks like at the moment. Set to white. It's coming up as green. Pile. There you go. So this is what our light looks like at the moment. Right. So the change light color. I've got a reference to my point light. And as you can see, this is blue. That means it's a reference to an instance of a point light. I'm going to drag off the point light and I am going to search for light color. And you can see that I have a get and a set light color. And we want to change it. So we're going to go for set. Delete the duplication. I'm going to plug that into our light color. Now we have an input pin for our light color here. But I want to base the color off of our boolean locked. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag out and type in select. And under select, you can see that we have a select color. And I do that. And now you can see that we have some options here. We have three input pins and one of them is a boolean. I'm going to get our locked and place that to connect up to the boolean. And then I'm going to set a to is it locked. So you can see locked pick a. So that's going to be the locked convention. I'm going to come in here. I'm going to change our color to one and go okay. And then B, I'm going to change our color to one and go okay as well. So you can see here, we have locked, true or false, yes or no. If it's true, pick a, which is red, that is false, pick B, which is green. So we've written relatively small function, which is reusable. Now I want to come to our construction script, drag our change light color in and plug that in. Now if I look in our viewport, you can see that it's set to green. You can also see that our instance in the world is set to green as well. Now I have multiple doors. I might quite like to be able to change if they are locked or unlocked inside the browser. And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to our locked variable and I'm going to click on it so that it becomes instance editable. That means that little i is going to be visible next to the variable. And in the details panel, you can see the instance editable is going to be ticked off. Click comply. And now if I select one of these instances, you can see in the details panel that the instance editable is going to be ticked off. You can see in the detail panel, I have the option of locked. And if I tick that on, you can see that our door turns red. I've done that in the one on the other side as well. So just changing this variable will rerun the construction script, which will update the color of the door. Now that's great. We can change the way that it looks. However, this will not have any effect. Ideally, when the door is locked, we don't want it to be able to be opened. So let's come into the door and let's implement that functionality. I'm going to come back to our event crawl. I'm going to go to our E button. We'll drag this back, hold down B, left click, and that will add in a branch. Now we talked about branch. This is our if statement. If it is true, do what is connected to this pin. If it is false, do what is connected to this pin. You might drag in the lock and get it, then connect it as the input to the branch. Then if it is locked and true, I don't want it to do anything. If it locked is false, I want the door to open and close. So now if this is set to locked, we will block this function out. So let's test that out in level. Come in here, card to the door on the left, press P, the door does not open. One in the middle door opens fine. And the one on the right is closed. So you can see now we are capable of changing the settings on a specific instance and having it do something different. So thank you for sticking with me through this. Next up, we will be moving on to creating an actor which communicates with the door to lock and unlock it.",
