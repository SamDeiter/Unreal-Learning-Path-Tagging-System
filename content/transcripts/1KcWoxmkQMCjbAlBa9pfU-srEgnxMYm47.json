  "text": " There are many reasons why you might want to apply physics to a character in your project. One common reason is for simulating hit reactions when a character is struck by something. And there's also many ways to apply physics to a character, but we're going to take a look at two of the primary methods that we could use inside the animation blueprint. So we have these two primary nodes here. We've got the Set All Bodies Below Simulate Physics and Set All Bodies Below Physics Blend Weight. Now these two work in a similar way, but you have the option of controlling the blend weight of the physics effect with this lower node with the physics blend weight option here. Now the upper node gives you a great option for any chain of bones that you might want to be completely physics driven, like a character's ponytail or any chains or anything that's like a single chain of bones on the character. And this lower node gives you the same results, but you can control the strength of the physics effect. So it means you can keep that underlying core animation and just add some smaller changes or a bit of realism to the effect of damage to a character. Now we're going to jump into the engine and set some of these up just so we can see how they work. So we're inside our third person template project here. We've got our animation blueprint set up so that when we hit play, we can actually locomote around the space. Now let's see if we can add some physics simulations to some of these animations. Now we could set this up in a couple of different places, either our character blueprint or we could set it up in the event graph of our animation blueprint. Now for this example, I'm going to set it up in the character blueprint, just because we're going to set things up on a very simple key press. And the steps are the same really in the animation blueprint, but you have more opportunity there to define the inputs at runtime really. So like the bone names and the strength of the blend weight depending on what your desired outcome is and what you want driving those inputs. So we'll start off by opening up our character blueprint. And once you're inside here, we'll just find a clear space and we'll search for one of our nodes. So we're going to start with the settle bodies below simulate physics node. There we go. And you can see that it already comes in with our skeletal mesh as the target. Now this is one of the components of the blueprint. And if you were to have more than one skeletal mesh, for example, what you might find is that this either picks the incorrect mesh or it might not come with a target. If that is the case, you could pick the skeletal mesh that you want to affect, drag it in, and then just plug that into the target so we can get rid of that one. Now we need to define on which bone we want to start the simulation. So for this simple example, I'm going to promote the bone name input, which is just here, to a variable so that we can actually just write the bone name in as its default state. Now in a more complex setup, you could define this variable with some extra logic that chooses the bone at runtime, based on where that character gets hit with a trace or maybe a projectile class. But because our setup is so simple, we're just going to manually input this name so that we know which bone we're affecting. So I compile that, we get the default value here. And what we probably want to do is open our skeleton and pick one of the names from the joint hierarchy. So to do that, if I choose a third person character here and browse to the skeleton that we're using, I'll open that up and we can pick any of the bones here. So what I might do is just pick one of the spine bones so that as we activate it, all the top half is affected by the Simulet physics node. Now I could just write down the Spino too and type it into the default field of the bone name here. But what I'm going to do is, should be just a little bit quicker, is just find it in the hierarchy, right click, copy selected bone names. And then we'll go back here and we'll just paste that in and hit Enter. And that's our bone name setup. Now we also want to tick New Simulate so that it starts a fresh simulation when it's activated. And that's pretty much the setup of the node itself. Now we need to set something up to trigger the logic, trigger the simulation to begin. And I'm just going to do that in a simple button press by right clicking and searching for a number along the number row. Let's just go with number nine. And we'll plug in the pressed option so that as we press nine, it will trigger this logic. Now if we try to jump into a level here and test this, you can see it can run around and as I press nine, nothing's happening. Now if I just escape and just show you that we are pressing nine here, if we plug this in and I press nine, you can see that it's printing Hello top left. And nothing's happening. Our animation is still playing as normal. That's because we need to change the way that our collision is handled on the character. So we'll do this inside our character blueprint by selecting our skeletal mesh. And if we search for collision, we can see our collision presets down here. Now we need to change this to physics sector. Now what this will do, this will use the physics assets that we have connected to that skeletal mesh to, well, as the collision, as the bodies to simulate. So I just unplug this and get rid of it. If I compile that and save it, hopefully now when I hit play, we should have what we're looking for. So I can run around and as soon as I hit nine, we can see the top half of our character goes all wobbly and ragdolly. So that's what we want. Now maybe it's a bit too strong. So what we can do is we can bring in the simulate physics blend weight node and actually control the strength of this so that we can just say have 50 percent strength and just have some of the animation playing underneath still as well as having some of that simulated physics. So let's go and do that now. So inside our third person character, let's search for the the cell bodies below simulate physics blend weight node. And that would be this one. Now, again, it comes in with the mesh. What we can do just for a cleaner graph is use our existing mesh and our existing bone name. If I connect these two up here. Now, if I was to jump in and press play here, what we'd see if I just do it just to show an example, is that now we've plugged this in, I'm pressing nine, nothing's happening. And that's because by default, the actual physics blend weight is set to zero. So if I set that up to one, it compile. Back in the level, I hit nine again and we're back to where we were, which is great. So we've got the two nodes set up. Both of them are working and we can actually control the strength of this blend now just by typing our own value in here that we want. So anything between zero and one. Zero being the node having no effect and one being the node having full effect. So if we play in level again, as I press nine, you can see that we've still got some of the animation underneath, but we've also got this sort of lean on the character as if they're not very stable on their feet, which looks quite cool. I think we can actually jump as well. So we get some interesting results with this. But really, that's as simple as it is. So if you want to set up the nodes, you can jump inside your character blueprint. Set them up on a key press very simply. Or if you have other parameters that you want to define as your input parameters for your bone name or your blend weight, you could also define those. But the best place to do that is probably in the event graph of your anim blueprint. Just because for me that makes most sense as this is an animation edit, it makes most sense just to keep it there.",
