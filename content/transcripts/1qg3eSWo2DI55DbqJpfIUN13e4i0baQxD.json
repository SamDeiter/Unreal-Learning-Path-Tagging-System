  "text": " To create our door blueprint, I'm just going to right-click and scroll up to Blueprint Class. The door is going to be an actor based, since it's not going to take any input directly from the player. So just click Actor to get started. I'm going to rename it BP underscore door. Then just double-click to open it up. Here inside the viewport, I'm going to start putting together the actual door components. So in the top left corner, click on Add Components. And select a Static Mesh. This is going to be the door. The first thing I'll do is rename it to Door Frame Mesh. You can see that I have this ball wall and the door frame mesh component, but nothing is being visualised. The ball thing is the root, and the Static Mesh has not yet been selected, so it's not going to show anything yet. In order to fix this, we need to make sure the door frame mesh is selected. And then in the Details panel over here, you can see that there is a slot to select the appropriate mesh. Click on the None and there should be a drop-down, which will enable you to choose any Static Mesh from the entire project. You can filter this search by writing in a word here. Now, I'm going to choose the door frame from the start content by typing in Door Frame, and then I will select it. If we wanted to make this the root of the project, we could simply drag it onto the root here and it would replace it. Now, there are some advantages to this and there are also some disadvantages. Since if this was the root and we wanted to change it, then we would need to come in and change the entire blueprint. However, if we were to keep this as a sub-component, like it is now, then we would be able to change the scale and the location, and it wouldn't affect anything unless there were children of it. In this case, I'm just going to leave it as a child. Now, I'm going to add another component. Again, we want another Static Mesh for the door. So you can rename this to Door Mesh. Now, this is added as a child of the root and it does not follow the door where it goes. So I am going to change that. I'm going to select it and drag it onto the door frame mesh to make it a child of it. If when you added the component you had the door frame mesh selected, then it would automatically make it a child component. And if you've done that, that's fine. That's what we want. We want the mesh to follow the door frame wherever it goes so that it makes sense for it to be a child. Now, I'm going to select the Static Mesh for the door like we did before. And this time I'm going to choose Door SM underscore Door. And now we can see both of the Static Meshes. We just need to slide this door into position. Now, you can see that its origin point is over here on the left. And this is great because this means when we rotate and pivot the door, it will look correct in the door frame. Now, you may have noticed when you try and slide it over that it's not going to slide perfectly into position. That's actually because it has 5 somewhere in its width and the snapping is set to 10. So to change that, let's go up to Position Grid Snap Value here and set it to 5. Then you're going to be able to line it up exactly.",
