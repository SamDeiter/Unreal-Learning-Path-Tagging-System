  "text": " Texture groups are a way to help manage all of the various settings that can be applied to your textures via an INI file that allows anybody importing content to quickly select a group and have all of those settings applied without the person importing have to remember which settings need to go for what textures. Texture groups are also a great way for you to run massive content experiments without having to check content out or check content back in. As we can see on the screen in front of us, there are a bunch of different texture groups and again, texture groups are defined inside of your projects configuration file. Inside of there you will find a texture group for say world or world normal map and then inside of that texture group, there'll be various things like LOD biases, how the texture is minified or magnified by the GPU, and how the GPU should blend to MIP levels when viewed at a grazing angle along with many many other options. Now every texture that you utilize in your project should be placed into one of these texture groups. Again, this can help make sure that any issues that you run into that have to do with textures such as reducing a massive amount of textures or applying some type of unique filtering to a massive group of textures can be done very quickly and uniformly. While your project will still run without specifying texture groups, this is something that can have massive drawbacks because you lose the ability to not only control the textures sizes, but if your project is multi platform, you lose the ability to control how your textures are going to be viewed on the platforms that your project is going to support. Thank you.",
