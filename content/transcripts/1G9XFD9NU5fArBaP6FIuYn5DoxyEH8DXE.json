To do this, let's pop over to the editor. The first thing we're needed to do is go up to edit project settings. And from our project settings list here in project, we're going to go down to maps and modes. And the editor start map here is set to level 01. So we're going to go ahead and click on this and we are going to set this to our tutorial level. So actually, easier way to do this is just make sure we click in the level folder and then we're going to go to tutorial level. We're going to put that into here. Our game default, we're going to leave this as main menu because this is already actually created for us. So we don't need to change that.
