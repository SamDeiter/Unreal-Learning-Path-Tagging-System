  "text": " In this video, we're going to take a look at Nanite and Virtual Shadow Maps. And essentially, we'll be asking why we shouldn't use Nanite, especially when in conjunction with Lumen. We'll be taking a look at how you actually can use it and how to set it up. And then just have a quick overview of what Virtual Shadow Maps are, what the limitations are and how they actually work. So why Nanite? It's Unreal Engine 5's virtualized geometry system. It's a stoddard hierarchical system of smaller parts using triangles. It allows you to have a lot more geometry complexity with fewer issues. It allows for a higher visual fidelity and works really well with Lumen. Outside of Lumen, the generating of shadow maps will also take too long on a complicated mesh. So in using conjunct with Lumen, you'll get much better results. Virtual Shadow Maps are used for more realistic results. And instant object count and draw calls are less of a limitation. You can have each instance now with millions and millions of polygons and you get automatic LODs which use a cluster of data. Importantly, it's more visually accurate than displacement. You get fewer shadow artifacts than using an old system like Unreal Engine 4's material displacement. It's inaccurate, especially with extreme shadow and light changes. The good thing is again that Nanite is great for really high resolution models and you keep really good accuracy in the shadow and through the virtual shadow maps. So to enable Nanite on a mesh, it's really, really quite simple. You can open up the Static Mesh Editor and tick the Build Nanite option here and it will be built automatically for you. You can also right click on the asset, go to Nanite and enable. And if you're using Chaos, you can also change it in the Collections Editor. So you can have enabled Nanite support right there. One note actually is that virtual textures aren't required to be used with Nanite, but they are highly recommended, especially if you're making a large world. And we'll go into it a little bit later in a second, but it essentially allows the MIP generation to be a little bit more performant. So when it comes to Nanite, you can change some of the Nanite properties via the Tools Pulldown. And one important thing as well is that Nanite doesn't support hollow geometry, so non-water type meshes. And really, it does support it, it just means that the shadowing from those will be inaccurate. So you could use blocking geometry like a cube to go behind that section to actually get the shadowing that you need. So let's take a look at virtual shadow maps. The important thing about virtual shadow maps more than anything is that it significantly increases the resolution and makes sure that it matches the Nanite geometry. And this is different to just normal shadow maps, which are just essentially a texture projection. You get plausible soft shadows with really, it says reasonable here, really nice actually in control of performance costs. It provides a simple solution that works by default with limited amounts of adjustment. And it replaces the use of stationary lights in many cases and shadowing techniques with a single unified path of just using those movable lights. It's really made for lumen, it's not intended for really anything else. That's something to keep in mind. Compared to big shadow maps, the things it solves is essentially shadow maps are just like textures and can have mismatching sampling rates. So if you have more screens, more screen pixels than shadow pixels, you'll get a listen. As well as more shadow pixels than screen pixels, you get essentially wasted work, right? It's impossible to match these rates perfectly. And you also get perspective alias due to camera positions. Now when it comes to virtual shadow mapping, they deal with similar issues, but they handle shadows, they handle shadows similarly. But virtual texturing will essentially split texture and mipchain into tiles, so it only streams the tiles that it needs. So when I was mentioning earlier that it is recommended to actually use virtual textures, this is the main reason why. When it comes to local lights, you get a 16 by 16K resolution with eight mips. Spotlights use a single virtual shadow map. Point and rectangular lights use six virtual shadow maps, and that would be one per qubit phase. You get 2K more than conventional shadow maps, and it can still run out if you make massive local lights, but you probably won't be encountering those issues. When it comes to directional lights, 16Ks just nowhere near enough anyways, because they essentially work for the entirety of the world. So mipmaps are going to cover the same amount of work, but half the resolution. And we essentially use clipmap levels that are all 16K, but cover double the area. So the idea is that depending on the location, we create snaps of the clipmaps to make sure that the pages fall on the grid, and essentially get really nice shadows for the entirety of the scene, while caching stuff for a lot of fallbacks and things like that. So you can see that virtual shadow maps allow for more precise control. But let's take a look at what we can do to actually change the look of those shadows. So you can use some console variables to get better resolutions and better effects at the cost of performance. You can use some of the commands that you see here in the console to actually adjust the number of arrays. The fewer the arrays, the greater the noise. But if you set it to zero, it'll just create a straight up hard shadow. And you can also change the number of samples that are used for shadow arrays. And again, the higher the value, the worse performance. But using values between 4 and 8 seems to work pretty well. So the penumbra has limits, but you can extend those limits again if you use some of the commands for the console here. So if you use either of these, you can start tweaking the values to essentially get more reasonable looking shadows for the performance that you're looking for. When it comes to visualizing and actually being able to see what changes that you're doing are actually doing, here's some useful ones. So you've got the shadow mask, which is the final shadow mask that's being used for the shading, the clip map or MIP level. That's the chosen clip map for directional lights or MIP for local lights. The virtual page, so it's the visualization of the page address. And the cache page, which they're tinted green essentially and uncached areas are tinted red. Pages where only the static page is cached will show up as blue. So that's something to keep in mind. Again, to get these visualizations specially for anything that's actually used in virtual texturing, like clip maps and things like that, or these MIPs, you will have to turn on Shader Model 6 or run DirectX 12 like we mentioned earlier on our Lumen talk. And that's really it. After this, we're just going to load up a load of the project and just create some lights, create some glowing objects, keep things nice and simple to make sure that we can actually take a look at things properly. But yeah, mess around and see if you can create some for yourself.",
