  "text": " And so if we have come from other engines and we're wanting to get started with Unreal, or maybe you have a brief familiar with Unreal, but you're not quite sure about the game framework. Let's look at the game framework and how it actually operates inside of Unreal Engine. So to talk about the gameplay framework, Unreal's framework is essentially a collection of classes that provides you with a modular foundation upon which to build your gameplay experience. So you can decide to opt in to what elements you need for your game. And what's really foundational about Unreal Engine is that Unreal and Epic Games ship their own games. So, you know, they have experience based on Unreal very early on to Unreal Tournament. And you may have heard of a recent game called Fortnite. But essentially, Epic makes its own games. So the formula, you know, especially with Fortnite and the latest engine versions, the Unreal Engine battle tests all the Fortnite elements first and then ships those features to support that. So you know that you're getting battle-tested features out of the box. But it is useful to think about Epic's origins when thinking about the different gameplay framework classes, because you'll see how the foundations were actually built and architected around. So with Unreal Engine by default, it's built to be a network, game-ready platform out of the box. So if you think about these titles, such as Unreal Tournament, the structure does make a lot of sense. And not all the architecture will always be relevant to the game you're making. But understanding why you might use a different system and when can be helpful to understand the scope and also how you might architect your project moving forward.",
