What we're going to be doing is we're actually going to be removing and then re-adding our own custom velocity. Let's pop over to the editor now. Again, what we're going to do is we're going to first select this Add Velocity and just press Delete. When we do that, what's going to happen is our particle is just going to spawn straight down. Then we're going to go back to our particle spawn and look for Add Velocity. There we go. There's our new Add Velocity. We can tell it's new because it is set to linear. We could have come up here and change this by selecting the velocity and then changing the velocity mode. But I want us to start working with the stack as this is really important for us to be successful. Next, what we're going to do is inside of our velocity, we're going to change the default value here to 45. And while this doesn't change anything yet, this is going to be building upon some stuff so that in the future, as we make more and more changes, this is going to have an effect.",
