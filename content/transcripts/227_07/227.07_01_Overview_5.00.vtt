Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on the UMG fundamentals for HMI,

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.800
where we're talking about lights and cameras.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.800
So we'll be talking about some fundamentals of UMG, of course, by setting up a blueprint

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.800
and then diving into UMG and creating toggleable options via UMG, which is Unreal Engine Motion

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Graphics.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.700
So UMG stands for Unreal Motion Graphics.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.880
And then we'll set up some basic lights and cameras within that blueprint so you can have

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.920
some interactivity in your scene.

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.920
So let's jump in.
