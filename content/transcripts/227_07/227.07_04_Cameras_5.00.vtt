00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So here's our camera section for the UMG fundamentals.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's see what we're trying to set up here.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So we can have a series of cameras, as mentioned at the outset,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that we'll have around the car, and then we'll just cycle through them.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the amount of cameras doesn't matter,

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but just place a few cameras around your scene looking at the car.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's jump into Unreal and add those now.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I'll just go to my place actors, and we'll go to cameras,

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we'll add a cine camera actor.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I'm just going to move these around the scene and kind of look at the car.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to change the world to local, so I can kind of rotate in.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And you may want to change some lens settings here.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You know, if you want some wider shots of the car,

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
obviously the focal length may change in that respect.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So just add a few cameras here.

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm just going to change the world to grid again.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You just want some kind of nice wide shot.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So we don't, I'm not again going to be too focused on what these cameras are looking at,

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
some kind of cool angles.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Maybe, maybe I can't resist.

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's just get a nice low shot from the back there.

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Yeah, cool.

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Okay, enough with the cameras.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We've got four cameras in the scene.

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Again, the number doesn't matter here.

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We essentially just want to create some kind of functionality to cycle through them.

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So we want to go back into our UMG.

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Before that, I'm just going to save, save all before we continue.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And then I'm going to jump into the UMG.

30
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So essentially the setup will be this in the UMG graph editor.

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So we're going to pre construct again, like we had last time,

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we're going to add a few materials here.

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We'll get the cameras, promote them to a variable.

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We've got an on clicked event.

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So we'll get the next camera and the pre construct event.

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We'll gather all the cameras, store them in a button press and do all the heavy lifting.

37
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So just to note that the order of the cameras is based on the order that I just place them in

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and what you place them in the scene.

39
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So the system doesn't number and label them.

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We could do that later on.

41
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But for the purposes of this scene, let's just go ahead and add the functionality that we need.

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So we'll jump back into the editor here and we'll jump into the light cam UMG.

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We'll go back into our event graph.

44
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And we've also, we've got this display vehicle here.

45
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So on the pre construct, what we want to do this time is get all actors of class.

46
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So the mistake that I made previously, this is now why we want all actors of class

47
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
because it'll return an array and that'll give us a list of cameras.

48
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So we want Cine camera actor here.

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So I added Cine camera actors.

50
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If you just added a normal camera actor, you would just add camera actor.

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But from this map, I added a Cine camera actor.

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So that's what I'm looking for in this UMG.

53
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So again, compile and save, just get into the habit of that.

54
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And I'm going to drag off the array here, set.

55
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to call this list of cameras.

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And you'll see that it has got Cine camera actor here as a variable type, which is what we want to see.

57
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Again, if it's turned to actor for some reason, it might just be because I hadn't assigned the actor class when I promoted the variable before.

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So you just want to make sure that that's all hooked in correctly.

59
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And now we want to add an event to the on clicked to the camera button.

60
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So let's go to the designer.

61
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's go to the camera button here.

62
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm going to scroll down.

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And if I have the camera button selected, on clicked is going to be there.

64
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I'm going to add on clicked here.

65
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And so we want first an integer.

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I'm going to add a variable here and I'm going to call that integer current camera.

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Again, just capitalizing my letters.

68
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I'm going to go to the Boolean.

69
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Add an integer.

70
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so that's an integer.

71
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So I'm going to get the integer and going to get it.

72
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And then I want to also set this integer as well.

73
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So holding down alt, I'm going to set it.

74
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I'm going to drag the construct, the click into the set cameras.

75
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now we essentially want to get the current camera, add one to it.

76
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So it goes to the next camera from the list of cameras and then assign the current camera.

77
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So we want to increment this.

78
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So there is an increment integer, but we just want the add for now.

79
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So we're just going to add one to the integer like that.

80
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And then I'm going to get the list of cameras.

81
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So I'm going to hold down control, list of cameras.

82
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm going to get the length of this because the length gets the number of cameras in the array.

83
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So if I've got four in my scene, it'll get an array of four.

84
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It doesn't go one, two, three, four though.

85
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It'll go zero, one, two, three.

86
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So just know that arrays always start at zero.

87
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And we'll get the percentage sign here, which is this.

88
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We'll drag that into there and we'll just put that into there and then also get that.

89
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So we're saying now we have the next camera in the array.

90
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
That's essentially what that's doing.

91
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It's saying get the current camera, cycle to the next camera and say this is the camera that we want.

92
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So now what we can do is we can get the player controller.

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So get player controller.

94
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So that's this here.

95
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And then I want to drag off the player controller and say set view targets with blend.

96
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So we'll set that.

97
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We can change the blend time to one that I'll blend over one second.

98
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If you want to change that blend to five or whatever you want to do, you can add that.

99
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You can change the blend type easy and easy now.

100
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And you can also change the exponent there, but I'm just going to leave all those settings for now.

101
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Essentially, we just want to get the new view target.

102
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So what we want to do is we want to get the list of cameras holding down control.

103
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We want to drag off and get because we want to get a specific camera that's in the array.

104
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And the camera that we want to get is this current camera.

105
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So we can actually just drag that down there and then get that into there.

106
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that will essentially do all our heavy lifting for us.

107
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So let's just save and compile and let's just see if that works right now.

108
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So I'm going to add that.

109
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We'll see that's a nice camera that we added first.

110
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Let's see. Next camera.

111
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Next camera.

112
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And see now this is the downside of the system because now we're just blending.

113
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So you want to make sure the cameras are far enough apart around there because we just went through the mesh.

114
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But you'll see that it just keeps looping around, which is a really, really nice style camera system to have.

115
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And it just gives us that nice little polish and functionality.

116
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So we've got some cool angles and we can kind of just cycle through them.

117
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That last one, a little bit clipping through the car.

118
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So again, the order that we place them around the car will matter.

119
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So maybe you want another one at the rear there on the left hand side of this frame just to make sure it circles around the car.

120
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
But that's essentially our UMG working.

121
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And now we can dig into closing out the tutorial.
