00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As a quick introduction to the section, let's talk about what Unreal Motion graphics are and what we expect to see as the outcome today.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So you'll see we have a scene here. The UMG elements are this UI element on the left, this UI element on the right, and then the top.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the top area is what we'll be focusing on today. So we have a little button here that we'll use to cycle through some cameras.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can see in this top image we have a few cameras up here which we'll cycle between so we can get different angles of the car.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And then we'll also click this light button to turn the headlights on and off.

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So that's essentially what we'll be covering in today's course. We'll talk about extending the UI, creating the change of cameras, and also toggling these lights on and off.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So let's get stuck into the blueprint. Starting off with setting up the blueprint.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The things we'll want to do, we'll want to find this car blueprint which is called Display Vehicle.

9
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'll be jumping into my editor in a second here to show you exactly what I'm doing.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But I'm finding this Display Vehicle blueprint which you can see here.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then we'll be adding a scene component which is the holder for the light.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then we'll place two spotlights on this vehicle which will be movable because of the dynamically lit nature.

13
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We'll put them in the front headlights and then we'll be accessing these in UMG later on.

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So I'll jump into my editor here. And you can see that the scene starts out with this vehicle in the middle here.

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm just going to hit Ctrl and B on my keyboard. So pressing Ctrl and B actually navigates to the blueprint in the browser.

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can do this for any of the actors in the scene.

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If you've got other things placed in there, you can just press Ctrl and B.

18
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you had any static meshes or anything that belongs in the content browser, hitting Ctrl and B will find that in the browser.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then we can actually double click that and open it up.

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can also just click Edit in Blueprint here if you want to directly open the blueprint.

21
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But I always like to go from the content browser. So I'll double click that and then it'll load up.

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I just like to pin my blueprint to the top of the screen here just so I can toggle between the two.

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We'll see that we can go to our event graph at the top.

24
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Actually the viewport is what we want because we're adding the headlights.

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So we'll click on the viewport and you'll see that we have the front of the vehicle here and we just want to add two headlights here.

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So as mentioned, I'm just going to go to Add and then Scene.

27
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And this is essentially just an empty actor. You see that it's not got anything assigned to it.

28
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But I'm just going to rename this Light Holder like this.

29
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I'll maybe just move it out. The location doesn't really matter too much.

30
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But essentially we're just going to child two lights from this light holder so that when we move the light holder, the two spotlights would move with it.

31
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So I'm just going to add and I'm just going to type Spot here and then I'll click Add Spotlight.

32
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And because I had this light holder selected, the spotlight has now childed to this.

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If you didn't have it selected, you can go in and re-child things.

34
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So if I just added it here, for example, if you came in with it like this, you could just get this spotlight and go to your light holder there.

35
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then you could just re-child it. I just dragged and dropped that asset.

36
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So we won't try to make things look too pretty today.

37
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We're just going mainly for functionality.

38
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But you'll see that I'm kind of roughly moving this into place.

39
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Maybe I want to drop my grid down here to get it even more in line with the headlight.

40
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You could even just toggle the grid off if you wanted just to really dial in those values.

41
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But essentially we've got the spotlight here.

42
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm just going to rename this. So right click, Rename.

43
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And I'm going to call this Spotlight.

44
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'll call this L because I'm going to name it from the front of, well, from looking out at the vehicle.

45
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So I'm just going to name this L.

46
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click.

47
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I'm going to duplicate.

48
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And before we click off that, I'm just going to rename that.

49
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You can just again, just right click, Rename.

50
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Or you can actually hit the F2 key to rename that.

51
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So I'm going to select the right hand headlight here.

52
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm just going to move this into position.

53
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Again, maybe just toggling off this grid just for the time being just to dial it in.

54
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then we've got our two lights.

55
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So I'm just going to compile and save.

56
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I'll go back into my map and we can see that the headlights are casting some kind of light here.

57
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We could dial in these values if we wanted to.

58
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You could either make them a lot brighter.

59
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So if I raise the intensity there and compiled it, you can see that this headlight is brighter than the other.

60
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You'll of course want two consistent intensity headlights.

61
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So what I might do is I might copy this once I'm really happy with the value there.

62
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I'm just going to right click and paste that value there.

63
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So it's the exact same value.

64
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You can just copy the actual value and paste it.

65
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Again, you can dial in the color of the LEDs on the headlights, whatever you'd like to do there.

66
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But that's essentially our setup.

67
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Once you've dialed in the values that you want for these lights, essentially we just want to be able to see them so that we know when they're toggling on and off.

68
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So once we can see that, we can move on to the next section.
