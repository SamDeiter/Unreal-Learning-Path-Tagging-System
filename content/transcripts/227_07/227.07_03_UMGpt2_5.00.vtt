1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
Now that we've got our car set up, let's go ahead and look at adding the light and camera

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.720
controls to the UMG.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.480
So we'll jump back into the editor here.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.120
We want to now create a new UMG for this toggling on and off the lights.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.000
So we'll go to our UMG folder down underneath the blueprints folder.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800
You can see that we've got our display widget from the top and you'll see that we've got

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.200
some panel widgets here, but we've got the the HUD UMG, which is the main element.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.160
And if I, you don't need to go ahead and double click this, but if you look, we've got the

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.720
individual panel UMGs here that were created outside of this UMG here, this left and right

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.800
panel, these left and right panels here.

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.840
So what we'll do is if I just close this again, I'll create a new panel here to add to the

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360
main UMG HUD.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.600
So we can just go right click, user interface, widget blueprint, and we'll just select user

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
widget here.

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.120
And you could call this light cam underscore UMG, some kind of naming convention that makes

16
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
sense to you for what the purpose is.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.120
Again, just underscore UMG is good at the end there because then that kind of tags the

18
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
asset type as well.

19
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.880
So I'm just going to double click this open.

20
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.560
The size is just as desired, but what we would want is a size box to make sure that once

21
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.320
we've got the desired size, we can add everything in there.

22
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.120
So I'm just going to type size box at the top, size box appears here.

23
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.180
I'm just going to drag this here.

24
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.400
So we've got a size box here and then we want to get a canvas panel underneath this size

25
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.960
box next.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.760
So we'll get a canvas panel and there we go.

27
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.560
So we've got the canvas panel and now what we can do is we can build the background image

28
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.600
from this and then also have a horizontal box with the two different images that we

29
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320
want to add for both the light and the camera.

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.820
So we've got the canvas panel here.

31
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.760
We also want a horizontal box.

32
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.740
So we'll add a horizontal box.

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.500
So we've got this here and then you'll see this box here, which we can shape as desired.

34
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.080
Then we'll add a border for the images.

35
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.320
So we want a border for here.

36
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.940
So we'll type in border and then after border, we want an image.

37
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.860
So again, it's kind of just stacking these things.

38
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.060
Image if I can spell that correctly.

39
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.060
So we've got image.

40
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.960
We drag and drop the image down there.

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.240
And so what we actually want for the image is the light icon.

42
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.440
So we want to make sure we find this light icon in our content browser.

43
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.300
So I'm going to go back into my map here.

44
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.780
I believe it might be in materials, textures.

45
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.300
Yeah, so we've got our light on and off here.

46
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.220
So this is what we want.

47
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.900
So I think we want the icon background for this section here.

48
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.820
So we'll pull that into the UMG, go to image, and then we just want to override the image,

49
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.020
which should be in the brush setting here.

50
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.780
And then we'll just plug that icon in there.

51
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.880
And you can see that the sizing isn't quite correct yet, but let's just get all the functionality

52
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.940
set up and then we can go into detailing everything.

53
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.980
So we've got the icon there and we also want the camera button that we want to click to

54
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.980
go through.

55
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.540
So I'm just going to select this horizontal box.

56
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.580
Again, just the ordering of these things needs to be specific.

57
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.100
Of course, you can design it however you want, but the ordering for this example makes sense

58
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.700
in the structure that we're following.

59
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.760
So let's just go to the horizontal box and type a button now.

60
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.520
So I want to drag and drop a button onto the horizontal box.

61
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.880
And now we've got a button here and now we want an image for the button.

62
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.400
Now I'm just going to, because we've now got multiple things going on, I'm just going to

63
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.720
start renaming things as well, just as I go.

64
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.400
So button here, I'm going to right click and rename.

65
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.020
Again, F2 can do that as well.

66
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.060
And then I'm going to call this camera BTN for button.

67
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.540
Then the border here, we'll call this the light border.

68
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:41.740
So I'm just going to rename this light border and then you want the light image here.

69
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.640
So we'll just call this light image.

70
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640
So we need another icon for our camera button.

71
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.460
So let's go in and add an image here.

72
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.140
Let's go back to our content.

73
00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.460
And then we just want to select the arrow, go back into our UMG and then go to find an

74
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.460
image.

75
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.660
So image, drag and drop this over the button and the image is going to be like that.

76
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.100
So as a quick summary, we should have something that looks like this.

77
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.220
So we've created a new UMG.

78
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.900
We've got the size box here, we've got the canvas panel and the background.

79
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.020
So just making sure your structure looks something similar to this.

80
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.340
So we'll go ahead and update the size in here.

81
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.340
We'll make sure the icon is then the correct off light icon and then move to the next step.

82
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.860
So let's jump back in our editor.

83
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.420
And first, we just want to make sure that we fill out the correct boxes.

84
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.500
So we'll go to the camera button, click fill, and then also the light button and click fill.

85
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.740
So we've got one to one sizing going on here.

86
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.860
And then also the light image that we mentioned, we now just want to make sure this is the

87
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.140
correct off light button.

88
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.540
So let's just check that that's working.

89
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.140
So that looks good.

90
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.480
And then I think that's pretty much it.

91
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.420
So I think we can go ahead and save and move to the next section.

92
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.220
So we'll just compile, save and then move to the next section.

93
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.580
Two detailing settings that we need to do before moving on, which I just forgot about

94
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.700
is if we go to our light border, we just want to go back into our content and add that background

95
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.340
image here, the icon.

96
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.020
So we'll go back into our UMG on the light border, we will just go down to our brush

97
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.020
settings.

98
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.380
So under appearance, brush, I will plug that in.

99
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.700
So we have the nice looking background that we wanted.

100
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.500
And then also this camera icon just needs making a little bit bigger.

101
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.060
So on image size under brush, we'll just go to 128.

102
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.900
Maybe that can be 256 by 256.

103
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.780
Always trying to keep power of two icons where possible.

104
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.780
So I'm going for 256.

105
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.900
Again, it depends on the size that you've gone for here.

106
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.300
But we should essentially end up with something that looks a little bit like this.

107
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.740
So again, the style doesn't need to be spot on.

108
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.620
But again, just keeping in mind the hierarchy here and then some kind of visual representation.

109
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.080
We'll be moving on to the blueprints now, which is actually the main functionality.

110
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.700
So this is all mainly aesthetic at the moment.

111
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.020
But hopefully, your results should look something a little bit like this.

112
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.080
So again, we'll compile and save and then move into the graph now.

113
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.900
So if we go to the graph, you'll see that we have this pre construct node already in

114
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.900
place.

115
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.220
This is what we want to use for the display vehicle blueprints.

116
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.180
So we'll drag out from pre construct.

117
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.540
And what we'll do is we'll type in get all actors.

118
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.460
And then we want to select this top option, get all actors of class.

119
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.140
And then what we'll do is on the class to select, we want to get that vehicle that's

120
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.180
in our map, which is the display vehicle.

121
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.340
So if I just find the display vehicle, I can do that.

122
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.560
And then what I'll do is actually have created the array version here.

123
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:09.280
So I'll actually get all actors of class, get actor of class.

124
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.840
That's the one that I want.

125
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.740
So get actor of class.

126
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.560
So just get actor of class.

127
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.200
All actors will return an array, which would still give us a similar result.

128
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.740
But because we know we've only got one in the scene, just make sure it's a get actor

129
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.740
of class.

130
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.300
And then what we'll do is we'll drag off this blue pin and promote it to a variable and

131
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.260
just call it maybe display.

132
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.180
And you can see on the left hand side here, I'm typing in the reference, but display vehicle

133
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.640
ref something like that.

134
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.260
I always add ref to the end of my actor references just to make sure I know that it's an actor

135
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.660
reference, but there's some kind of name like that.

136
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.900
You'll notice that I didn't put a space between display vehicle.

137
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.340
And because I gave vehicle a capital V and ref a capital R, you'll see that actually

138
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.840
spaces the name, which is quite nice.

139
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.160
You don't need to actually add a space into your reference variable reference name as

140
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.800
long as it's got a capital letter.

141
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.420
So that's just a nice, nice tip to move forward.

142
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.800
So on construct, which essentially just means when we're making this UMG, I want to find

143
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.800
this display vehicle again, just remembering to plug this display vehicle reference into

144
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.520
there and then we want to get the reference.

145
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.280
So again, we'll compile and save whenever working with blueprints, especially just get

146
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.040
into the habit of compiling and saving and then we'll move to the next section.

147
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.760
And then what we can do is we can go back into our designer and we want to get the light

148
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.080
border and what we want to do is we essentially want to know whether the light has been essentially

149
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
edited.

150
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.720
So we'll scroll down to the bottom here again, selecting our light border and we want to

151
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.200
find the on button, button mouse down here.

152
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.560
So if we click bind, we can just create a binding here.

153
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.520
You should have whatever you named your light border.

154
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.540
If you named it light border, you should see on light border mouse button down and that's

155
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.540
essentially what we're looking for.

156
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.320
And we're just going to plug in some code here.

157
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.480
I'm just going to left mouse, drag these pins.

158
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.960
I'm going to hold down alt and left click on the executable just to break that pin.

159
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.360
So I'm going to first create a new Boolean value.

160
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.920
So under variables, I'll just add a new variable and we'll call this is light on.

161
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.080
So I normally put B at the start of my Boolean because then that indicates it's a Boolean

162
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.780
and I'll put B is light on question mark.

163
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.800
And then what I'll do is I'll hold down control on my keyboard and left mouse drag to actually

164
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.940
get the variable.

165
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.620
If you just don't click anything on your keyboard and left mouse drag, it'll ask you whether

166
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.640
you want to get or set it.

167
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.420
So you can also do it that way.

168
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.160
This time I'm going to select set.

169
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.600
So I'm going to drag that in and click set.

170
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.660
Instead of holding down control to get, you can actually hold down alt to set.

171
00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.800
So we need one get, one set, and there's multiple ways that you can add that.

172
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.140
I'm going to drag this in here and I'm going to drag off this bool here and type not.

173
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.920
So we want a not Boolean, which will be at the top here.

174
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.200
So not Boolean.

175
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.760
So is light not on?

176
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.120
That's what I essentially want to know.

177
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.800
Is the light not on?

178
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.760
And then we can just plug that in there because it's just going to flip it essentially.

179
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.720
If it's not on, it's going to be on.

180
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.160
If it's on, it's going to be not on essentially.

181
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.840
So next we want to get our display vehicle reference.

182
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.040
So I'm going to hold down control and drag in here.

183
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.640
And then we created a scene component called light holder.

184
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.640
I believe it was.

185
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.600
Let's just check what we, what we name this in a vehicle.

186
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.680
Yeah.

187
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.760
Light holder.

188
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:51.840
So what we want to do is we want to get the light holder.

189
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.720
Let's just see where this is.

190
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.200
If we childed it.

191
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.920
Oh, let's see.

192
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.240
Let's see what we've got here.

193
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240
Default scene route.

194
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.500
Let's see if we need to get the default scene route.

195
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.800
Let's just make sure we're getting this correctly.

196
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.200
So we've got our display vehicle.

197
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.080
We've got our display vehicle ref.

198
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.200
I'm just going to compile this.

199
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.040
And go back to here.

200
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.320
Let's check this out.

201
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.480
So let's just remove any binding errors to our light board.

202
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.800
Maybe I've gone in and selected a wrong button somewhere.

203
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.200
Next to brush, it's got an unbound value here.

204
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.480
So I'm just going to, that shouldn't be on yours.

205
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.160
I may have just clicked that by accident.

206
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.080
Let's see.

207
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.240
Now I can compile, save, light holder.

208
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.840
Let's see.

209
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.200
I think what may have happened here is if we look at this display

210
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.640
vehicle reference, it's just actor.

211
00:12:53.640 --> 00:13:00.040
So if I go back into my designer here, back into my graph,

212
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.600
I'll come out of this function into the event graph.

213
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.640
You'll see that this actor here.

214
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.560
So that's not correct.

215
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.600
So it should actually be display vehicle.

216
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.840
I'm not sure why it's not done display vehicle.

217
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.440
But what I'll do is I'll go back into my graph.

218
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.800
Sorry for clicking around here.

219
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800
I'll go to my light board.

220
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.280
I'm just going to delete this variable for now.

221
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.000
I'll go back to my event graph.

222
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.200
I'm going to delete this display vehicle.

223
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.360
I'm going to delete it from here as well.

224
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.640
Again, if yours says display vehicle there,

225
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.040
that's the correct thing.

226
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.120
So I'm just going to compile and save.

227
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.640
And now I'm going to call this display vehicle.

228
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.880
I'll probably just give it a slightly different name.

229
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.080
So I'm not going to add ref there.

230
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.600
And I'm just going to set that.

231
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.760
So you can see now that it's display vehicle.

232
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.320
So that's strange that it was actor.

233
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.880
Should be display vehicle.

234
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.240
If yours was actor, definitely redo that.

235
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.840
If it's display vehicle, then you've done it correctly.

236
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.520
And we'll just compile and save.

237
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.040
Now let's go back into our light boarder.

238
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.000
Now let's grab our display vehicle

239
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.040
by holding down Control.

240
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.000
Now we should be able to find this light holder.

241
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.080
So let's see.

242
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.040
Now we've got light holder.

243
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.520
If we scroll down to the bottom,

244
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.480
the variables are going to be at the bottom there.

245
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.160
So get the light holder.

246
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.680
That's what we want it to see.

247
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.600
And we'll just set the visibility here.

248
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.480
So set visibility.

249
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.960
And because the lights are childhood to this scene,

250
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.080
they'll take on the visibility command,

251
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.240
which is a nice kind of clean way of doing it.

252
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.040
If we hadn't added this scene route,

253
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.560
so in our display vehicle,

254
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.880
you don't need to flip back and forth,

255
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.760
but I'm just showing you.

256
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.440
If you see the scene component,

257
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.520
we've got two lights added to this scene component.

258
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.800
So if we change the visibility here,

259
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.040
it changes the visibility on any of the children,

260
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.320
which is a nice little optimization.

261
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.520
But we could have got spotlight R,

262
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.640
got spotlight L, opposite way around,

263
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.520
and then just set visibility on both.

264
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.200
But because we do it on the scene route,

265
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.440
it actually applies it globally,

266
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.040
which is to its children, which is quite nice.

267
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.560
So we've got this.

268
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.560
We need to get our light boarder.

269
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.040
So we didn't actually make it a variable before.

270
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.040
So let's go back into our designer.

271
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.400
On our light boarder,

272
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.840
we just want to select is variable at the top there.

273
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.080
Again, compile, save,

274
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.520
just getting to that habit of doing that.

275
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.880
So is variable is now ticked.

276
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.120
And so now we have the light boarder variable down here.

277
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.800
Again, I'm holding down control on my keyboard.

278
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.520
I'm gonna set the brush color here.

279
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.960
So set brush color.

280
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.120
And then with the brush color,

281
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.920
I'm going to select.

282
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.000
So I'm gonna drag off this blue pin here and type select.

283
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.240
So I want it to actually do a select color option here.

284
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.520
So we've dragged off the darker blue pin, select,

285
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.520
and then we'll just do like maybe a deeper gray color here,

286
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.480
and then maybe a whiter color here or something like this.

287
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.480
Just something that indicates a change of color.

288
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.560
And then I'm gonna drag the Beers light on,

289
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.560
holding down control and add that there.

290
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.600
So it's just essentially gonna set the visibility

291
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.520
and set the brush color there.

292
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.640
And we want to plug in the return node here.

293
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.640
And then we want to right click and type in handled.

294
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.920
So we just want to make sure it's been handled

295
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.000
by the event reply.

296
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.360
So we'll find this handled option here,

297
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.880
and we'll just drag that into there.

298
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.720
So that's essentially what we have set up.

299
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.320
And now we want to compile and save,

300
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.880
and then move on to the next section.

301
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.200
Now we actually want to toggle the light image

302
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.560
so we can change these icons.

303
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.120
You know, these ones that we have here,

304
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.840
light on and light off,

305
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.680
that's what we want to actually now toggle.

306
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.600
So I'm gonna go back into my UMG.

307
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.160
I want to find my light image.

308
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.080
So we go to our light image here,

309
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.960
and now we want to bind the icon.

310
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.800
So we want to create a binding here.

311
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.720
So we actually want to set the light icon, sorry.

312
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.520
So what we'll do instead of get image brush,

313
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.320
we'll just rename this over here.

314
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.360
So I'm just gonna right click the get image brush.

315
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.360
I'm gonna rename this to set light icon.

316
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.680
Which makes way more sense as a variable name,

317
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.440
as a function name.

318
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.520
So essentially we want to set the icon base

319
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.680
if the light is on.

320
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.680
So let's hold down control and bring in this Boolean here.

321
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.440
And then from the return value,

322
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.880
what we want to do is we want to drag off and say,

323
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.800
make brush from texture,

324
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.280
which is this bottom element here.

325
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.280
Now, whatever values you used in the width and height,

326
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.400
so let's just go back into the designer.

327
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.080
Whatever size you used here,

328
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.000
if it was 128, I've just got 32 here,

329
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.400
which has filled out the space.

330
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.920
But again, if you've set this to 128,

331
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.760
like we did 256 here,

332
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.760
whatever these X and Y values are,

333
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.680
that's what we want to override here.

334
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.560
So I'm just gonna go back into my graph.

335
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.080
I'm going to name these 32,

336
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.600
but if you've used 128, 256, et cetera,

337
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.080
you can plug those in there.

338
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.320
And then we just want to do another select,

339
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.320
dragging off this texture section.

340
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.920
And then you'll see that by default,

341
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.920
this select does not have this Boolean connector here.

342
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.720
But what we can actually do is if we just drag that

343
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.720
into the green pin anyway, it'll change it to a Boolean.

344
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.200
So that'll hook in nicely there.

345
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.680
And then the false is going to be the light on icon.

346
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.760
So let's go back into here, select light on

347
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.280
in our content browser and plug that in there.

348
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.440
And then true, if we go back into our browser,

349
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.600
we'll select off and then go back into there

350
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.640
and select that like that.

351
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.240
Then compile and save.

352
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.400
And that'll be our function for updating the texture

353
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.860
on when we hover over it.

354
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.600
Now we want to go back into our main UMG

355
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.320
and add this light cam UMG or whatever we've referred to it.

356
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.640
I'm just going to save everything

357
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.320
just to make sure everything's up to date.

358
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.840
I can go back into my UMG folder

359
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.440
and I'm going to open the main hood UMG now.

360
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.480
So these are all user created widgets.

361
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.480
So we want to search the panel that we've created

362
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.220
in this user widgets section.

363
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.480
So you can see a light cam UMG, which is one I created,

364
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.440
whatever you named your UMG,

365
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.000
the one that we called here, update that.

366
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.200
So if I just drag that down here,

367
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.000
you'll see that I can move this

368
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
into the real estate that I want.

369
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.600
Again, the sizing is probably a little bit too big here,

370
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.600
but I can change that sizing and positioning.

371
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.240
So I'm just going to move across this position

372
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.720
and maybe bring it down a bit.

373
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.720
Again, it's probably a little bit too big.

374
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.700
We want to scale it down by 50% maybe,

375
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.220
but that'll do for now.

376
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.540
So I'll just make sure, I'm not sure if that impacts it,

377
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.500
but I just want to make sure that box is covering it.

378
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.780
I assume it's to detect the input there.

379
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.800
So I'm just going to compile and save.

380
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.800
And so at least we've now added it to our user creation menu.

381
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.460
Now, once it's compiled and saved,

382
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.380
if we just jump back into our map here

383
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.540
and then just press Alt and P,

384
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.400
you'll see that it comes up.

385
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.940
You'll see that we've got some kind of hovering

386
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.780
going on here.

387
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.520
And if I click the light on off,

388
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.060
you'll see that the light is going on and off.

389
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.700
Now from that, I noticed that the lights weren't turning

390
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.300
on and off and also the icon was back to front.

391
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.240
So let's just jump in there and fix that.

392
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.240
So under the Lightcam UMG, in the graph

393
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.600
and then in our border mouse down function,

394
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.660
we just want to make sure that visibility is the bull.

395
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.620
So yeah, that's all correct.

396
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.820
And then, yeah, so we just missed this bull here,

397
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.500
propagate to children.

398
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.700
So let's just make sure we go in and compile

399
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.660
and save that and test it out.

400
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.700
So when we click, okay, the lights are turning on and off now.

401
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.180
And now obviously the icon is back to front

402
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.100
based on that variable.

403
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.340
So I'm just going to go ahead

404
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.780
and change around those bullion values.

405
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.860
So I'm going to go back into my UMG.

406
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.820
I'm going to set light icon.

407
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.780
What I might do is just say, not here.

408
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.380
This is kind of a little cheat

409
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.020
and you could technically switch around on and off together.

410
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.220
But let's just see if this works

411
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.220
because that'll be the quick way to do it.

412
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.880
Yeah, so off, on, on, off.

413
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.720
So there we go.

414
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.940
Everything's working and now let's move on to our cameras.
