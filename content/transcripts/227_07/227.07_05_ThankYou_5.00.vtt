00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
So thank you for watching today's course on the UMG fundamentals.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
Hopefully it's given you a good deep dive on some of the UMG construction,

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.200
both adding buttons and icons that you can click, and then also just adding some blueprint functionality,

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.320
whether it's toggling on and off a certain element from say the vehicle lights,

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.640
or even just adding cameras to the scene and knowing how to pan around the scene

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.320
using some basic camera scripting. I mean it got a little bit complex there, but once you know it,

7
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.360
then it's implemented and it's really really nice straightforward system to use,

8
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.280
and you can kind of add that customization to your project. So thank you again for watching,

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.480
and we'll see you in the next course.
