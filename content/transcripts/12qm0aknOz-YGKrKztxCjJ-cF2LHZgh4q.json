  "text": " The next thing we want to do is to paint in the landscape with the material so we can get an idea of the different types of effects that we can get the visual fidelity of the landscape. So today we're going to be setting up a really basic landscape material. This is just an overview of the material. I'll be going step by step through in the workshop section just in a few seconds here. I just wanted to give you a quick overview in case you wanted to jump ahead. So we're making a material with the landscape. We're blending between dirt, rock and grass. Again just very basic block colours for now. And then we'll also be creating a normal map just to give it some offset there. And then also you just need to make sure you apply that landscape material when selecting the landscape to the landscape material section. And then also when we're painting the layers you just want to go for a way blended layer. So we're just going to jump in now and create the material based on this first set of properties here and let's just jump into our editor and create the material now. So in our editor I'm just going to create a new folder for these materials. So I'm just going to right click in this free space, go to new folder, I'm going to type materials and then I'm going to hit enter to go into that folder and then we'll create a new material. So this is going to be M underscore landscape. You can choose the naming convention that fits you best. I tend to use M underscore for materials. You can use mat underscore. It doesn't really matter what naming convention you use as long as you keep them consistent for your project and if you're working in teams just keep that consistent. So I'm going to open this material here and the first thing we want to do is to create three different vectors. So I'll hold down three on my keyboard and left click. I'm going to hold down three again and I'm going to hold down three again and we want to right click convert to parameter for each one. So we're going to go, we're going to type grass for this one and right click convert to parameter. I think do we have rock here and I'll just right click the last one, convert it to a parameter and hit dirt and then we want to do a layer blend and we will select the landscape layer blend at the top there. Now on the bottom left hand side here we'll add an element and we'll add three altogether and we'll drop down the box, layer name, we'll give this dirt and the weight blend is fine there for the blend type and we'll call this rock and then the last one we'll call grass. We'll plug one into there, rock into rock and grass into grass and then we'll go to base color and we'll save and now let's move on to the next step of the landscape whilst it saves. Now that your material is saved we just want to give each one a color here so give your dirt some kind of maybe off orange brownish type of color, the rock I'm going to give this one maybe an off purple kind of bluish type of color and then grass we'll just make sure that's more green in this example and so each one if you just save that and then I'm just going to pin this landscape material to the top of my browser here just so I can still go back to it. I'm going to click onto select mode just so I can select the landscape okay and then I'm going to come up to here and we want to go down to the landscape material slot and we just want to make sure our landscape is selected here and then you just want to plug that in there and so by default what we've got is we've got the top layer of our landscape so if I go back to here you'll see that all these three are assigned so now we just need to start painting in the information into the landscape. Next thing we'll do we'll go back into our landscape mode if you had come out of there and just make sure we go to our paint tab this time at the top and we'll scroll down and we'll see we have our layers here. So we just want to make sure we go to the little plus icon we'll go to weight blended layer and we'll click plus on that and then we just want to make sure we have a dirt layer and just save that and then we'll go to the next one do the same process and then we'll also do the grass normal there we go and you may want to rename this folder it's not the most ideally named folder but as long as we've got our layer info that's the main thing. We'll just go to the file save all just to make sure we don't lose any progress I'm going to create a maps folder now and I'll call this P underscore landscape demo and I call it P underscore because that just means persistent map it's just a name and convention I like to use but again as long as you have your own name and conventions for depending on the project that you're working on that's fine and so everything's saved we're ready to start painting it's always just good to save your progress as you go and you'll see that the dirt layer is selected by default we may want to start painting grass in so we may get this grass selected here I'm going to make my paint size a little bit smaller I may want to bring that down a little bit maybe to 200 and then you can just start painting directly into the landscape so it might take a couple of seconds to rebuild the shaders but at least you can see that you know I'm painting my beautiful grass into this rock into the dirt sorry and then maybe I get some rock and again it's going to think about the shaders to begin with but essentially from now you can just start painting you can start getting an idea for the blend between each one I mean maybe you want some more severe examples of colors because these colors seem to blend quite nicely or maybe that's the desired impact that you want but essentially similar to how when we were sculpting the tool we have paint we can smooth smooth out the blend so if we wanted to create more smoothness between each of these textures again this is more just down to refining and moving around your scene and and just getting a feel for what works best for you and just remember that the default layer that the landscape is going to be on is going to be this top layer so if you wanted like everything predominantly grass maybe you do the layer blend differently maybe you'd start with grass at the top again it doesn't necessarily matter too much what that ordering is but by default unreal is going to pick that top layer so it's just something to keep in mind but once you've got that in place it's essentially just down to again just playing with the tools painting in the landscape and just just playing around with the different effects that you can get",
