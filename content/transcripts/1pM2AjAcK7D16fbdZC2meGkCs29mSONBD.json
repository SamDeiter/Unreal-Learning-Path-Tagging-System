  "text": " All right, now that we have our player controller set up, we're doing our line trace, what we're gonna do now is we are going to go to our Activatable Actor Blueprint and create a new child blueprint of this. And we're gonna set it up to work as our light. So let's just pop over here to the editor, Control-Space to bring up our content browser. And again, we want to create a child blueprint of our Activatable. So there's our BP Activatable. So we're gonna right click on this, Create Child Blueprint Class, and we are going to call this BP Light. All right, so let's double click on that to open it up, bring this on screen. And we're gonna come over here to our Components, and we are going to add a new component, and we're gonna add a Point Light. There we go. And we do want to make sure that our Point Light is set to Movable, which it is. There we go. There we go. Just make sure that that is set to Movable. And then what we're gonna do is we're gonna come over to our Event Graph. And inside of our Event Graph, we're going to click in here, and we're gonna look for Event Activate, and we want this Event Activate object. And what this is is this is looking for our BPI Activate interface. And from this, we're gonna grab our Point Light here, and we're gonna left click and drag. And if we just, again, left click and drag off of that, and look for our toggle, we can grab this toggle visibility, and we can connect like so. So what this is gonna do is this is going to set up our Point Light so that it can be turned on and turned off. So let's just compile and save that. And next, what we're gonna do, we're gonna do something very, very, very similar. We're gonna create a child blueprint of our usable actor. We're gonna add a cube to that, and we wanna make sure that this cube static mesh has some type of collision. And then we're also going to be creating a variable that we can actually select inside of the level and use that variable to target our light switch. So let's go ahead and come back over here. We're gonna hit Control Space. And again, this time we're gonna go to our BP usable actor, right click, create a child blueprint, and we're gonna call this BP light switch. And then we're gonna double click on this to open it up. Now, first things first, we're gonna come to our add, and we're gonna look for this cube, and we wanna add the cube. I'm gonna leave it at this size, this large size. If you wanted to, you could come here to the scale and change it, make it a little bit smaller, but we don't need to do that. The next thing that we need to do is we need to come over here to our variables, and we're gonna add a new variable, and we're gonna call this new variable light. And if we come over here to our variable type, we're gonna look for our BP underscore, and we want this BP activatable, and we want an object reference to this. Now, we're not quite done with this yet. The next thing that we need to do here is we need to come down to our variables, and we need to enable this public option. So what this does is this allows us to select different lights once this has been placed inside of a level. So we'll go ahead and compile and save. And we're not quite done yet because the next thing that we need to do here is we need to set up some event graph logic so that we can actually select the light, check to make sure that it is valid, and then call our functions to turn it on and turn it off. And we do that by coming over here. Gonna come to our event graph, and again, we're gonna look for our event use, and there's our event use object from our BPI usable, and then we're gonna grab our light variable here, and we're gonna get its current value. And then I'm just gonna left-click and drag off of this from BPI usable, and we're gonna look for is valid. And we want this is valid with a question mark right there. So is valid. What object do we wanna make sure is valid? Well, we wanna make sure that this light is valid. We wanna make sure that there's something in there. And then what do we wanna do if it is valid? Well, if it is valid, what we wanna do here is we want to do an activate object. Ah, there we go. Activate object, there we go, that's what we want. We want our activate object target is BPI activate. We also need to give this a target, so it needs to know what we want to operate on. So we're just gonna go like this, and then we're gonna plug this in like so, and just like that, there we go. Just move this over, make it a little bit easier to see. So there we go. All right, so let's go ahead and compile and save that. And the reason we were doing all of this is so that when again, we're gonna put our light switch in, but our light that we see right here, the ability to select that is directly related to us coming in here and setting this light to public. So let's go ahead and set this up by, I'm gonna hit control space, control space. We're gonna grab our light switch. So there's our light switch. All right, and then I'm gonna grab our light. There's our light, which is right next to it. So there we go. And then if we select our light switch and we come over to our, looks like I don't have a details panel, so we're gonna fix that by coming up here to window, go details, detail panel one, and there we go. I'm just gonna bring this over here on my screen. You can see here underneath our default, we have this light. So if I grab this eyedropper, I can select the light. So let's go ahead and hit play. And what should happen now is when I press E, let me get close to it. There we go, it turns it on and turns it off. Turns it on, turns it off, look at that. And the other cool thing is that if we were to come here and I'm gonna hold down alt and select this one and grab this one right here and hold down alt, we can have this select different ones. So check this out. This is kind of cool. So that turns that one off. That one turns that one off. Or if we wanted to, we could even have these two select the same one. So we could have like this one. Whoops, there we go. So you can see here we turn this one off and then turn it back on over here. So that's pretty cool. And again, here's what we get. We get our light on and our light off. Oh, everything.",
