  "text": " All right, so now that we have our PlayerPawn set up to actually receive a score and a time pick up, it's now actually time to create that pick up. And we're going to be doing this by first creating a new blueprint and using Actor as the parent class. Let's just pop over into the editor, hit control space to bring up my content browser, and then I'm going to come again up to my content folder. Just going to right click in here, Blueprint class, and then base this off of Actor. We're going to call this BP underscore pick up. Once we have done that, the next thing that we're going to do is we are going to open up our Blueprint and add a sphere collision in a static mesh. And we're going to set the static mesh shape to Taurus. So let's go ahead and do that now. So again, we're going to come here, we're going to open up our BP pick up. And then on the components, we're going to click on this add, and we're going to look for a sphere collision. Okay. And then we're going to click on add again, and we're going to look for a static mesh. There we go. And then for our static mesh, I'm going to come over here and we're going to look for a, I don't know, let's just use this arcade sphere right here. And I think that's actually a little bit too big. So what we're going to do is come here to the scale and I'm just going to point two five, maybe point one. Yeah, there we go. That works. So point one, scale that down a little bit. So that is perfect. Now, the next thing that we need to do is we are going to select our sphere and then we're going to go to the events and we're going to press the on component begin overlap. What this is going to do is this is going to automatically create an event for us that is going to fire off once something has begin to overlap this component. So very simply, we're going to grab this sphere right here, our sphere collision. Let's scroll down and keep on going right here to our events. I'm going to say this on component begin overlap. I'm going to press this plus sign right here, which is going to kick us over to the event graph, adding to that node and then focusing us right there on that node. Now, with that node added, the next thing that we need to do is we're going to do a check to make sure that the item that we're running over does implement our interface. And then if we do, we are going to basically make a call and then set our score and our time. Now, the reason that we're making sure that when we overlap this particular actor that it implements our interface, it could be very easy that you have a player pawn or an AI pawn and you don't want the AI pawn to interact with this. You only want the player or maybe you don't. In our case, we only want the player. So we do want to make sure that whatever interacts with this pickup object, that it does have our interface in it. So to do this, we're going to come here and we are going to first off of our other actors. We're going to look for those. And then right there does implement interface and the interface that we're going to be checking for is our if I type in BPI, we're going to find it right there. A BPI stats interface. Then what we're going to do is this is returning a Boolean values. Remember, Booleans are true or false. So we're going to look for a branch and then under utilities flow control, we're going to add a branch. You can also add a branch by pressing the B key on the keyboard and left clicking that will add the branch node as well. And with our branch added, what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect the execution of our on component begin overlap to the input on our branch. Miss that input. There we go. And again, I only want this to fire off if we do implement that interface. So I'm going to take the return value from our does implement interface and plug that into our condition. And this is going to make us a check. Next, what we're going to do is we're going to pull off of the true here because we want to make sure that when this is true, we actually do something and we're going to go. Pick up object and we want this message, so the message is going to allow us to basically say, hey, I have received this. What do you want me to do with it? And for us, what we're going to do here is first things first. We're going to take this other actor and we're going to plug this into target. This is just ensuring that we are actually working on the correct. And with the correct interface, I'm also adding to reroute nodes to make it a little bit easier just to read this graph. Now, this score and time pick up is going to be something that is placeable by a level designer or level artist. So next thing that we're going to do is we are going to expose some parameters, more specifically for our score and time. We are going to make these both instance edible. So to do that, this is really, really simple. What we're going to do is we're just going to right click on the score and promote to variable. And then I'm going to pull this down like so and then do the same thing for the time promote to variable. And I'm going to pull this one down as well. So I'm going to just stack these right over here. Now, I do need to compile and save this. There we go. And last but not least, again, I want these to be editable when this is placed inside of a level. So to do that, we're going to come here and we're going to make these variables public by pressing this little I right here. It will now be editable once we have placed it inside of our level. So we're going to go ahead and save. And the last thing that we need to do with this is we're going to add this destroy actor. Now, what this will do is this will destroy this actor or remove it from the gameplay level once we have finished. So let's go ahead and do that now. So we're going to come here and we are going to just drag off of this and look for destroy. Destroy. And there's our destroy actor. So, again, just to recap, we first added our sphere and our sphere collision. OK, and then we shrunk our sphere down to point one because it's a little bit small. We then grabbed our sphere right here. And then in our details panel, we came over and on component begin overlap was added to our event graph. We then check to see if the component or the object that we're overlapping enter has our interface. And if it does, we are then going to make a call to give a default score and a default amount of time. And then we're going to destroy this. The last thing that we need to do here for our integer and our time, our score and our time, I'm just going to set the default values of these to five. We don't necessarily need to do this, but with everything that we have going on at one time, this will make sure that once we go to test this, things will work and then we're not sitting there stuck scratching our heads, wondering why something isn't working. So this does it for this particular section of our video tutorial series. Up next, we're going to be taking a more in-depth look at setting up Unreal motion graphics and then how we're going to wire all of this together to our blueprints.",
