  "text": " So, no lighting and artistic pipeline would be complete without an art review. And so with that, we're going to use our trusty turntable of sorts and just kind of mimic that with our scene. So if you want to follow along, just open up our 06 final. So with this one, if I expand out environment, you'll see that we have our artistic and yes, I corrected a few things because it was terrible. It was gaudy, but you know what? That's fine. So with this one, I've just added a little bit of the artistic effects back into it. We're using our dual post-processing. I for the most part have my lighting set. That's good to go. Now what I want to do is just add a little turntable effect to our vehicle and actually see that in action. So that's going to be very quick for us to do. Now before I add the component, one of the things you may notice. So in this particular workflow, let me go ahead and just go up to here, that your field of view might be set at default to 90. In fact, I've been working this whole time in a different field of view. So with that, you notice that it's very fish eye, which, you know, doesn't look supernatural. You know, it looks more like a game. And so what I want to do is I'm not adding the cinematic camera at all, but I do want to change this viewport. So to do that, just select this little drop down next to your perspective. And underneath your field of view, just change this. Now if you want to go with something that is very, very common in the film industry, the, you know, the cinematography, which is, you've probably heard of it called the nifty 50, which simulates more of the human eye. You can take your field of view down to something like 50 or 55. And that kind of gets you into something that's more proportional. So 50, I think works great. You of course can go down even further. Let's say that, you know, it's more like a telephoto lens. Let's go something like, you know, a field of view here. Let's type something like 20. You see it's really punched in. Now, if I kind of zoom back, you know, it's very flat perspective. So for this one, let's just use 50. That looks pretty good. I'll kind of position my camera just a little bit where I wanted to. There we go. Perfect. All right. So let's put some movement on this bad boy simulated and see how it looks. All right. So what I'm going to do is just go into my world outliner. I'm going to select the Audi A5 DS, which is going to be our blueprint that we imported from Datasmith. I'll go ahead and delete this, this rotating movement, because if you're following along, obviously, if you opened up the final, this is going to be everything that we have. I'm going to go ahead and delete this because yours should look like this. And now what I want to do is add exactly what we just deleted, which is a rotator component. So I'm going to select this Audi A5 DS. And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to do add component. And what I'm going to look for is our rotating movement. So I'm just going to type in rotating movement. And there we go. I'm going to click it and add it. And there we go. All right, cool. So that's probably good to go. Let's actually see what it does. Get ready. It's going to just rollercoast out there. So I'm going to go up to our main toolbar here. Right now I have this play. I'm going to select a little drop down. And what I'm going to select is simulate. So it should be by default selected viewport. If you click a little drop down, let's do simulate. And what that's going to do is that's going to kick the engine off as though it were running to see what it is. But we still have control of our camera. So let's go ahead and click simulate. And boom, they go perfect. So that's a perfect way for the director to be like, hey, isn't that cool? Look at it. Look at it fast. There it goes. No, it's actually moving way too fast. Let's go ahead and just stop that. We'll just stop the simulation. Let's go back to our vehicle, which should still be selected at this point. If not, just go ahead and we can just click that Audi A5DS, which is the route. Let's select a rotating movement and let's change the rotation rate of Z to something like 15. And that should be a lot better. So now we'll click back into our viewport, click simulate. And there we go. That looks much, much better. Thanks for watching.",
