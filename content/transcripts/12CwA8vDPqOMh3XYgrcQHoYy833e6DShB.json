  "text": " Hello and welcome to the next video in our exercise. In this we are going to be programming the gameplay behaviour. So for this I would like you to open up GB underscore sitting down. This is our gameplay behaviour. When you open it up you're going to get a screen that's a little bit like this. Now this is a data-only blueprint at the moment. What we're going to want to do is add code. So if you come up here you'll see that there is an option to open the full blueprint editor. If you click on that you should get something that looks like what we're more used to working. What I would like to do is first come up to the functions that are overrideable. What we're looking for is the onTriggered character. There's a number of onFinished and there's a number of onTriggered. But different events are going to give us different pins that we're going to be able to access. And this isn't a task, it's a public statement tree, so we're not using the variables and the context to get data in and out. So I'm going to select onTriggered character. That's going to print out this viewhead. Now I'm going to be referencing these values quite a few times. So to make it neater I'm going to save out a couple of these two variables. So the first one I want is the PaveTimer. Right-hand click and you can see we have an option to promote to variable. Put that in, it creates the variable and we're good to go. Now the second one is the Smart Object Owner. So what I would like to do is right-hand click and again promote that to a variable and plug that in after you have it. Now after I've done this, the first thing that I want to do is turn off the collisions on the chair. Now the collisions are going to be different smart objects. So I'm not going to hard code it here. What I'm going to do is drag off of the Smart Object and I am going to go turn off collisions. And you can see our interface, we have an option to turn off collisions. So that's going to send an interface message to just turn off the collisions. It's a nice quick way and we'll put the code on the smart object itself in a minute. Next up, what I would like to do is I want to make sure we have the loop target set up correctly. And we saved that variable to the AI. So unfortunately, we're going to need to do a cast at this point to make sure that we have it. So I'm going to drag in the avatar and I'm going to cast to BP underscore NPC chair. And once I have that, I'm going to get off of the. And once I have that, I'm going to drag off and I'm going to find the smart object transform. And get the smart object transform swap. This is the variable that we made in that piece of pre-written code. And then I am going to get component. And the component that we're looking for and here is the motion warper. Motion warping compute. And the component that we're looking for in here is the motion warper. Motion warping component. And I am going to add or update warp target transform. I'm going to plug that in and I can connect that up to the cost like this. Now there's one last thing we need to do and that is set the warp target name. In this instance the name is chair. So just set that to chair. That's quite straightforward. Unfortunately this is the only sort of non modular part at this point. But what we're doing is we're just updating the warp component so that we can see it. Now we are all ready to play the montage. What I'm going to do is I'm going to again grab the avatar. And I am going to go play, amy, montage. And we have the animation montage here. We're going to promote this to a variable. And in the default I am going to search for sitting down. So that is our animation montage. This is the first time that we're playing animation montage. Now you may have noticed that we're using this animation montage node, not the normal one which has the character pins for when it ends. That's because we're unable to use those kind of nodes within the gameplay behavior. So we have to be a little bit cleverer in order to make this whole thing run correctly. So the first thing I'm going to do is you see this return value. This is going to return the length of the animation in seconds. I'm going to promote this to a variable. I'm going to name this animation. And I'm going to press type. So we'll just run the animation and record the loop. Next up, I want to wait until this animation has finished running. And have a bit of idle time in the middle. So rather than having me out the pin, what I'm going to do is drag off and go set timer by event. And we have an input for a tiny. So what I'm going to do is grab my animation length and I'm going to add to it. I'm going to add three seconds. Plug that output into the timer. So we'll call in the animation, wait for however long the animation is, plus three seconds. And then it's going to kick off our new event. So I'm going to drag off here, go add custom event. And I will name this custom event. Stand up. So for this custom event, I want to do two things. I'm going to create a sequence. So I'm going to do two things relatively immediately. Now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to bring in our avatar. And I'm going to get the mesh. And from this, I'm going to play a montage. So and I'll select. So I'm going to plug in the montage again here. Now I already know the time, so I don't need to use the other one. So it doesn't really matter because I'm not using the alpha pen. I'm using the sequence here before. But what I would like to do, what I need is the starting position and this play root. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the animation length. And I'm going to plug that into the starting position. So that means we're at the start of the end. However, I do not want the play root, the length to be one. I want it to be minus one. And that is so we're playing it backwards. So what this will go away and do is it will run the animation backwards, starting at the end. I'm not worried about any of the other output pins on this. That's all I'm using this for. And once this animation has been run, we are going to have to come out of this. So again, I'm doing what I did before and that's set timer by the event. And we know this is going to run for the same amount of time. So I just need to plug in the animation length. Now I'm going to drag off a CAD custom event. And this event I'm going to call stop montage. Now there's a couple of ways that you can stop the montage, but our goal is to go back to the previous animation. Now one of the things we haven't mentioned before by borrowing this up is if we were to go away and actually look at the montage itself. I'm going to double click on the montage. You can see that we have a couple of odds and sods in here. So the first one is we have our motion warping section at the top here. So just add in add state motion warping. So that is required. How to get the motion warping to work on the animation itself. We need to make sure that we have root motion turned on. So let's have a quick look at that. So if I was to fire that up, this is the animation. We need to make sure we have the enable root motion here. Fire that back to our montage. The other element that we need is we need to disable the enable auto blend out. And the very simple reason we're doing this is because when we play the animation, we're wanting the character to stay at the end of the animation. So we're turning off the enable auto blend out. However, this does also mean that we're going to have trouble coming out of the animation because without the blend, it's not going to seamlessly convert back to the animation blueprint. And that's why we're doing the little bit that we're doing next. So if we went back to the sitting down, we're stopping the montage. Now there is a node that will allow us to just directly stop the montage. The problem with that is it will jump back to the animation blueprint and it will pop out because there's no blend. So what I'm going to do instead is I have created another animation, which I'll just call transition. And it goes to select here. There is very little to it. But what it is, is it is the character in the idle mode, which means that we can now blend out this animation. And that should give us a relatively perfect blend. So I've created this and all it is, is a very, very short section of the idle animation with the blend out automatic ANA so that we don't have to have the plot at the end. OK, so how I'm going to do this is again, I'm going to drag our avatar. And I'm going to drag off and get this kettle of tin mesh. Picked any of these to kettle it down, so it's interesting to do that. And I'm going to play montage. All the montage OK, I'm going for a transition. Everything else can be kept normal. And on the blend out, I'm going to end the behavior. And control and say. And thanks for sticking with us with that one. And next up, we're going to finish off some mods and sorts and get this up and running.",
