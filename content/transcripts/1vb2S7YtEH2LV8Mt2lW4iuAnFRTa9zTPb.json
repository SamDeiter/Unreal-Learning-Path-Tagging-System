  "text": " The next optimization of view mode I want to talk about is quad overdraw. Now, quad overdraw is used to help determine areas which are going to cause your GPU to go into overdrive trying to calculate triangles. Now, the reason for this is that GPUs work on a two by two quad granularity, which means that small, thin triangles that are smaller than two by two pixels result in extra work for the GPU to have to do. Quad overdraws will show you which meshes could be suffering from this issue and allow you to make better, more informed choices about how to approach that. Now, the cool thing about quad overdraw is that the easiest way to address this is to simply add a level of detail and then reduce the level of details geometry so that you can still have mesh that has a silhouette that is similar while being cheaper to render. One other thing to note about quad overdraw is that if you're working on a VR project, quad overdraw is particularly important to have to pay attention to because remember VR is rendering not everything just once but everything twice. So any way that we can cut down on the amount of work or overwork the GPU has to do will be a big win for optimization overall. As with all of our other view modes, we want to try to keep the view in the ideal to moderate. And again, the idea here is to look for areas that have issues and not try and over optimize to make our entire scene completely blue or green, destroying the artwork in a negative way.",
