  "text": " Alright, in this section let's continue our final recommendations with a discussion about workspace layouts. The first thing that I need to point out is that your workspace layout is entirely up to the user. With that established, we do have some recommended layouts for specific tasks and hardware configurations. Our first recommended layout is for single monitor users doing sequencer, editorial, assemblies, or layout. The position of your menu tabs is fully customizable, but it is highly recommended that you work using a split view viewport. As you can see in this image, the viewport is split among the default and cinematic view. Viewport 2 is entirely optional and up to the user preference. The dock tabs and tools work counter-clockwise starting in the upper left-hand corner with the Place Actors tab, moving below that to the Content Browser and to the right with the Sequencer and the Sequencer Curves tabbed together. Take Recorder is optional and is a long, skinny tab that sits between Sequencer and your Outliner and Detail panels. The Outliner and Levels are tabbed together, as is the Details, Multi-user, and Live Link panels as well. Now, let's jump into the engine and change the layout so that you can see what it looks like when I have a split view. So, if I move into my viewport, I want to set one of the viewers to the cinematic view and make sure that both are lit and perspective. To do that, I move up to this 3- button and move down into my layouts. From my layouts, I choose 2 panes side by side. Now, with 2 panes side by side, I do go into my perspective and make sure that I'm in perspective my cinematic view, I make sure is both in cinematic view and under the 3 dots, can we allow cinematic control? That is checked on. For my other view, this is my default viewport. That default viewport needs to make sure that it does not allow cinematic control. And the reason for that is so that as I connect and use cinematic control, I can also move around in the viewport at the same time to allow for organization, movement, and adjustment while still being able to view whatever the action is inside my cinematic view. Now, once you're all set, you can save your layouts by going up to the windows menu, moving down to the layouts, and save your layout. Now, I want to point out that there is also some options for not just saving your layouts but sharing them. By exporting that layout, you can save the layout to any other user within your studio. Now, let's jump back to the slides. Let's look at some other options that you might consider for other functions. Here is an example of a single monitor for animation work. A more expansive viewport and stacking for the sequencer is a layout I recommend as the animation tools will open up different menus and tabs but also require a larger view area for sequencer. The viewport is a split view but this time it is optional as your default view and cinematic view are not accessed while you're animating. The viewport tools that then get docked into the bottom below the viewport, which are sequencer and the sequencer curves editor for faster and better animation and keyframing. On the left side, we have just two tabs that are stacked and that is our place actors tab and our content browser. On the right side, we have a lot more tabs that are stacked. Three stacks, the first being our animation and animation outliner. Next is our outliner, details and levels along with our anim details panels. And finally, optionally, we can put in the multi-user and live link if we have any kind of real-time interaction and recording happening. Next, we have an example of a layout that users can set if they have a dual monitor or ultra-wide monitor hardware configuration. Again, I want to emphasize that your working layout is entirely customizable in order to meet the individual user preferences. And I want to remind you that any layout that you set can also be saved among users and shared around the entire studio. Finally, I want to point out that on occasion, you might run into a bug when switching back and forth between saved layouts that will cause the engine to crash. So just be a little careful there. That's it for this section. In our next section, we will continue with more of our final recommendations.",
