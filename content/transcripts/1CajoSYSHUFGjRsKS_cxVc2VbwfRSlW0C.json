  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on creating assets. We'll be walking through the process of how you go about creating an asset from new rather than importing or duplicating ones. We're already there. In order to create an asset, what we need to do is we need to use a specific class called the factory. And these factories come in numerous different types. So do feel free to search through the API and just type in your specific what you're looking for. And you can select the factory for that. Now, when we're looking at factories, and we're going to be jumping into this in a minute, the factories are going to be quite high up classes. So we're going to be playing around with the blueprint class, but that's going to include anything that's below that blueprint class. Let's say you want to create a material, for example, you're going to want to go and find a material factory and then use that one to set it up. And there's an equivalent. So you can see here, I'm just showing the factories, which are starting with A. So you can imagine that there are a lot of them. What I'm going to do is I'm going to walk through an example of creating a factory so that we can create an asset. Before we jump into doing this within the engine, I'd like to stress the point that our base directory we're going to be working with is slash game. Now, it appears when we're in the editor as content, but it's actually when we're working with Python, it's the slash game folder, which is going to be is going to be important to us. And here we are back in the editor. And as you can see, if I hover over, it says all slash game. And you can see that it's the game directory here that we're working with. OK, so I am going to be setting up this script in using the the editor tools. We should be able to see it here. Now, the first thing is we're going to import Unreal. And I've got a blueprint name of cool asset, and we are going to create this into the game slash example folder. Now we want to create a blueprint, so we're going to need to find a factory to work with. And so I'm going to say reference to our factory and call this factory and we'll call it factory equals. So I'm going to jump into the API and I'm going to search for blue print factory. OK, and you can see that we have here is Unreal blueprint factory. And so that's going to do I'm just going to jump on that. But all I'm going to need is blueprint factory. It's got a bunch of editor properties here, and this will be relevant when we're going in mainly parent class. But we are we don't need that for this line. OK, so our factory equals. Unreal blueprint factory, and we will we don't need to add any parameters. OK, so now in order to create this, we're going to have to actually use something called asset tools. And if I was to look into the directory again, we had a file here. We had to find asset tools here, but this is going to have a number of elements. And the main one that we care about is the create asset, because that's what we're going to need. And you can see here we're handing it the asset name package, asset class and the factory in order to get this to work. OK, so I am going to create my reference to the asset tool. I'll do that up here. Asset tools equals. That equals. Unreal dot. Asset. Tools. Help us. Dot get underscore asset. Tools. OK, so you can see that we have the get asset tools here and we got the factory here. Get rid of that. Just move that up. So we have most of our settings set. Now, in order to create something, all I need to do is. Type in. Asset. Tools. Create. Asset. And we will use the blueprint name that we saved at the top. And blueprint path. Should copy and paste this and we go none. And finally, we'll provide it with the factory. OK, so here we have the factory. OK, so here is the moment of truth. Will this run? Yes, it's a run. So we have our example folder here and we have a cool asset. So we've created an asset. Now, if we were to open that up, we would find that this is the standard blueprint of a parent class actor. Now, what if we want to create something different? Well, when we're creating a blueprint class, we usually have the option to pick the parent class. And that's what we can do through the set editor properties. So if we were to go back the Unreal Blueprint Factory, you can see that we have the editor properties here that we can set through get set. And we're looking at parent class. So if we want to type that in, it would probably be something like factory dot set underscore editor underscore property. And we want to set that to parent class. And for this, I'm going to set this to the Unreal dot player controller. OK, fingers. I'm going to delete this. And fingers crossed. There you go. Now you'll see that we created that. And this is now of the parent class player control. OK, so I just wanted to walk through the process of how you'd go about creating a blueprint class. I just wanted to walk through the process of how you'd go about creating assets, because that's the main sort of confusing part. You've got to use these factories and then you've got to set the editor properties in order to update them. And that brings us to the end of the creating assets video. I hope you find that useful.",
