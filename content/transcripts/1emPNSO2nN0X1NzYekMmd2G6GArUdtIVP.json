  "text": " One of the other techniques that's often accompanied by using the separate alpha workflow is something called RGB Mask Packing. What this means is taking different textures and putting them in the red, green, and blue channels of a texture. While you can utilize the alpha inside of that texture, remember alphas make textures take two times the amount of memory because that information is uncompressed. So unless it's absolutely, positively needed to have information that comes in at full resolution, I highly recommend you just use the red, blue, and green channels of a texture. Inside of the editor, once you've imported that texture, make sure under the texture settings that you do things like set compressed without alpha to make sure that any alpha information is removed. And you set the compression settings to masks, no sRGB, and that sRGB is disabled. Now, the reason that I bring this up and what makes it a big point about it is when you actually bring a mask texture in and set it up originally, it's actually going to work right out of the box. And we can see this demonstrated in the screen in front of us on the left hand side with the incorrect version. If we look at this bush, it actually looks pretty good. It doesn't actually look like anything is wrong. But upon closer inspection, especially if we zoom in and the area that's highlighted, this area is actually missing a bit of detail. Now, on the right hand side, we have the correct version, which is the same texture just with sRGB disabled. And notice in the zoomed in area, we actually have a lot more branch information there that is actually just completely missing in the other image. And again, remember sRGB is disabling gamma correction. So if we utilize our masked textures with gamma correction enabled, we're actually going to be changing that data. We're going to be raising its luminosity and we don't want that. Remember, masks define where something should or should not be. So we always want that information to stay the same. And that's why it's so important to make sure that on any of our masks that we're using, that we have this disable sRGB as this is going to help us get a better.
