  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at editing materials and some things to look out for. So let's get started. So I have a scene here that you can grab if you go to the content drawer and you go underneath our class number and you'll you'll see here it says maps and we're looking at lit 203 underscore four and in there we have a file called simple. This is basically a little kind of like a content sample layout here which toll talks to you and shows you all the different aspects of about things to look out for when it comes to ray tracing. So this initial one here talks about materials. We're going to spend a little bit of time here. You'll notice I have two different aspects of materials here. I have one that says ray trace manual switch static switch parameter and the other one says ray trace quality switch replace in here. So this one automatically makes it so that your quality switch replaces in here and actually it will do some work for you in your scene based on your photon calculations and distance. So if I go in here and click on this particular material, let's go to that switch replace here double click on that material. Let me drag that scene into here and you'll see we have two different types of material choices here. Now what I mean by that is buried in the material or to make material attributes. And if you're unfamiliar with materials, you simply just say make material attributes right there. And what we did was we collapsed the final destination here, result of the material right here with this that says use material attributes. I'm pulsating my cursor here as you can see it. So in here on the very top is our normal material, the one that we kind of want to shoot for a little bit higher quality. And down below is a ray traced dumbed down one in here. Because it is dumbed down is because ray trace and materials can get can get expensive. So you just got to be careful with that. Here's our ray tracing quality switch replace. And that node can easily be found simply by typing that in ray tracing quality switch replace on the bottom here and in there that is plugged into here. So at the top will be a bit more complicated down below, be a bit more simplified. And that makes it so that Unreal will do a replace when needed and make things a bit more optimized. Now, there will be a little bit of noise in your material and you can see it here based on the roughness. So let's actually look at the switch parameter option and then look at that concept of roughness. So the material next door is just a static switch parameter. So say per shot, maybe not working in games, but you want to use ray tracing for final production. You can actually switch this at your leisure. So if I go into my material here, it says element one, I'll pulse my cursor so you can see it. I'm going to double click on this. You'll see in the parent material, click on that, that I have a switch replace. So at any time, if I want to, I can switch between a simple scalar parameter or texture. The texture is going to be a bit more expensive. This is going into the roughness because when it comes to roughness in Unreal, when it comes to ray tracing is that roughness is going to bounce back to the camera and it's harder for those photons for Unreal to digest the visual intention of those photons because it has to determine what is rough and what isn't to give you the proper look and feel. So shinier is cheaper than a higher rough surface because it has to parse between those. So if we go into our scene here and you can again use that switch, static switch parameter, you can create that in Unreal. If you go into your scene here, I give you an example of that. Here's a roughness low and there's a roughness high. The roughness high, believe it or not, is more expensive. Now it looks pretty great. We have the more and more versions of ray tracing comes out, the less noise we get in our objects, which are pretty awesome. You will see a little bit around the edge here as it's right next to that object. As I move it away, you can see almost like an outline. So just be aware of that. Unreal is trying to determine the roughness back here versus the roughness here. And this one's closer to the camera. You'll notice this one has less noise and it doesn't seem to have as much of a sorting issue because it is a high or I should say a low roughness. This is high roughness, expensive and low roughness is cheaper. So shinier the object, the better it is and easier on your GPU calculations and your frames for second. Pretty cool. So those are the ways to try to manage it. You can do a manual switch. You can switch it on and off based on your needs or distance, or you can have a real do a little bit for you with our quality switch replace. And over here, here's some notes on those same topics. So the next thing we're going to talk about is looking at our lights. That's it with this one.",
