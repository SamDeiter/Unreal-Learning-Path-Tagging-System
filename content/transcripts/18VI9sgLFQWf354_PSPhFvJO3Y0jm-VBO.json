  "text": " So, travelling. Travelling is basically the concept of either moving from server to server or connecting to a server in the first place or indeed our server moving to a new map. So two notions that are instantly worth kind of highlighting is the idea of seamless and non-seamless travel. These are kind of slightly more meaningful from the client's perspective. Seamless travel means that there will be a non-blocking, i.e. asynchronous operation when travelling to the new server. On the other hand, in contrast, non-seamless travel is going to cause a blocking load. So this is a little bit like when you load a texture or a sound, if you do an asynchronous or a blocking load, it's basically going to... a blocking call is going to force disconnect the client from the server and then once that's done it will reconnect the client to the same server which will now have the new map loaded. So there are three scenarios in which non-seamless, i.e. the kind of blocking load where they disconnect and reconnect, must occur. When loading a map for the first time, either we don't have this map kind of cached, when connecting to a new server for the first time and when ending a multiplayer game and starting a new one. And then there are kind of three core functions that drive and utilize these different forms of travel. So we'll kind of quickly look at those. So first we have the browse function. Essentially, this is a hard reset when loading a new map and it'll always result in non-seamless travel, as we kind of said about the disconnecting and reconnecting. This causes the server to disconnect all current clients before travelling to the new map and the dedicated servers can't travel to other servers. So when we're talking about travelling, we can travel via a URL. That URL can either be a server IP or it can be a kind of local map content location. This has to be a map location, a server in the context of a server. It cannot travel to another server because that's a kind of not, servers can't connect to servers. So it has to be a local map URL. And then we have server travel and client travel. So server travel is held in the new world, client travel is held inside the player controller and this kind of occurs in order. So server travel is for the server only and it will jump the server to a new level. All connected clients are going to follow that server and the server is in charge of calling that function. And it's the server itself that will then call client travel to the connected clients, to each of the clients that are connected. So at that point client travel will get called and, well, okay, the server can call client travel. If client travel is called from a client, then it's about travelling to a new server. If client is called from the server, then it's generally going to be an instruction to transition to a new map. And this is going to be that seamless travel where we're going to maintain that connection to the server and just move to a new map. But obviously we already talked about the various situations where this is impossible, i.e. we don't have this map loaded before, we've never connected to the server before or ending a multiplayer game. So the other kind of thing that's worth mentioning when we're talking about travelling or transitioning between servers or more importantly maps, it's worth bearing in mind that the game mode is one of these things that will persist by default. But also the game mode has this function get seamless level travel actors list that basically gives you the ability to specify a list of actors that will travel between levels seamlessly. So anything that you need to kind of persist to keep your game up and running, the things you only expect to get spawned once, that might be things that you put in this seamless travel actor list. All controllers for players with valid player states, from the server's perspective, will persist. All player controllers from the server's perspective will persist. And all local player controllers, so if you're the connected client, your player controller will persist between travel.",
