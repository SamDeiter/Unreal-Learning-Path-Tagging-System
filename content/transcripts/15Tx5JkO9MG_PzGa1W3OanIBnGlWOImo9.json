  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at parent materials and instance materials and how to add new features to get your material to be a bit more robust. So let's get started. So one of the things I want to emphasize is make sure that you work from a parent material and you make and always get in the habit of making instance materials from those parent materials and then apply those instance materials to your objects. The reason why you want to do that is you can actually control a set of parent materials where one handles translucency, another one handles flesh, another one handles hard surface organic, another one non-organic. You can actually categorize things in such a way and make instance materials from those parent materials to have quick control over your environment without having to recompile your shader. So this is a very optimized ideal way to work in Unreal to get changes quickly done and to be able to swap out textures. As you can see here in the instance material, we have quick access to these and we can also control variables. Let's briefly take a look in Unreal at what I have set up for you. So in Unreal, we have a sample material. This one's just a little shadier than probably what you have in your scene. Don't worry about it. It's still the same thing. And this is concerning our first topic. Now I'm going to double click on that material and we can see that we have full control of this material. And you will have several sliders as we can swap out also the texture. You'll notice down below we have a metallic switch. Now yours is probably off by default, but with it on, you'll notice at the top we actually have a metalness area and I just loaded a simple blank white texture. In the parent material, these can be any textures because in the instance as we're in here, I can swap them out at any time. So if we turn this off, you'll notice now we have the ability to control our base material via a slider. And that'll control our intensity outside of a texture. Let's move that back to default. And if we turn that back on metallic, you'll now see the texture populate. And that's what we're going to build. We're going to build this in Unreal. And this is what you call a static switch parameter. It makes it a lot easier for your material, especially if you don't want to actually use that 4K material for an object in the distance. You can turn some of these off. Now there are some things in Unreal that automatically do some of this for you. That's for more of the advanced classes. And we're not going to get into it here. Let's momentarily get back to the slides and then we're going to jump back into Unreal and build some of this. So step by step, I'm laying this out. So feel free to follow along. And you can even use that material sample that I have that'll help you and point you in the right direction as you're building things out. So let's go ahead and start building the static switch parameter. I'm also going to point out to you a few other ways you can build nodes to make your material a little bit more stronger in the use and function and to just make it more robust. And then we're going to take a look at that UVs up close. So here in Unreal, I'm going to move this out of the way for now. And we're going to go and make our own material. Let's go and right click here. And we're going to put it on this white object here. I'm going to click on material and we'll call this M underscore demo. And I'm going to double click on that material. He's off screen, but we'll pull him into screen. There we go. That's better. Now at any time you can go in here and again, open up that material that I've made by simply double clicking on it. But I want to point out if you've forgotten, you want to go to the parent material. If you want to see the structure and what I'm going to be building, and that's going to be helpful for you. Let's go to our homegrown material here that we made. I'm going to go full screen so you can see everything as we're building things out. I'm going to cheat a little bit and I'm going to borrow that first part when it has the albedo information because we already went over that in the first class and we want to make sure we're using our time efficiently. So I'm just going to copy this for now and I'm going to paste it into our scene. And then we're just going to connect that to the base color. If anytime you want to be able to have a quick way to be able to make a scalar parameter such as this little guy here and have it directly connected to any of these nodes, execution nodes here, you can actually right click the metallic and say promote to parameter and then look, hey, we have a metallic control or even specular right click promote to parameter. Like that, we have specular control. Now that's really up to you, but that's a quick way to do that and saves a bit of time. We're going to make our own metallic because we're going to create a switch for it. So I'm going to delete this part. What we want to do now is go in here and make our metallic texture. So I'm going to actually borrow that texture again. It's just a white blank texture. I'm just going to copy this from the original and just paste it in here for now. Next I want to go in here and I want to make a multiply as well as a few other things. Now we'll keep this metalness. We don't need to change the name. Keep my finger the M key, left click. There we go. Keep my finger on the S key. Now if I want, I can do a promote to parameter to have it quickly connected to that B and just rename this and we'll call this metalness intensity. And if it helps you, you can say texture driven. And we'll make sure we set that to one so it's always on. I'm going to connect that texture that I have. And again, I'm just using a generic one. And now we can make a switch which will derive between us going in here, whether we want to use a texture or we want to use a scalar parameter. To do that, I'm going to right click in here and type in scalar or I should say static, sorry, static switch parameter. There we go. So we need a static switch parameter. My apologies for that. The static switch parameter is going to make it so we can flip between the texture and using a scalar. I meant to mention scalar, but I for some reason called him that temporarily. Sorry Mr. Static switch parameter. Don't mean to offend you. And we're going to call this here metallic. And if we want to, we can just put a question mark because like whether you're using texture or not, it's up to you how you do that. We can't promote this one because it requires logic in here. So what we can do is just keep your finger on the S key left click. And this is going to be our base, base, no texture metal. I'm going to put that right into false and I can leave that at zero. We'll be fine. Multiply it to true. And then we're going to connect that to metallic. So now if I apply this, we find that material. We lower this just a little bit. I can right click in here and say create in a material instance. If we go into this material instance, I'm just, I'll dock this here. We can see we have the albedo, albedo tint, albedo, uh, density there. We also have base, not metal. So we can control this here, not metal texture driven. But if we want to, we can turn on the texture part and what we do, it shows up to the party. There it is. And we can control the intensity of that down below. Now again, I haven't grouped these. We've already talked about grouping, so we don't need to group this. You guys kind of get the idea of that. And to save time, I haven't grouped them in this particular case. And then now we can control how strong that's going to be. Pretty sweet using that static switch parameter that keeps things a little bit cleaner and makes it so that if you need to switch them and you don't need that texture information can make things a bit lighter. There are other areas where you can actually make things a bit more complex. And this is derived from my sample. And I'm copying this particular group of nodes and just want to point them out real quick. So this set of nodes that I have here, this allows us to go in here and even have a cheap contrast as well as actually be able to control the albedo tint. So if I wanted to plug that in, I would have that ability to do that. Now there are multiple different ways to get cheap contrast. And obviously this is called cheap contrast. And this allows you to be able to do that. Now these things we're going to talk about later. These are called material functions. These material functions allow materials to have functionality and they open the doorway for us to actually make a more customized look and feel. And that will be towards the end of this course. Let me go and delete this for now because we don't really need it. Let's go and make that UV set. That's going to make things look a lot better. So to be able to handle or edit our UVs, we're going to need a couple items in play. One of them is I keep my finger the U key left click. This is my texture coordinates. The texture coordinates here, I'm going to keep my finger on the M key and we get multiply. What we want to do is have overall tiling. This texture coordinates is going to act like a gateway so that Unreal knows our intentions and it knows that it's whatever I connect to this, it's going to be able to do that. And so if I connect to this, it's going to lump things in such a way and understand that I'm using this for UVs. I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep my finger the S key. I'm going to call this tiling. This is my overall tiling. And you can say if you want to, you can call it like tiling overall. And I'm going to connect that into the B channel and UV coordinates and connect it into the A channel. Set this to one to make sure that my tiling is on. Next, this is a micro setup here or I should say macro, what's controlling the whole set. What I want now is to have a little bit more of a micro setup where I'm controlling things on the U and the V. So I'm keeping my finger on the S key. This is going to be my offset U. I can duplicate that, control D. That's a key for that. And I can make this offset V. I want to make sure that both of these are on. So make sure the one is on for each. There we go. But to be able to be able to do to to get this to work correctly, I should say, to be able to be able to do this, we want to use a thing called a append vector. So I'm going to type in append vector. What this does, it allows us to be able to actually have a secondary control. And we can pipe this into an add or multiply. So I can grab this UV offset, plug it into the A channel, grab this offset here and plug it into the B channel. And now if I want, I can choose, let me hit the A key, A and left click and add. Hit my finger, the M key and left click or multiply. Now, the difference between these, if I did add things would shuffle and stay pretty linear, straightforward with no size changes. And I'd have to connect this here and have to connect this here. Or if I want, I can do multiply and I prefer multiply because it scales it a little bit and can maybe hide some of the imperfections for the texture. So I can do that. So I can pull this into the A channel and pull this into the B channel. And then I grab each one of these and put it into the UV slots for each one. And then I hit apply. With those plugged in, we're going to hit, make sure that you hit save. I just hit apply. And then now we look at our instance and you'll see we have UVs all ready to go. Now, again, each one of these has a different UV. Again, each one of these should be in a group. I didn't do it because just to save time and we went over in the first class. But you can now see down here the UV, the offset U, the offset V. You'll see it's scaling and then the overall tiling. So again, using that and the multiply or the add can determine how that's going to shuffle. And I can show you really quick. So I go in here and then switch this to an add for both of these and hit apply. We can now go in here and change things. And you'll notice it's a lot linear. There's no stretching going on. Now, it does make it so it repeats more, so it squishes it. But the other way around, multiply has a little bit more of a scale connected to it. Well, that's it with this lesson. We're going to take a look at creating masked materials.",
