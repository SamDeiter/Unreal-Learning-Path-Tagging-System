  "text": " Hi everyone, thanks again for being a part of this class and I hope you got a lot out of it. What we covered today was different ways to be able to create your layered materials the old school way, the mega scans way, as well as the new way to be able to do so and how efficient that works. We also covered NPCs, how to use material parameter collections, how to get them set up in Sequencer, and how to just mainly get a good foundation for them and build them within your material to be able to do whatever you want. We also talked about materials in the case of subsurface profiles as well as subsurface materials in general and we also looked at the occlusion, parallax occlusion and how to actually set that up and how that works in general also. As well as looking at advanced subsurface materials when it came to creating such things as ice. So that's each one of these topics I hope you got a lot out of and we hope to see you soon again in our classroom. Thanks again.",
