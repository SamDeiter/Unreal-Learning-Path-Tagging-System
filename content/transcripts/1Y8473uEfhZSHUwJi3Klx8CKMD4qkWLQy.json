  "text": " Another new feature in Unreal Engine 5 is Mass Entity. This is a framework for data-oriented calculations. A Mass Entity's primary data structure is the Fragment. A Fragment is a data-only element and it represents an atomic piece of data that can be used in calculations. Examples of Fragments are things such as Transforms and Velocity. It's important to note that Fragments cannot be created in Blueprint at present. Fragments can be grouped into Collections, and these Collections can then be associated with an ID. This Collection of Fragments is then what we call an Entity. The ID associated with the Entity can be used for quick lookups, and creating an Entity is similar to class instancing in object-orientated programming. However, instead of directly declaring a class and its functionality, Entities are built up by Fragment composition. An example of an Entity, we can take two Fragments such as Transform and Velocity. These two Fragments now form our Entity, which would then give a unique ID. Again, it's important to note that Entities are data-only elements, so they have no internal logic within them. Moving one step further, we have Archetypes. Archetypes are a Collection of Entities of an identical composition. Archetypes are composed of different types of Fragments in a specific configuration. Taking our previous example of an Entity made up of a Transform and a Velocity, we can build a Collection of Entities that hold the same configuration giving us our Archetype. So let's take a look at a visualization of an Archetype. We can see that we have an Archetype that holds an Entity made up of Transforms and Velocities, as per our example. Now let's have a look at how that Archetype is organized internally. Entities of an Archetype are organized in memory chunks. Arranging data in chunks like this ensures best performance when retrieving Fragments associated with Entities of the same Archetype from memory. Processors are stateless classes that supply the processing logic for Fragments. It makes use of Entity queries to specify which types of Fragments they need to perform their operations on. A good example of a Processor is the MassApplyMovementProcessor, which is already present in the latest version of Unreal Engine 5. Entity queries provide batches of Fragments to the Processors with their regard to individual Entity Identifiers. As we can see here, we have an Entity query that will return our Processor to arrays of Transforms and Velocities, the exact make-up of our example Entity. A Tag is a trivial Fragment that contains no data. The existence or absence of a Tag is used as data in its own right. Tags are part of the Entity's composition. A Chunk Fragment is a Fragment associated with a Chunk instead of an Entity. Chunk Fragments are used to store per-chunk data, which are used in managerial processing, like calculating levels of detail. They're also used as part of the Entity composition system, much like Tags. Moving on to the last major addition to Unreal Engine 5's AI suite of tools, we have the Zone Graph. The Zone Graph was envisioned to be a lightweight navigation system that are laid for pathfinding even with non-screen portions of the world, and for general control of direction and navigation. The Zone Graph uses metadata to represent specific navigation flows such as traffic lanes, sidewalks or wood trails. This metadata is represented as a point-to-point corridor structure connected by segments. In the next few slides, we're going to take a look at how we can define our own corridor structures. There's a few critical classes we need to take a look at when defining a Zone Graph. Firstly, we have the Zone Shape. Zone Shapes define the area and shape of the Zone Graph lanes. Zone Shapes need to be configured with a lane profile, which determines the number of lanes, tags, direction and width of the lane. Next, we have the Zone Graph Data. The Zone Graph Data is the built navigation data for the Zone Graph, and it's very similar to the Raycast Actor that is present when using NavMesh. Zone Graph Data is not built automatically whilst the user is editing. It's instead built on demand via the Build, Build Zone Graph tool from the menu bar. However, we can enable automatic Zone Graph building by enabling the Build Zone Graph Whilst Editing flag in the project settings. Next, we have the Zone Graph Testing Actor, which is used for testing if navigation is possible between two testing actors, similar to the traditional navigation testing actor used with the Raycast NavMesh. These testing actors can be configured with a query filter, another actor to test the navigation between, and optional tests to be run when attempting to navigate. The testing actor can also show other debug information related to pathfinding, such as its path lane, its linked lanes, smoothing and the BV Tree query. Finally, we have the Zone Graph Annotation Testing Actor. This actor allows for any number of tests to be run to simulate annotations at a specific point. Custom tests can also be created to match a project's specific needs. Let's take a look at how we create a lane profile. To create a lane profile, you simply do the following. Go to Project Settings, Zone Graph and press the plus button to create a new lane profile. In the example we see above, we define a new profile that we've named Two Way Traffic. We then add two lanes to this profile, both with a width of 150, and we define the direction of both of these lanes, one being forwards and one being backwards. And that concludes Introduction to AI in Unreal Engine 5. Today we learned about AI controllers and how to control them either through behaviour trees or state trees, as well as how to store information for use in them on the Blackboard. We've looked at the Navigation Mesh and how we can query information about the world with EQS. We've learned what forms of perception AI can use straight out of the box. We've also taken a look at some of the brand new features in Unreal's toolset, the Smart Objects, Mass Entity and Zone Graph systems. Thank you so much for watching and have a fantastic day.",
