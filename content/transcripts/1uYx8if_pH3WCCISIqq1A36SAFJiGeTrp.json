  "text": " So we'll be creating a new material that essentially mimics what Quixel Megascans delivers with their materials for the most part. To get an idea of what that is, I'm selecting this stone material shader ball. And if we look in its details at the bottom right, we can see that its material is called salt mine wall. And by double clicking on this or showing it in the using a magnifying glass to show it in the content browser. Double clicking either of these will bring up its material editor. Double click and. We can see actually it's not the material editor, it's the material instance. These are the tools that were created by bringing in something like a Quixel Megascans text material. We can see that the parent material is available from the details panel of the instance. We can see that some of its attributes have been turned on. And we can get to the parent material and we'll be creating a parent material much like this. By either double clicking here or again, by using magnifying glass. Next to the parent material, we can find it in the content browser. So double clicking either of these will open the parent material. The other way to get it, I should mention, by the way, is to choose this hierarchy button in the toolbar of the material instance. This shows you who the parent is, or if this were a parent, who the children are. So if we go to the same hierarchy button in the parent, we can see that there are, well, actually several children to this and you could look at them individually. This is the type of thing that we'll be creating. I say the type of thing because what we're interested in doing here is building the tool that mimics this. We want to take this material and turn it into a kind of a template for building other materials. And give it more robustness than the initial Quixel Megascan material might have. So we'll be looking at certain attributes, not all the attributes material can have, but a pretty robust collection of attributes. That's a good starting point for almost any material. So albedo, metallic, roughness and normal. And you can see in this material editor that we've provided that we have some other node networks we put together just for you to play with and examine at a later time. We'll be building this type of a network and we'll be adding UV controls into it for tiling and repeating textures. So to do this, we'll create a new material from scratch in our Mask Material 201 folder in class material. Don't worry about this instance that may or may not be there by the time you receive the project file. You can safely ignore that and we'll create a new material by right clicking in the content browser and scrolling up to material. Once we left click and release, we have our new material and the name is selected and we'll call it M underscore for material. We'll call it new parent. Because what we're doing is we're just creating a sort of a template for a new parent material. By double clicking on it. We open it in our we open its material editor. And I'm just going to. Increase the size of the window so it fills fills our window. And if you have this. Default parent material open, you can drag this window off to another monitor to follow what we're doing and you could select nodes from here and copy and paste them into are the one that we're creating. If you have been examining something and want to catch up or you can just use it to follow along. So I'm just switching between tabs in our in our window. And to begin with, we'll. Create. A texture sampler node will need several of these for our. For our template material. So to do that, we'll start with by creating the albedo node and by holding down the T key and left clicking. We get a texture sample. No, the other way to do this, you might recall, is to right click and search for texture material, texture sample, and it's it's right there, but I'm not going to do it again. We'll do it later. I'll click away from that on the grid. And for this, we'll just be using any kind of texture, really. It almost doesn't matter as long as it sort of fills out our understanding of what it is we're trying to do. We want this to be an albedo texture. And so with the texture sample created, if we look in the details panel underneath the viewport, there's this texture. Display that says none, and indeed, there's none there. The drop down next to it also says none. But if we click on it, we can. Find textures that are available to us and. We'll choose albedo is really the first one, so we'll select that and that's an albedo texture and it shows up in our window later. We'll probably be using some textures from the engine content, and if the engine content isn't available in your project, let me show you quickly how to bring that up before we get too far into this. So I'm going to drag this window away and see if engine content is available or not. In the content browser itself, if you go to the bottom right, there are view options, and if you click on the view options, you'll see a whole list of options available, and among them is show engine content, and we see that that is not selected. So it's not in our it's not available to our content browser. But if we do select it immediately populates. The content browser with engine content actually adds two folders and in the engine content folder, there are a lot of things you can explore later, including textures. Now we didn't need it for our albedo texture, but we may be using some textures from there in a while. We want to change the name of this. We want to open what this contains to the tool that we're creating, the material instance. So to do that, we need to expose its parameters, and we can do that by having the node selected, right clicking on it and converting to parameter. Once we've done that. We can rename it albedo. And we can also. Create a group for it so that when we build our. Instance of our tool instance of this tool, it will have everything associated with albedo in the albedo group, so we'll call this albedo. And as we have in our intro to materials class done. We'll want to be able to adjust certain attributes of the albedo. So, for example, we'll want to create a tint for it so that we can change the overall look of this material. And for a tint which uses a color, we'll need three vectors, three values that we can that represent R, G and B and to add a three constant vector. Hold down the three key and left click and we have. Our three constant vector or constant three vector. We want to we don't want to initially change the tint of this when we plug it in, and so we want to basically zero it out and zero in this case is black. We want it to be altogether white so that it actually has no shading effect on it at all. To do that, we need to get the color picker for it, which we can do by double clicking on this color chip or single clicking on the color chip in the details panel representing R, G and B. So if we double click on this one, we get the color picker and all we're going to do here is increase the value hue saturation value all the way to one. That sets it to white. And we can close it. The next thing I want to do is rather than add a. And add node which would brighten the intensity or a multiply node which would darken the intensity, I want to introduce you to a new node. Called the blend overlay node. There he is. We get the node that will actually improve with some colors. There it is. We get the node that will actually improve the contrast in a way that neither add nor multiply can do. We'll pipe the RGB of our albedo into the base and our tint into the blend. Now if we, this is actually a is a material function, not one that we built here, but one that actually just comes with the engine. that do, they're available in your palette, which is in the window palette and anything that starts with MF is a material function. These are all built in. We'll be building our own from scratch later, but there are a good number of them included to begin with. So we have more room, but just know that they're already there and they can be pretty complicated. This one is reasonably complicated. We can see how it works and what it's doing by double clicking on it. Notice it has a sort of blue color. That's an indicator that sort of what slate blue color. That's an indicator. It's a material function. If we double click to open it, we see all the nodes it has and kind of how it works. So the way it works, unlike add or multiply, is it evaluates each pixel of the map and It evaluates them not only by the luminosity value, but also by the luminosity in each of its color channels, red, green, and blue. And so for any pixels that has a value greater than 0.5, remember the sort of scale for this is 0 to 1, 0.5 being the midpoint. So anything that has a value greater than 0.5, it will enhance or increase its luminosity. For any pixel that has a value under 0.5, it will essentially darken it. And it'll do so based on the luminance value by each channel. So that's actually quite terrific, actually. And so we can go back to Photoshop's overlay blend, which is doing pretty much the same math. For values that are dead in the middle at 0.5, it basically just passes them through. So terrifically useful, helpful material function. And one that we're using here to improve the contrast of our texture, whatever that texture turns out to be.",
