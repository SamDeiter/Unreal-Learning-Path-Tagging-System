  "text": " Hello and welcome to this next video. In this, we're going to have a look at some of the more advanced ways of creating tasks in order to do stuff within the behavior. Right, so we're back into the engine now and let's create another task. This time, we're going to do is we're going to use our interface slightly. So I am the first thing I'm going to do is. I'll do one from up here again. So under this, I'm going to create a new task. I'm going to use the BT task blueprint base and I'm going to call this BT underscore change color. Okay, and so again, we're back here. And for this, I'm going to do is go override. I'm just going to use receive execute. Now I want to I want to be able to change the color. I'm going to use this node in a number of different places and I'm going to change the different colors. Therefore, what I want to have is a different color. I'm going to call this variable. I'm going to make it instance editable. And on the Boolean, I'm going to be looking for linear color. Now, there are a couple of other colors in here, but make sure you're using linear color. So I'm going to call this color. Okay, now if I drag off of the actor and I type in change color. I'm going to use a message. I'm going to drag in our color and plug it in there. Now I will do the same thing. I'm going to use the same color. I'm going to drag in our color and plug it in there. Now I want to do one final thing, and that is the finish execute. And because I'm using a message, it's not so simple to figure out if this is a success or a failure. So I'm just going to click the default as a success. Again, all this does is it will receive execute and it will send a message via an interface to the actor telling it to change color. And then it's going to finish the execute. Now, let's have a quick look at the interface, because you should have gone over interfaces by now. But what they do is they maintain a means to communicate between different actors. You see, I have BIMPC. If I open this up, you can see down the right hand side, I have a number of different functions. What an interface does is it just defines a method of communicating between the blueprints. And then if what you're sending the message to has that interface applied to it, it will do something on that. Now, this is quite nice for a task because it means that any of the code that we write is isn't class dependent. So this doesn't this doesn't actually know or care what class your your NPC is going to send the task. It's going to send the message regardless. It may not even have this to implement, and then it would do nothing. However, if we have a quick look at our NPC character, you can see that already written some code here. And it's event change color. And we have the interface implemented there. And if we double click on that, it's just changing the tint on a on a material that the character has. So you can see this on construction script. Don't worry too much about that. Just bear in mind that this is it's sending the instruction to change color, and then it's finishing the execute. I'm going to compile and save. Next up, we're going to create one more one more task. And this time I'll do it in a different way. I'm going to right hand click, come up to blueprint task. And under classes, I am going to search for task. And we should see here that we have a BT task blueprint base. And so this is just the other way that I can create a blueprint. I'm going to call this BT underscore change speed. Speed. Double click on that. And on the override again, I'm just going to look for receive execute. And I will need a variable determining the speed as the input. So I will change. I'll create a speed variable, make it a float and make it instance editable. And I'm going to use the interface again to drag off and go change speed message. I'll drag in the speed. That. And again, at the end, I'm going to do P finish execute. I'll mark this as a success. So again, I'm using the interface and the code is all on the porn. But because we're using an interface, they aren't dependent on each other. So you could write a completely different method of changing the color of or by changing the speed and still use exactly the same task in a different in a different behavior tree. Saving compile. And now I'm going to jump back into the baby tree. And I'm going to do a little bit more from this. So for the wonder about the first thing that I want to do is change the speed. Change the speed. And I am going to set this to 200 because we're wondering about we don't really want them running around the place. And then I'm going to drag off and I'm going to do change color. And again, we have a color up here. I'm going to change this to yellow. So that is full one on red one on green, blue zero. So again, these are the ones that I marked as instance editable. And now we have two functions. So if we were to look at this, what it does, it starts off by changing the speed to 200 and changes the color to yellow, finds a random location, moves to it and then waits for one second. Then it will go all the way back to the top and it will repeat the process. Let's save and let's kick that off. So now you can see this is working. Our characters are yellow and they are wandering around accordingly. So they're just moving around slowly to a location. Now press escape there. So that's adding in our extra to our two elements. And what I'd like to do at this point is have a look at how we can visualize what the the behavior trees actually do. So if I was to hit play again, but I'm not going to jump into the character game here. I'm actually going to jump to our baby tree. Now, what we see with the baby tree, we can actually watch this in action. You see at the moment, it's going to the move to and then it will wait for one second. And you can see here we have a drop down and this is going to give us access to all of the other different control. So I can select any of them. They're all pretty much doing the same thing, but it will allow me to watch them as as the game is running. And this is really useful because if you want to figure out why something's getting stuck or what it's doing, you're able to watch them as it's running. You can also see that down here we have the content of the blackboard. So we've not set the player, but we have set the location and the self actor. So that's just a useful method of seeing what the behavior trees doing at any one time. I'm going to come back into here and just stop it. And I think we will stop there for this video. So in the next video, we're going to look at creating a completely different set of actions and show how we would make the decision to change over to a different side of the behavior tree.",
