  "text": " In this video, we're going to talk about the high-level differences between MetaHumans and the Unreal Manikins, and why you may want to choose one over the other for your project. So the first factor to consider is facial capture and whether you need that or not. The MetaHumans come with a fully functional face rig that's ready to go with our Live Link Face app, so you can do full performance capture right out of the box, and all you'll need is a compatible iPhone or iPad. The next thing to think about is the fidelity of these characters. So with the MetaHumans, you're getting realistic deformations, clothing, and a hair system versus the simplified puppet-style character of the Manikin. The footprint is also a factor, so the Manikins have a much lower footprint, both in terms of GPU requirements as well as storage space, and a more simple blueprint setup than MetaHumans. And the MetaHumans, while very high quality, can use up a lot of space and need more GPU power, especially if you're using the highest level of detail versions of the MetaHumans, which can come with up to 8K textures. Compatibility is also something to consider. The Manikins have been around for a while, and so they're compatible with lots of existing assets on the Unreal Marketplace already. If you're prototyping something and you aren't quite sure about the final look and feel of your character, then Manikins might be the way to go for you. Now that being said, both MetaHumans and the Manikin can utilize the built-in control rig within Unreal Engine, and you can also retarget your data onto different characters if necessary. So all in all, both the MetaHumans and the Manikins definitely have their strengths, but it just comes down to weighing out these factors and deciding which one may be right for your particular project.",
