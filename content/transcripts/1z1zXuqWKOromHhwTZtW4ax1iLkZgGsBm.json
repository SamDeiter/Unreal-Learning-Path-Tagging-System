  "text": " So, skylight is only visible in real time, but this unlocks some steps that need to be taken. We should also know that when not using real time capture mode, the skybox or a sphere is expected to have a sky representation, so we must enable in the material settings that is the sky checkbox. Otherwise, its illumination will be double counted and gets them skylight, and it's likely to produce some noise as it won't be important sampled. So also, skybox or sphere shapes should not cast shadows because they can occlude contributions from the skyline and the directional light. So let's go to the project now and let's see how long can we apply these concepts. So right now I'm not working with path tracing and I'm going to go under lead and then in select path tracing. I can see here that whenever I just enable this, everything goes black. So as we read in the previous slide, I'm going to activate the real time capture. And whenever I do this, then I'm getting the black sky contribution. And I get this red sentence and it says, a skylight with real time capture is enabled in the scene. It requires at least a sky atmosphere component, a volumetric cloud component, or a mesh with a material tagged as is sky. Otherwise, it will be black. That actually is what is happening to us. So right now, as we're going to see what happens with the sky atmosphere, actually, we can just place it here with drag and drop and we can put it there. But the thing is that we know that this sky atmosphere is not supported and it's one of the limitations as well as the volumetric clouds. So although we have this, this is not getting the proper quality. So we'll just disable it and delete it. So we're right now going to select the BP sky atmosphere. If we just click in the in the horizon, we can just select it. And now we're going to enable the refresh material here. Sorry, in the sky. We have the real time capture. Then in the sky sphere, instead of going to any of these parameters, I'm going to the sky sphere mesh. And in the material section, I will just double click the material instance dynamic. And here is I won't be able to tackle the sky. So I should go into the parent. So once I'm here, I'm going to scroll down. It should be under the light material section exactly. And we have it here is sky. So I'm going to the detach this window like that. I will be able to see the result immediately. So I scroll down and I find this is sky parameter. So when I activate it right now, I can't see it because it's not applied. So whenever I start applying it, I start seeing all the skies, all the BP sky sphere. And I'm getting this sky contribution. If I deactivate it again, of course, I should apply it. It's black. I should apply it again. And then this is the result. So finally, right now, let's leave this here. And we'll go into the skyline. And we'll just modify this into 1024. So we can get that resolution. We saw how it just everything changed. And this is in order to get like a better, better result for light contribution. So finally, let's see a list of limitations. So as we can see here, some are not supported and other ones are partially supported. So you should know that the system is still evolving. Some of these will be released in the new versions. So we can see that the sky atmosphere and volumetric clouds aren't supported yet, but partially. And it requires a skyline that has real time capture enabled. So we have in the list that it's not just supported, hair strands, spline meshes, cascade particles that actually it's a legacy feature, volumetric fog that it's already in the roadmap, light functions, ion single water shaders model, translucency with depth of field, motion blur, via movie render queue, and decals. So finally, if you have any doubts, or you want any additional information, please refer to this link.",
