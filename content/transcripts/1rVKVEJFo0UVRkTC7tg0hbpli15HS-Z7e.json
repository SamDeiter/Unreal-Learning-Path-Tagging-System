  "text": " Next up, let's talk about some main overhead lighting in part two. So to go over some lighting principles, lighting is one of the easiest ways that can quickly spiral out of control. Whether you have too many lights or just too many at once, the best approach is to just isolate lighting one by one, just constantly check against the scene calibration tools. So for this section, we'll disable lighting except from the skylight, and then we'll create a light stage. So we'll go through this iterative cycle of adding lights, adjusting, disabling, moving to the next light. And our main recommendation here is to use candelas or lumens for intensity units and also make sure your lighting is fully dynamic. So when you're putting your point lights down or your spotlights, for example, you can change between static, stationary or movable. Just make sure they're the movable type. So we'll go ahead and open the neutral map in the classroom walkthrough folder, and then we'll also add the overhead camera lighting. So this is from the light stage in the collections. So I'll jump into the editor and do this, but just make sure you have the neutral map open if you're following along. So back in our editor here, I'm just going to select the level filter. This is the easiest way to find the different maps that you need to work on. I'm going to open neutral and let that load. And with the map open, I'll just remove this levels filter here. I'll go to my light stage and I'll add the white diffuser light that's in the blueprints folder. So I'll just drag and drop that in. And we'll let the shaders build, but I'll just bring this into position here somewhere overhead in the car. And while the shaders build, I'll just go ahead and go through the settings that we want to be setting on this light. So what we'll do, we'll add a rect light to the scene and position it just below this new blueprint that we added. So just from the details panel on the left hand side, we'll add the rect light and then we'll set these properties here. So you could go ahead and note these down if you want, but I'll go through this now in editor. Now that we're back in editor, I'll go ahead to the lighting tab here on the top left in the place actors tab and we'll add a rect light to the scene. And I'll just bring it up here, move it into position. Again, I'm using right mouse button to move around the scene, left mouse button to move backwards and forwards and a combination of right mouse button and left mouse button to just navigate myself into position. I'm hitting spacebar to change the widget. So I'm toggling through spacebar to move this actor into position. We just want to make sure our skylight and directional lights aren't casting a light as well. So you'll see on the skylight, if I scroll down, go to where it says the intensity scale, we've got a 30 right now, so I'm just going to zero that out. And also I'll select my directional light from the outliner as well and just make sure that's, so we have 35 and 300. I just want to zero that stuff out because we don't really want anything affecting the car as we said before. So here's the right light loosely in position here, but from the properties that we wanted before, we first need to make sure our light is movable. So by default it's stationary. Let's set that to movable. Let's set the intensity down here. That's intensity. Right in front of me. Intensity to 12,000. And we also want the radius at 2500. We want the source width at 850. So I'm just typing in the details panel when it's not easy to find certain properties. And again, if you're editing these kinds of things frequently, you could just right click and add to favorites. And as long as you have the favorites toggled, they'll all just be in the same place. So source width is 850. Source height is going to be 240. Band door. The angle is going to be 55. And the length is going to be 40. And I think we're looking pretty good there. So I'm just going to rotate it around. Bring it into position. Make sure the length is okay. So we're looking quite good there. And then the last thing we want to do is duplicate this. So I'm going to move that over to that side. And I'm going to hold down Alt on my keyboard and left mouse drag. And holding Alt will then duplicate that. And that's looking pretty good. Let's move on to the next section now.",
