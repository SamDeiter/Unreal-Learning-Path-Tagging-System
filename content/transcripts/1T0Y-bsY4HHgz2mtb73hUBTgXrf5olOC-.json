  "text": " Next up, I'd like to talk about running Python at runtime. So we talked earlier of how Python isn't a runtime language in the editor. It's mainly used within the editor. Now, that is true. However, there are some oddities about it. Now, you can run it at runtime, but only within the editor. So Python uses the editor utility library, which is stripped out at the level of packaging. However, you can still use this within the editor. I'm going to demonstrate that in a second. It might be worth knowing to you that the plugin is actually a runtime plugin, and therefore could theoretically be manipulated within C++ in order to function. But that is experimental and more experimental than the standard stuff. So just be wary. I wouldn't recommend it. One of the things that Python is used for is performance testing or doing automation at runtime. And we have an automation library, which sits within the Unreal. And this is an example of something that you can run whilst it is being played within the editor. Again, at packaging, this would all be stripped out. And this library, though, is useful if you want to do anything like logging, comparing images, taking screenshots, setting view modes, or changing the scalability options as you run. So we'll jump into the editor and I'll demonstrate how you should do this, because it's not straightforward. So here I am back in the editor. I'm going to try and take a screenshot based on the location you are within the editor. I have a Python script here, which is set to take a screenshot. And it's going to take a timestamp and add that on to the screenshot so that I can save multiple ones. So this is something which is a good example of something that can be run at runtime. And again, that's part of the automation library. I've saved that as takescreenshot.py. And I'm going to open level blueprint. So here we go. Here is the level blueprint. There's some code on it already, but don't worry about that. I'm going to right-hand click and I'm going to create a node. And I'm looking for key Z. So that's a keyboard event Z. Now, this will be triggered when I push a button. But when I push the Z button, to be to be perfectly sure. Now, if I want to run a Python script off of this, if I type in Python, you're going to see that none of our normal Python nodes come up. And that's because the Python nodes are only executable inside of actors which inherit from the editor utilities. So that can be an editor utility widget or an editor utility blueprint, or there's an editor utility actors and so on. Anything you'd use to make a tool. However, what we can do is we can run a C-val. So if I typed in execute, now you've got an option for execute console command. Now, we have the Python side here. However, we can also, if we want to run a Python script, type PY and then the name of the Python script. Which in this case is take screenshot dot PY. I press enter and see that we have our screenshot here. So that is the way that I can run it from the command line. And in that case, if I jump in here, I would be able to place that on an execute command within the screenshot. So if I go file save, now if I push play, I will go full screen. To move around the editor, I'm going to take a close up of this widget. I press Z. You can see that it's taken a screenshot. I'll take one more of the chair over here. And again, it's taken another screenshot. Now, if I come out of this and go back to my screenshot directory, you could see that we now have those two screenshots that we've created. And that brings us to the end of this short video on running Python at runtime. I'll catch you in the next one.",
