  "text": " Hello everyone, my name is Martin Cousins. I'm going to be an instructor for today and we're looking into Introduction to Unreal Engine for Programmers for Unreal 5.5. Brief kind of summary of the itinerary for today. First off we're going to start looking at project compilation and the kind of different configurations and deployments we can have. Then we're going to talk a little bit about modules which are kind of the key building blocks in a kind of code structure for how Unreal Engine puts a project together and just generally how an Unreal Engine project is structured. Then we're going to look a little bit at the Unreal Build and Header tool which are really important independent programs that are executed as part of either making a build of your project for an editor or creating a packaged version of your game. Then we're going to talk a little bit about kind of the in-engine minutiae of things like the Unreal reflection system, then on to how components and actors are used in Unreal, what those ideas even mean, how they're used, what you can do with them. Then we're going to go a bit into Unreal's implementation of memory management and garbage collection and move on to the life cycles of objects and actors and things to be aware of when you're programming systems that are using these things. And last off we're going to finish off talking a little bit about blueprints which as we'll get to later is worth highlighting that it is definitely not something that coders don't need to be aware of.",
