  "text": " Okay, let's begin to wrap things up with a few final recommendations, and we'll begin with project organization. As you can see in this slide here, there are levels and sublevels that allow for better organization and collaborative compartmentalization. So your environment or your persistent level will contain anything that is universally shared within the entire project. Project sets, environments, or discipline-specific setups can live on their own sublevels, and to clarify, when I'm talking about levels I'm referring to maps or worlds, I do not mean level sequences. There is a difference between these two assets. Levels get organized into sublevels and live under your persistent level depending on what is actually needed for your project or department. For example, your main lighting setup should live on your persistent level as it will be utilized by the entire project or production. Any level sequence-specific lighting setups should live in a SequencerLightingComp sublevel so that anything specific to a level sequence that is spawnable can be connected to that specific lighting sublevel. That way it can get called in and out without affecting the persistent level and causing problems between users working with that persistent level by having the sequencer-specific lighting turn on or off when that lighting sublevel is called into action. Now another actor class that has a profound impact on setting up action in Unreal Engine is the use of subscene tracks. A subscene essentially references an existing level sequence for the express purpose of layering multiple actions together. This type of organization allows you to create departmentalized level sequence organization so that teams of artists can work together in real time to construct distinct portions of the action based on department or discipline, and that can be utilized in conjunction with sublevel organization. Just as we discussed for the lighting scenarios, cinematography can do this for cine cameras, character animation can have its own subscene so all your characters and animations can live on an animation-specific sublevel as well. Level blueprints or level sequence blueprints, level sequence-specific effects, anything that could be spawnable or triggered can also live on a sublevel under the persistent level and also be organized in sequencer through subscenes. One thing to note is that while subscene organization works well for most departmental organization, it does not work with the storyboarding tools at this time. Attempting to use subscene for storyboard organization will cause the engine to crash. Additionally, you can also create level visibility tracks in sequencer that allows you to turn on and off the visibility of the asset in each of the sublevels so that they don't always have to be active. Finally, I want to emphasize how important project organization is. Without it, things can get really messy very fast, so I highly recommend creating nested folders and folder structures inside your content browser and inside your outliner to maintain project organization as you work. Now, productions will vary depending on your studio needs, but again, it is highly recommended that as a general rule of thumb, you create nested folder structures in your content browser and outliner to maintain overall studio project organization. Now that's it for this section. In our next section, we will continue with more of our final recommendations.",
