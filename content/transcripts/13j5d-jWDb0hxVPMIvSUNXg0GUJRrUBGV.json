  "text": " So let's talk about some texture optimization pipelines here. Again we're in the project settings window so just go to edit project settings and in the rendering tab we can enable virtual texture support. So what does enabling virtual texture support do? So we can convert things to a virtual texture and we can essentially decide how the streaming method is affected. So in your texture you can change the sampler type to a virtual color and you'll see in the content browser you'll have an icon there that says VT just to show you that you've changed this to a virtual texture. And so talking about texture creation and whether we are streaming, not streaming, virtually you'll see the three different boxes that we have here and you'll see that we've imported the texture, a 1024, at the bottom one it's a 1000 by 1000, but you can essentially see the texture properties by just double clicking the texture in your content browser and you'll see that by changing the method whether it's streamed or virtually streamed or not streamed this has an impact on how this resource is used and the size that it is used at and you can see that the resource size is massively different depending on how the texture is then streamed. So if you're not streaming any textures for example that resource size is going to be much higher than if you're trying to stream it at runtime and then even lower if you virtually stream the texture. So again this depends on your project requirements and what kind of output you need and the visual fidelity of the textures that you need but just thinking about how you're streaming the textures can have a big impact on the resource size of that specific texture. So when we talk about MIP mapping as well, dependent on the size and the use of the texture, if you're MIP mapping the textures, so say we've got a 1496 texture and you're seeing it close up and everything is nice and crisp and your texture looks great but then if you want to MIP map it, Unreal will take some affordances so if you then see a distance it will optimize the texture so that it will reduce in quality the further away that you are for example. So going from 1496 to 512 at a distance we're getting a lower fidelity technically out of the texture. However, because it's further away it's less perceivable to the eye at a further distance. So MIP mapping can really help when you're talking about resource size and imagine if we weren't MIP mapping and we had 1496 textures and they were just on every asset in the game and we weren't MIP mapping therefore we weren't trying to optimize the texture and everything was being rendered at its full output then you're going to have some performance issues and maybe you want that, maybe you want the crispest highest quality and you're running on the highest end of hardware and you want to keep everything preserved. Again it's the trade off and the push and pull between the desired platform and what project is for a real time game that's on a console for example will have very different requirements than a Atfiz project running on a high end PC which is a small contained scene for example. So again there are trade offs but MIP mapping is something to consider there and we can see with the different view modes with MIP mapping turned on you see we're getting this fall off towards the horizon line whereas the MIP mapping when it's turned off Unreal is still trying to render it and it starts to feel a little bit noisy, it's still maintaining its compression there and it's trying to render but you can see the difference more towards the horizon line as you see MIP mapping turned on between on and off there. And this is just a good way to visualize the texture resolution and what's going on with the MIP mapping here so just using this render mode will help kind of visualize the resources and where they are being spent in your scene and Unreal comes with a lot of good texture optimization view modes which are good to enable and disable depending on what you're trying to see but this is just a good visual representation of that.",
