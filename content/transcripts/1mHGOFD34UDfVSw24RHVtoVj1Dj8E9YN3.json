  "text": " Hello, and welcome to the Epic Games Collaboration Tools training for MegaReview. My name is Kevin Miller and I am an instructor for Epic Games. Now a quick reminder that this is an internal training and it is not to be shared outside of Epic Games. We will start though with a brief introduction to MegaReview and then run through the user interface demonstrating each section as we go. Finally, this short walkthrough will end with some support resources that you can use if you run into any problems while using MegaReview. So let's get started. For users that are just starting out with this tool, you're probably wondering, what is MegaReview? Well, MegaReview is Epic Games' collaborative media review tool that allows users to browse, playback and annotate media in dailies in real time. Primarily, we will be using the web-based version of this tool, but MegaReview does offer integration with ShockGrid for use as the backend. This allows users to select and view the dailies of projects already in ShockGrid, draw directly on media frames and leave annotated notes, jump from the MegaReview entry directly to the reference ShockGrid entity, browse and create playlists, search for dailies by name, author, status, where it currently sits in the pipeline and save those searches for later. However, the main use of this tool is for users to collaborate with each other in sync sessions for media review. To do that, you'll need to know your way around. So let's explore the user interface and see what tools are currently available in MegaReview. As I take you through the user interface, I'm going to break it down into two parts, and I'll start with the top bar. For users just starting out with MegaReview, a list of projects will be assigned to you through your organization. If you don't see a list of projects, you can use the refresh button in the upper left-hand corner to log back into MegaReview through the authentication system. If you still don't see your project to which you should have been assigned, you can request access to that MegaReview project through SailPoint. Once approved, just refresh and select your project to open up the MegaReview interface. Now, when MegaReview first opens up, you will see that one of the view options is active. And if you've already been in MegaReview, you will start out with the last view you set up. So the navigation tree in the upper left-hand corner could be active. And your preferred view could also be active. So for me, the list view is active. But I'm going to walk you through here the gallery view, which can be adjusted by sliding in and out, or the list view, which you can also move to adjust and view more information. Now as I want to keep things clean and simple, I'm going to go ahead and leave this in my list view. And from here, I want to upload a new piece of media. But before I do that, I'm going to move up over to the right-hand corner and activate the full screen option. So I can also exit using the full screen button, or you'll see this X pop up. But the reason I wanted to make full screen active is because uploading media will also exit the full screen. And if I move here to upload a new version of media, you'll see me get kicked out and the upload media window open. From here, I'm going to choose a new piece of media to upload. And for that, I'm going to select the Spider Shock UV set. Once that's done, I hit open and I wait for it to transcode. Once the file is successfully uploaded, then I'm going to need to organize it into my playlist. Now one thing to note is that my Spider Shock playlist is only for concept. And inside there, I have my model or my asset as well. By using the three dots here, I can remove from playlist. If I have permissions, I can delete the media and keep things organized as well. But I'm just going to remove this from the playlist. Now I'm going to need a new playlist for that to go into. So I'm going to go ahead and use the playlist button to add a new playlist. And for that, I'm going to type 04 asset model S. I'm going to go ahead and create that. Now I have my Spider Shock color selected, but that's not the asset I want to work with. So I'm going to go ahead and close this. If I move into my asset model, you'll notice I didn't name this fully. So I'm going to use these three dots. I'm going to use the option to rename this to model Spider Shock. Now I've saved this and I want to move assets in here. But those assets aren't in other playlists. They're located in my most recent section. I'm going to go ahead and select first my model. And I'm going to add this to my playlist, select my asset model Spider Shock playlist folder, and link it. I'm going to do the same with my UV asset. Hit that button, select my Spider Shock model, and apply that link as well. That way, I can see that in my playlist, both of those assets are active. Now that my playlists are organized and named correctly, I'm ready to start a media sync review session. Though I have a few decisions to make before I do that. I can start a session using the sync button, copy this link to this specific session, and share it with others for a real time session, or activate my notes and create annotations and then share this sync for those before I start. While inside my sync, I can pause or continue the sync. I can also leave the sync with two options, leaving it and using the URL to reaccess that link, or end the sync for all users. For this media sync multi-user session, I'm connected through my tower and my laptop, but I'm also joined by Sean Spitzer, a senior instructor here at Epic Games and the lead on the ILT unified content example. Sean is currently driving the timeline using the play button to view the entire turntable video for the MiS-MEC robot mode. As the turntable moves, I've identified an area that needs revision or completion. As Sean and I are in a zoom meeting, I take over. I create a set playback range using the middle mouse and drag button. And then I highlight the shoulder area with the laser pointer, which is not permanent. Sean acknowledges the revision point. He steps between frames before choosing one, and then flips the image horizontally as is his preference when working on notation. Sean then uses the pen and eraser tools to draw over the joint, showing what he wants for revision. As Sean does this drawing, I'm going to zoom in and look at what he's actually doing with the zoom in and zoom out buttons. While Sean creates this joint, the draw over is not affected by my zooming in. Once completed with his revision, Sean types up an annotation note. Now on my laptop, I moved frame one and type up an additional note for this session. Now I'm ready to download the frame so that I have notes that I need for the revision. To do that, I move up to the frame that we were working on, move to the download version, and do download current frame with sketches. Once the download is complete, I'm ready to end the sync for everyone as our multi-user review session has been completed. Now before we wrap up the mega review training, I want to leave users with a few resources to help with growing accustomed to this new tool set. Starting with everyone's favorite, the current hotkeys. Beginning with the grave accent key in the navigation toggle set, running through the annotation controls or command key options, depending on your operating system. And finishing with the playback options, I want to note that additional hotkeys will be introduced in future updates. Next are a few helpful links, starting with the Slack channel, where users will find additional resources and links to the sale point where you can get started, and the user guide documentation as linked here. One last thing to note is that if users encounter an error where the uploaded media fails to transcode, it is recommended to contact support through the Slack channel. That's it for the Epic Games Collaboration Tools training for mega review. I hope this helps get things started, and thank you for your time.",
