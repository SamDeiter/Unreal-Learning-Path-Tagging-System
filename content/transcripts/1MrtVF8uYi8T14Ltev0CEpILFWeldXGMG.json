  "text": " Let's talk about some of the core fundamentals of Sequencer. So the first question is, what is a Sequencer? What is Sequencer? So Sequencer is a non-liter editing tool inside of Unreal that allows us to assemble content, whether it's content that's currently in our game or on our map, or to be able to create spawnable assets, which we'll talk about here in just a second. We can add audio. We can add camera cuts. We essentially can create, for lack of better terms, a complete feature film within the editor itself without ever having to go outside and use any other DCC programs. Additionally, as it relates to games, we can actually use Sequencer to create in-game cutscenes. We can use it for loading screens. We can use it for player showcases. Again, Sequencer is not just about creating film, but basically allows us to assemble all of these components in a, for lack of better terms, a pre-scripted way to get the visual results that we want. Now, one thing to cover is that we're going to be talking about terminology about film, sequence, shots, nested sequences, master sequences, et cetera. Fundamentally, all of these are going to be using a sequence from inside of the editor. And it's important to understand that a sequence, you don't have to have a different type of Sequencer, a different type of piece of content to create these. We're going to be using the same sequence. And essentially, it's just a container. Really, the important part to remember is how you use that container that really changes its function, which again, is going to allow us to create shots, sequences, graduated sequences, master sequences, and then finally, everything propagated up into what we'll just effectively call our film. A couple pieces of terminology that you need to understand when it comes to Sequencer is we can target content that's already in our map. So for example, if we have certain interactable components or we have certain NPCs characters, we will call those possessibles. And essentially, it just allows us to target whatever those assets are. And inside of our Sequencer, make changes, whether it's translation, attribute changes, et cetera. Fundamentally speaking, those are already in our world. Which brings us to our second type, which is a Spawnable. Spawnable assets really only exist inside of the level sequence. And we know that identified by this lightning bolt icon. So essentially, what we could do is we could have our world that's built for our game that our player is playing through. And we have an in-game cut scene. We'll actually build here in just a little bit. And in that cut scene, we may have an NPC that exists only for that cut scene. So rather than have that character just floating somewhere in the world, during our sequence, during playback, we can have that object spawn in. And then when the sequence is done, unload and spawn out.",
