  "text": " At this point in your workflow, you should have a project created again, launched from the epic launcher, we're able to create a new project, whether it's based on a template, or just a blank one. So the editor should be running. And now we want to ingest content into our project. So that's what we're going to talk about now. So there's a couple things to keep in mind when it comes to adding assets to your project. Not only can we import our own custom content, but we can actually import content from, say for example, starter packs that ship with the engine, marketplace content, or even using tools like the Quixel library, all of which are available to you to use for commercial use. Additionally, like I had mentioned, we can import our own custom assets, we can do that with FBX files, which is the common file format that we'll use to ingest most of our content when it deals with things like static meshes, skeletal meshes, etc. We can also use Datasmith to import our files as well. Now something that might be a little bit of a misconception is Datasmith is not just useful for things like architectural visualizations. If you think about it more as like a file format container, it contains a lot of powerful tools. And in fact, when it comes to automotive projects, the Datasmith plug in the Datasmith exporter is extremely valuable because if you think about dependencies like, you know, various pivot points that aren't perfectly perpendicular or multiple dependencies where some parts are attached to certain others, Datasmith makes that process extremely easy. We'll also talk about the static mesh editor as well. Now before we get too far, again, the general assumption is now that you have your project open, that you'll want to know a little bit of how to move around inside of the viewport. So I'll keep this up for you to reference. But in general, the most important thing we're going to use here is this right mouse click WASD. So if you hold down right mouse in your editor and move your keys, it should move around. In fact, if I jump back to our project, I'm going to hold down my right mouse button, you can see if I move my mouse around, I can look around and as soon as I press W, I'll move forward, press S to move backwards, D to move side and A to move side to side as well. So I can do this and I can just as I move my mouse around kind of fly around it like I'm hovering a vehicle. All right, perfect. All right, so when it comes to our content, we can use readily available content from, for example, the marketplace, you can access this via a web browser or you can also access it through your Epic Games launcher. There's a tab at the top called marketplace. And with this you can find a bunch of curated content that's available to you. In fact, there are some things that are also free. The automotive material pack, which I highly recommend you take a look into, is provided for free by Epic and has some very high quality, very realistic calibrated materials perfect for working with automotive projects. All you need to do is just acquire that and then add it to your project, at which point when you press add to project, you select your project, I jump back to the editor, you'll see that'll add it inside of your content folder. So here is that automotive materials pack. And if we scroll through here, you see that we have various different things included with that. And again, all of this is available for use for commercial use. We have other tools as well, like the Quixel library. So if you want to also inject very high quality, very professional assets, absolutely you can use this. In fact, if you use your Epic Games account, all of that content is provided free to you. Also want to take a quick note about migrating assets. So it is entirely possible that you can migrate assets from one project to another. However, you need to be mindful of the project folder structure. And what I mean by that is if you notice here, I have this automotive materials, so capital A, capital M, and then S for materials inside of my content folder. Now the general assumption would be that if I'm going to copy this over to another project, I need to make sure that I'm actually copying that folder from the content to the content folder of the other project, or we can use a tool that's right click migrate. And when you click migrate, it will run through all of the asset dependencies, hit OK, it'll pop open the window, and then you select the project, just the root folder of that content. And then you can migrate it and will automatically move everything that you need to that. Again, the key point here is just keep in mind that when you migrate assets, there is a hard link between where those files are located in the project you're migrating from that needs to match the project you're migrating to. All right, so just a couple things to keep in mind when it comes to exporting your content from your DCC applications. So you need to make sure that you use descriptive names for your objects and your materials. This makes it extremely handy, especially when you're reconnecting materials or understanding what component is what. Make sure you're seen as well organized and when possible combine meshes together. Now one thing you can do when you're importing assets, especially with the FBX import options, is you can choose to combine your meshes. So you could keep them separate and combine them when you bring it into the engine. However, the general recommendation is that you pre combine them before they come out to make life a little bit easier for you. Also make sure that your meshes are clean and consistent with proper UVs. As you'll find out later, the engine can also help to generate some of these UVs. But of course, if you have that bad data coming in, it's not going to be as easy to get the best results possible. So again, make sure your measures are clean, consistent with proper UVs. Also pay attention to your objects that have been scaled, especially in any non uniform way. It's important that you reset your scale before exporting your assets and bringing them into Unreal. Also make sure that you keep your scene as close to the origin as possible, which is 000. Unreal will recognize the pivot point location of your assets. But of course, if they're really far away, you will actually see them offset when you go to add them to your scene. When it comes to working with your content, especially for automotive projects, you really have two major options to export your content and import it into the editor. And that is going to be using FBX or Datasmith. Now FBX is great for the majority of your workflow. But if you're going to use your FBX exporter, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. First, you need to make sure that your system units are consistent as you go through about your FBX workflow. Make sure if you're going to try to match the Unreal units using centimeters is the best approach. If you don't use centimeters, just be mindful of the conversion that you will need to make sure that it does match. Also make sure your objects are centered in the world and their pivot points are set to 000. If you decide to use Datasmith, now Datasmith is a very powerful tool that is not just only beneficial to things like architectural visualization, but it is an extremely powerful import export feature. If you're going to use Datasmith, you need to make sure that you have the data exporter plugin for your DCC apps of choice. And there are quite a few. It does support some CAD formats natively and works really well. Just simply search for Unreal Engine Datasmith and you should be able to access the plugins webpage and download the appropriate export. When you're using Datasmith, you don't need to necessarily worry about your DCC scene units because Datasmith will take care of that conversion. One of the other powerful things about Datasmith is that it reads and imports CAD formats natively and it also works extremely well with fully assembled scenes and large data sets. Additionally, Datasmith can export your full scenes or your partial ones. And at any point in time after the Datasmith object has been imported into Unreal Engine, you can reimport that should anything change within your DCC app. I should make note too that you can still use that same workflow with FBX. But again, just keeping in mind that Datasmith gives you a lot more robust functionality. All right, let's go ahead and move on to our next section.",
