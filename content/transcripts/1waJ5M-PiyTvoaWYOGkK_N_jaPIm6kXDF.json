Understanding these functions will set us up with a good knowledge base for us to build UI elements. On the left we've got screenshots of the blueprint versions of some of these key functions, whilst on the right we've got screenshots of the code functions that we'd find inside user widget. Firstly, we've got construct, and this will be called when the UI has been added to the viewport, and we can think of this as our begin play function that we'd usually see when working with actors and components. From there, we've got tick, and this behaves exactly as you'd expect. This function will be called regularly and consistently, with each frame being the default. Finally, we've got destruct, and this will be called when the UI is removed from the viewport or the parent. We can think of this as our end play function that we'd usually see when working with actors or components. Moving on, we've got pre-construct. This function will be called as our widget is created the same as construct, however, the function will be called in both the game and editor. The purpose of this function is purely for cosmetic updates that use locally owned data, so you can't safely access the game at this point. Lastly, we've got mouse button down and mouse button up. These functions are called from the widget system to notify that the mouse button has been pressed or released within the bones of this widget, and we typically use these functions to drive drag and drop functionality.",
