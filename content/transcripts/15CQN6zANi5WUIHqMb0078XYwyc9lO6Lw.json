  "text": " In today's class, we're going to do a quick start, your first project in Unreal Engine, specifically from an automotive perspective. What we're going to cover today are the basics of UE4, so how you can install and run the engine from the Epic Games launcher. We'll talk about setting up projects based on pre-built templates, as well as starting from blank projects. We'll also talk about the UI and navigating around inside of the editor, and then we'll also step through placing objects into our scene. We'll then move on to talking about importing data, whether that's your own custom content or content that's been acquired through the Unreal Marketplace. And then finally, we'll step through lighting the materials towards the end of this class that help you get familiar with working inside of Unreal. Now, before we jump into the project, I want to cover a couple other additional resources that are available to you. The two that I'm going to cover are LMS, which is the Learning Management System, as well as the Epic Games Launcher. Now, LMS is a system that has been set up that's completely free. Log in with your Epic ID, and you will have access to a number of training resources. In addition to these videos that are posted there, you also have things like guided learning paths, which are kind of curated segments where different videos, different modules are pulled together based on production workflows. And are extremely helpful. Here you can learn from industry experts on different methodologies, different practices, and how to, in general, use the engine and grow your skills. In addition, you can earn achievements. You can take small little tests, little quizzes in here, just to reinforce your knowledge of the principles being taught in there. Secondly, we also have the Epic Games Launcher, which is not only good for installing and accessing your engine and your projects, but there are other tabs in here as well, including the Learn tab, which will have various different projects and workflows available to you, again, completely free, to be able to see how industry experts set up projects, how they work with different workflows, as well as content that you can download, including small modules or even full projects ready to ship. You also have the ability to download Marketplace content, which is great and useful not only for just adding content to your projects, but you can also use it as an opportunity to reverse engineer how these different setups were created, which should help and further aid in your process of creating content, packaging your projects, and ultimately creating your final product. Thank you.",
