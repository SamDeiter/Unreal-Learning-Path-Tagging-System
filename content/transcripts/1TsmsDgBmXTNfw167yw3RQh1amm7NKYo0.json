  "text": " Before we can start to paint on our landscape, we're going to need to actually set up a special material for our landscape. And to do this, we're going to create a new landscape, and then we're going to use this special node called a landscape layer blend. And we have that on the screen in front of us. What this node allows us to do is it allows us to specify which landscape layer will be represented by which texture or which color. So in our particular case, we're going to make a new landscape layer blend for and then give it a dirt, a rock and a grass layer. We're then going to take a just standard color and put that in and change that color to represent our dirt, our rock and our grass. So let's pop over to the editor. And first things first, we're going to hit control space on our keyboard to bring up our content browser. Then I'm just going to right click and go into our material. We're going to call this M-A-T underscore and escape. And then we're going to double click on this to open it up. Now with this open, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to right click in here and look for our landscape. And right here we have our landscape layer blends. We're going to go ahead and click on that. Now by default, this is not going to have any information in it, and that's okay. We're going to add that information by selecting it. And then over in the details panel, we're going to press this add element to array once, twice and three times. We're then going to expand each index and give it a name. So we're going to call this one, let's say rock. Then we're going to go dirt and then we're going to go grass. All right. So what we can do now is we're going to take the end of our landscape layer blend and we're going to plug that into our base color. Then what we're going to do is we're going to right click and look for a vector parameter. And the reason we're going to use vector parameters is landscapes can get quite big in terms of instruction counts for their materials. And this can take a really long time to compile. To make things a little bit quicker and easier to adjust using these vector parameters and then using a material instance on top of our landscape is going to make it a lot easier for us to see those results in real time instead of having to wait for recompilation. So we're going to call this fourth one rock. And let me just delete that comment there and do this one more time. So there we go. Rock. And then I'm going to plug that into our layer rock. Then I'm going to double click on it and select kind of like a grayish color here. Something kind of dark for our rock there. Right. And then I'm going to go click on it and duplicate. Then I'm going to call this next one dirt. We're going to give it some type of brownish color. Go maybe a little bit more in the red and we're going to plug that into our dirt. And then last but not least we're going to duplicate. We're going to call this last one rats. And then we're going to change this to a greenish type color and then just plug that in like so. Let's go ahead and apply and save our material. Now we're not done yet but the next thing that we're going to do is we are going to add a normal map setup to this. So it's going to be very similar but instead of using colors we are going to use textures in this case. And we're also going to add a landscape chords and a multiply with a scalar parameter. And this is going to allow us to increase or decrease the size of these normal maps inside of our material instance. And this is really good because again you when you're building a material you don't necessarily know how it's going to use. So you want to give that material lots of options. So let's go ahead and add those options now by coming back into the editor. And again I can take this landscape layer blend and I can right click on this and duplicate it. And then just plug this right into our normal right here. And this is going to help save a little bit of time. All right so let's go ahead and look for our landscape our layer coordinates right there. All right and then we're going to look for a multiply. Another math we have our multiply. Right so right now we're going to connect the output of our landscape layer chords to the input on the A of the multiply. And then what we're going to do is we're going to look for a we want a constant parameter. And let's just do let's just do it this way. We'll grab a constant here and we're going to give this a default value of one. But so we can make this editable inside of our material instance I'm going to right click on this convert to parameter and we're going to call this normal under four. And let me make sure I'm actually clicked in it. There we go. And we're going to plug that right into our multiply there. So last but not least we need to add some texture samplers so that we actually have normal maps to sample. So let's look for a texture and we're going to grab a texture sample parameter 2D. And we're going to call this fourth one rock underscore in. So rock normal. And then what I'm going to do first is I'm going to come down here to the default texture to look for an underscore in. And then we're just going to select something. Let's look for there we go slate rock. So we have our normal map and then all we need to do is connect our multiply to our UVs and then connect this to the input on our rock layer. And I'm going to duplicate this. So we're going to duplicate this. Put it down and connect like so. We're going to call this one. Dirt underscore normal. There we go. Then we're going to plug that into our layer dirt. And we're going to change this to let's see if we have some type of dirt in here. No no dirt. So let's go ahead and just do underscore in so we can look for some normals here. And we'll give this let's see here. DTL rocky. There we go. And then one more time right click and duplicate. And we're going to call this one grass. So grass and then connect like so. And then we're also going to I believe there is actually a grass normal map in here. There we go. Yep. Grab this grass one and then we'll plug this in like so. Once we have finished this, all we have to do is press apply and save. And now we are ready to actually use this as a paintable material inside of our landscape.",
