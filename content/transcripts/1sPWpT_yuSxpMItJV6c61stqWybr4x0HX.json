  "text": " Now that we have our tools set up, now let's look at how we might begin the storyboarding process inside of Unreal Engine. So let's look at how we create this first storyboard. So to get started, we want to create a board. So we have this drop down option here, and we want to start storyboarding. Again, if you can't see these options, it may be because you've not got the correct plugins enabled. So you just want to restart your editor again if your plugins aren't there, and then select start storyboarding to create a new board sequence asset. So additionally, we can also import the image sequences directly into Unreal, but for this purpose, we're just going to drop down from the cinematic and start storyboarding. So when starting out with a new board sequence, there are a few settings you want to change here that can modify, and then once you get familiar with those, you can dial them in for whatever you would like for your given project. So we want to adjust the root board for your project, so the name and path, you want to set those into the desired locations, and then in the naming convention tab, you have the global settings here, and then also the board naming convention fields. So however you would like to set those up for your project's needs, you can use those. And then we also have the shot plane and the camera naming within these different headings here, and then starting out, it is okay to leave these as defaults, but as you get more familiar with these tools, you'll be able to dial them into exactly what you need. So you have a couple more options here in the sequence and sequencer tabs if you do want to update any of these settings here.",
