  "text": " So, to add some camera movement to our rail, let's scroll down, let's get our camera here, and generally because we're moving along a rail, now I'm looking through the lens here, because we're moving along a rail, we generally wouldn't want the location to be keyed. So I'm going to drop the transform down, I'm going to right click on location, I'm going to click delete, I'm also going to delete the scale, because we never really manipulate the scale for cameras, it doesn't make too much sense to do that. So just to clean things up, I'm just going to get rid of the scale, we definitely want the rotation in this instance. So let's look at where we cut to on the rail, and again I think on the rail I'm just going to add this linear movement whilst I'm here, completely up to your personal preference, but it just felt a bit weird going from one cut to another, and I was lerping into the next shot rather than it keeping consistent movement. So just a personal preference, you feel free to do whatever you would like for your scene. Mainly we're looking for the camera though. So we're looking here, and I think what would be cool is if we start focusing on this performance here, and I think at this point one thing I noticed as I was going through the shot is it'd be nice to do a little bit of a push in on this runner. Completely accidental, but when we're setting up these shots, sometimes you look for these interesting blocking opportunities. So I'd like to push in on that runner once I've looked at these people here. So I'm going to set my rotation to these people here. I'm going to frame it up a little bit, like, I'm not sure. Maybe that's okay. So I'm going to hit rotation there. Again I'm looking through my camera, I'm going to set the rotation. Now our focus is way out at the moment as well, so we're going to click on our camera in our scene, make sure we have our focus setting selected, and we're going to set our focus. Again, I just set it to an arbitrary number for now, I then turn on my focus plane and I just get a feel for where we're at in the scene. That looks kind of good. Again, we'll hit add the key. It's also useful to note that we have these little sequencer keys here. You can add a keyframe for this property and you'll notice that there's no current key for the focus. If I add this here, it adds there. I generally prefer to do it within this box. I think for some reason, just when I click over here or my eyesight is on the right hand side, then I have to go back to the left to check that I actually added the key correctly. I tend to do all my stuff in the real estate of the sequencer. Complete personal preference. So let's look at this shot. I'm going to hold coming around here on these people dancing. So I'm going to try and keep this person in shot. I'm going to add rotation again. I've slipped out of focus now as well. So I'm going to try and bring this person back in focus. It's kind of nice to have the background character out of focus. Let's just check that focus coming through here as well. In focus. They slip out of focus a little bit, so I'm just going to track the focus again. Got that there. A little bit out of focus. That's generally okay. So yeah, I'm okay with that. And then what we're going to do is we're going to cut, well we're not going to cut, but we're going to pan over now to our runner. So let's say we've got movement here. So we hit rotation there. And let's just make sure we've now got, that's probably a bit too quick, so I'm going to drag this key out. And again, now it's just getting down to flavor and how you want to edit it. And we kind of pan over. Maybe want to frame this up a little bit nicer as well. Sometimes it's nice to overshoot and then dial it in a little bit. And the thing that I was thinking about here is that I actually want to change it from a 50 mil maybe to then push into more like a 30. So I'm actually going to set custom now. And the lens setting that I want to do is the minimal focus. I'm going to call it 30. And so I've gone from 50, maybe even I want to go to 80 actually. Let's go to 80 or an 85 just to match the frame that we had before or even maybe we'll try 105. Yeah, 105 looks pretty good actually. So our min focus will be 50. Again, this is completely optional. And then the max is going to be 105 just so we can dial this in. So 50 is where we're starting the frame from. So I'm going to click this. Current focal length here is going to be 50. So I'm just going to hit 50 and that takes us back to our original frame. I'm just going to make sure I add a key here. I'm going to make sure I add a key there, there. So just before I cut across, so there I'm going to hit 50 as well. So I'm going to add a key. So that's 50. And then as I dial it back in, as we're following, maybe I push in now to 105. Let's just see how this looks. So we're watching the performance. Little bit heavy. So again, we probably want to draw that out for a little bit longer. And let's just add some focus in here as well. So I'm clicking. I rack over here. So I probably want a focus still being set there. But then when we hit the character, we want to drag out the focus. And again, I'm just repeating the same actions that we've previously been doing, but just trying to dial this in. So again, just pushing. Let's look at this here. That's easing a little bit more. So that's much nicer than we had before anyway. And then I'm just going to select this key so I know where we hit the end beat. Let's just push that focus there. And now let's see how our whole shot in composition is looking. So I'm just going to unlock here. I'm going to rewind back to the start of the scene. I've still got a fog focus plane enabled. So let's disable that first. So I'm going to untick that. Now let's look through the first camera. Let's see what we've got. So we've got our panning shot. We pan over to a character in the background. We rack focus. We then transition to a rail shot and a performance. And then we push in a little bit heavy on that last key there just for a second. But yeah, that's pretty nice. Now let's do a little bit of a fade just to show you that happening. And then we'll move on to a crane pan, shall we say. So in our sequencer, we want to add a track. We'll go to fade. And we've added a fade track now. I like to drag this fade track all the way up to the top. So I'm going to left click and just drag upwards. And I'm just going to mouse wheel up to the very top. Fade track is for me always better at the top just so we can align it. And I'm going to drag along to the sequencer here. I'm going to add a new key. I'm going to drag it along there. And maybe as we hit the end of the performance there, I'm going to select this and hit 1. So now we're essentially fading to black. So when we come in here, we're pushing in. Maybe even we could start fading to black a little bit sooner actually. You know, just bringing it out. And again, complete personal preference at that point. Feels pretty good. We've got camera cuts in there. We've got panning shot. We've got a rail shot. Overall, quite happy with the scene. So now let's add a camera panning shot maybe to establish our scene.",
