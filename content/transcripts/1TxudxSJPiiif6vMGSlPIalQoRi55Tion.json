  "text": " Hello and welcome to the second video in the importing asset section. In this we will be importing a file from an FBX and we will be looking at how you'd go about migrating something from one project to another. Right, let's look at importing into a project via a file. For this we are going to use an FBX. This is a common format that you would be able to output from something like Maya or Blender. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start off by opening a new folder. So I'm going to call this robot. It's going to be importing a skeletal mesh for one of our assets. Now I've got a couple of different options but the one I'm going to use here is the import. If I push import it's immediately going to jump me into the file explorer asking me to find where the files are to be imported. Now you're only going to be able to see in this files which Unreal understands as important. You can see in this directory all I have is three PNGs. If I was to select one of these it would import it as a texture and a SK underscore bot which is a 3D object and is of type FBX. FBX is supported by default. However, there are other versions with plugins you can get the engine to work with. So I'm now going to select OK and it's going to bring me up a huge amount of options. And now I know that these options work so I'm not going to mess around with them but you can probably find stuff that would work with your pipeline. So I'm just going to hit import. See importing down here and then suddenly we've got everything in already. Now if I was to drag in our little character here you can see that it's in the engine. Alright I'm going to push the G button I mentioned this year but that puts us in game mode and that will turn off any of the widgets that we have so you can see how something would look when it's in game mode. And that is working great. I can even open up the material and see that all of the textures and stuff are connected to the product. So it really is quite straightforward as long as you're using some of the default ones. It's just a question of finding the file and importing them. You may find that the preparation for a clean import is a little bit harder especially when it comes to materials because different engines work with materials in different works. We will touch on that as we go on. You'll also find that you can import animations in the same way and apply them to specific skeletal methods. So that really is the basics of importing from a file. Okay let's talk about migration. So that is moving elements from one project to another. Now at the moment I've jumped into another project here and I have a mesh from our Quixel collection and this is a tree and what I want to do is move that into the project that we are working. This is how I would go about that. First thing I would do is go right-hand click and under asset actions I would select migrate. It asks me to save the level. What it's going to do then is it's going to go away and find all of the different dependencies which would be required in order to get this model to work in the new project. And it's to be noted I'm on the same version of the engine which makes this a lot easier, makes everything compliant. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go okay. And then I'm going to the first project and the content directory. I'm going to select that. Now we're looking to move things into a content directory because otherwise it isn't going to all of the references root from a content directory. So in this case it needs to be in the content. And select the folder. Now it's going to go away and migrate all those different assets and migrate to the and validate them. So here we are back in our original project. And you can now see that we have this asset directory and within the meshes we have mytree. I drag this in and take a second for it to be compiled. Hey presto, the tree is now in the new project along with all of its dependencies. Okay and with that it brings us to the end of our foundations of importing assets into Unreal Engine. Thank you very much.",
