  "text": " In this part of our optimization tools, I'd like to talk about scalability settings as they allow you to adjust the rendering demands of any scene quickly and easily inside of the editor. We can also use scalability commands to adjust how our project is going to look in a settings menu in the final product once it's been cooked and ready for a user to utilize. Now, what scalability does is again, it adjusts how things are going to be rendered. In the example in front of us, we can see the various default scalability settings taken right from the editor. If we were to click on, say, near or low or medium, we are going to reduce the settings that are used or the rendering demands for that particular category. For example, if we adjust our view distance to near, we are going to reduce the amount of objects that are going to be rendered by pulling the culling or telling the renderer to stop rendering objects past a certain distance closer to the camera. Now, the exact opposite of this is true. If we were to go from, say, near to epic or even cinematic, we would be increasing that distance or increasing that rendering parameter. Now, this does have quite a significant effect on the overall look of your scene. Here we have an example taken from the Electric Dreams demo that shows low, medium, high, epic, and cinematic all taken from the same spot. We can really see the difference between low and cinematic. There is just no shadows in low, there is no subsurface scattering. It's very low-end looking scene. Then as we start to get to medium, high, epic, and cinematic, we're really starting to turn up the details and increase the overall quality of the scene. Now, there's a tool that we can use to help us further define what is set inside of these settings. We do that using something called the Device Profiles tool. Now, the Device Profiles tool allows us to specify how our project should look when run on a wide range of different devices. Now, to utilize this, we're going to open it up inside of our Unreal Editor session as a separate tool. Then all we need to do to activate each profile is click on the three little ellipses next to the name of the profile we wish to activate. Let's pop over to the editor and look at how we do this. We're going to come up here to our tools, and then under platforms, we're going to have our Device Profiles. Right here is our Device Profiles. Again, if we want to grab our Windows Editor, I'm just going to hit these three little ellipses right here. This is going to bring up the profiles for this. You can see here, we have a bunch of different things that we can do. Underneath rendering, we can add rendering commands like maybe allow HDR or allow static lighting. Once we put one of those in there, I'm just going to expand this. You can see here we can allow static lighting. If we hover over this, it actually is also going to give us a little description of what this command does and the inputs it requires. We can also do this for our scalability group. You can see here we have anti-aliasing. We have quality number of levels for our effects, our foliage, a whole bunch of other options. Again, I can do this, but just close that down here. I can do this for everything. Here is something for iOS. If I scroll down this list further, you're going to see there's a bunch of iPhones in here, iPads, Mac TV. There's all types of Linux stuff. There's Android, all types of different things inside of here that we can set these device profiles to. Again, this allows us to adjust how our project is going to look, not only inside of the editor, but also on the wide range of devices it could be published for.",
