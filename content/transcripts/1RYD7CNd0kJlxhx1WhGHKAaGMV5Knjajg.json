And this is actually really cool. What we're doing is there's a sphere being drawn at x radius and then random points are being sampled from that surface to act as spawn points. So we get this really cool kind of random looking spawn to our particles instead of them all kind of responding at the same time. So let's go ahead and take a look at how we do this inside of the editor now. So inside of our editor, we're going to come here and we're going to look for our shape location. We see that's set to a sphere. So we're going to go ahead and change the shape radius to 25. And that's going to give us a little bit of a bigger area for this to spawn from. And if it's not necessarily apparent, let's change it to something like 100. And you'll see here that it's quite large. So again, I'm just going to leave this back at 45. So that we can have a wider area for things to spawn in.",
