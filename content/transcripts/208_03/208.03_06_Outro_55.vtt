00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So that about wraps up the course.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And just to do a recap of the things we've covered today, and

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
hopefully the things you've learned, we went over some of the considerations that you might need to make before you actually bring your Skeletal Mesh into the engine.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So things like bone orientations, your hierarchy, and how you might want to skin certain parts of your mesh.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Then we set up a few different control types that might be useful for mechanical rigging specifically.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As well as setting up a simple rig for our Mesh where we utilize some of the useful functions and nodes that are specifically aimed at mechanical rigging.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So thank you very much for your time and for following along with the course.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And don't forget we have plenty of other courses available to increase your control rig knowledge.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So if there's anything else you want to learn, please be sure to check those out.

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But otherwise, best of luck with your mechanical rigging and thank you once again.

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Thank you.
