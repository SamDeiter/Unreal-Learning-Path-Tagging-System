00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
So, let's first take a look at planning for the control rig and some considerations to

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.240
make when you're thinking about how your mechanical mesh should be deforming.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.640
So, it's useful to think of it as sort of rigid body versus organic skinning and thinking

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.839
about how each particular piece of the mesh needs to deform.

5
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.199
So mechanical meshes are typically rigid bodies and should be skinned to one bone each.

6
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.039
So, it's very likely that all of your mechanical meshes are broken into many different parts

7
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.079
and you know they're all connected and held together with screws and bolts and rivets

8
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.000
and they all have different pivot points.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.399
So you want these solid parts to only be skinned to one bone so that they don't deform

10
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.799
in an unusual way and you know look all bendy when it's animating.

11
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.120
But that's not necessarily going to be true for every part of your skeletal mesh.

12
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.879
Things like springs should be weighted perfectly evenly between two bones so that when they

13
00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.280
compress and contract they'll be deforming accurately.

14
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.319
And you may also have parts like cables or wires on your mesh that are carrying things

15
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:14.319
like hydraulic fluid or electrical cables and these obviously are going to need to deform

16
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.439
in a more organic way than this big chunk of solid metal.

17
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.959
So they may have several influences from different joints depending on you know how long they

18
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.599
are and how they might need to deform.

19
00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.879
So it's really about considering and thinking how each part of the mesh needs to deform

20
00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.000
and then just skinning them in the appropriate way to make the rigging in the engine a bit

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.439
more straightforward for yourself.

22
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.359
When it comes to orienting your bones it can be really helpful to orient them in the direction

23
00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.759
of travel.

24
00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.119
So typically we would use the X-axis to point down the bone in the direction that that mesh

25
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.599
would travel.

26
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.359
And this is just going to help speed up your rigging workflow in the engine.

27
00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.759
So when you're thinking about things like pistons or any sort of telescopic type movement

28
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.839
being consistent with your axis that you're pointing down the bone can be really helpful.

29
00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:10.799
And when it comes to meshes that act in the same way so like the tires of a car for example

30
00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.479
they're all going to be rolling the same and sort of turning the same.

31
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.479
Setting up all of the bones with the same orientation and this could just be world orienting them

32
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.879
for example can be really helpful in simplifying the control rig logic again because you can

33
00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.599
use the same logic for all of these tires instead of making sort of custom adjustments

34
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.879
per tire to account for any differences in their orientations.

35
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.519
Mirroring bone orientations by behavior can also be very helpful because if you have something

36
00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.280
like a claw grabber that we have here we can set things up so that we can feed the same

37
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.840
logic into both bones and easily use one control to manipulate both of them.

38
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.920
So in this example with this sort of claw grabber that we have here the logic has been

39
00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.080
set up so that we can move this teal colored controller left and right and as we do that

40
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.479
the claw will open and close without having to add any extra logic to account for the

41
00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.080
differences in their orientation.

42
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.319
So we're just grabbing the transform values and converting it to rotations and feeding

43
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.199
that straight into the into the claw bones.

44
00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.039
And there's only possible if you mirror by behavior.

45
00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.479
Something that you might find with your skeleton hierarchy is that you end up having fewer

46
00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:29.399
chains of bones and more individual children coming off a shed parent.

47
00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:34.280
So in this example here we've got a car where we have a root and then each of the wheels

48
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.039
and the doors simply have a single bone to control those meshes.

49
00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:44.759
And with this example of the suspension on the car chassis you can see that this rear

50
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.599
axle and everything that's fixed to it is a child of the same parent on the right here.

51
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.120
And that's because any meshes like suspension springs or damper arms here where each end

52
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.680
is fixed to a different mesh making those bones a child of the mesh that they're fixed

53
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.199
to is going to make things much easier when you're rigging an engine than if you had a

54
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.479
chain of bones here instead.

55
00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.159
So with a mechanical rig you'll probably find that you have fewer chains of joints and more

56
00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.680
single children coming from shed parents of the things that they're affixed to.
