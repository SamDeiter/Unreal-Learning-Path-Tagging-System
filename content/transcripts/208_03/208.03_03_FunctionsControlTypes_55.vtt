00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
When it comes to the tools available in Engine for your control rig, let's take a look at

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.720
some of the functions and control types that can be useful when you're building a mechanical

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.120
rig.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.199
Very often you'll find that something mechanical will contain a piston, whether this is part

5
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.480
of an engine, or a large rubber arm, or just there to support the movement in some other

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480
way.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.400
And for these scenarios, there is a function built into the engine called the piston function.

8
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.799
And that acts as a two-way aim constraint, allowing two elements of the rig, so bones

9
00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:39.000
or controls or nulls, to always be pointing towards one another.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.359
So if each end of the piston is anchored to a different mesh, say for example like the

11
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.959
upper and lower leg of a robotic character, this function will enable those pieces to

12
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:52.679
stay anchored where they are, and then always aim towards one another, maintaining that

13
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.320
functionality of the piston.

14
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.799
Something else that's useful is the FK chain function.

15
00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.640
Now this is for a basic forward kinematic setup, where you just need a control to drive

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.640
the movement of a bone.

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.239
But something great about this is you can actually filter out different translation and rotation

18
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:16.719
axes, and just have it moving in one direction or rotating in one direction if that's what

19
00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.920
you need.

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.319
When it comes to more complex robotic arms or legs, you might have something like a mechanical

21
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.479
arm that you're using on an assembly line, for example.

22
00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.679
And for this you could use the IK3 bone function, which is a great way to get those moving where

23
00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.599
you need precise movement for the end bone in the chain, maybe it's a claw picking something

24
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:44.239
up on an assembly line, and you need the rest of the arm to calculate its movement automatically.

25
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.280
And when it comes to dynamic movement for your mesh, so this would be things like cables

26
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.599
or chains on your mechanical mesh.

27
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.239
There are a couple of useful functions that help you get some dynamic movement.

28
00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.799
So there's the local chain dynamics function, which will apply a sort of physics effect

29
00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.479
to a chain of bones just using maths.

30
00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.560
And there's the add jiggle function that simulates on just one element of the rig, which might

31
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.519
be a bone or a control rather than an entire chain of bones.

32
00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.359
And it essentially uses a spring interpolate node to try and reach a target, whilst also

33
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.480
allowing you to add a delay and damping on its movement.

34
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.720
So it looks like it's jiggling as the rest of the mesh is moving.

35
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.960
Taking a look at some useful control types here, depending on what type of control you

36
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.400
create, you can actually give it different limits and force it to move in different ways.

37
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.480
So we have a mechanical arm here that's been set up.

38
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.320
And for this yellow control here, if we were to select it, you'll see that we can't

39
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.359
rotate in either the y or z axis, or can only rotate in the x axis.

40
00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.159
And that's because for this type of control, we've set it to be a rotator.

41
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.599
That means it only has rotation, or it only has the possibility to rotate.

42
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.919
And under the settings here, we're actually able to give it some minimax settings.

43
00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:20.120
So if you were to activate minimax for x and y, sorry, for y and z, and to set them both

44
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.480
at zero, that would limit the movement so that it can't move in those axes.

45
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.360
And you can only move in the open one.

46
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.159
You can also change this to a position, for example, if you wanted to only have translation

47
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.040
values, which can also be very handy.

48
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.640
Now something else that has a slightly more complex setup is a float control here.

49
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.640
If I just zoom in, you can see that as we move this float control down, this claw opens

50
00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:53.439
up, and as we move it back, it closes.

51
00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.239
And that's because we're essentially converting the transform information, or the float that

52
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.239
comes out of the movement of this control, into rotation information for these two claw

53
00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.879
bones.

54
00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.639
And in utilizing these different control types with their min and max settings, you can quickly

55
00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.719
get something moving in a mechanical way, when you're locking down the different axes

56
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.800
in which it shouldn't be able to move.
