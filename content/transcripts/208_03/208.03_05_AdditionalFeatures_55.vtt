00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That about wraps up our exploration with some different tools that are helpful with mechanical rigging specifically.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But I just wanted to briefly touch on a few more useful tools that are available in Control Rig,

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that we don't have time to look at within this course, but might help you out when you're building your own Control Rigs.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So you can create your own function libraries, which is essentially a way to package up sections of logic within your Rig Graph

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
into a custom function. And you can then share that across all of the Control Rigs in your project just by setting it public.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Just the same as how the standard function library was created that comes with the engine,

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
where we've been using functions like the Jiggle function, the FK chain and the local chain dynamics functions.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And this can just be super helpful essentially to speed things up when you're creating your rigs.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There are also a bunch of nodes and functions that enable you to create splines and attach bones to them.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you can create these procedurally using the construction event,

11
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which give you a pretty interesting way of controlling the bones within your mesh and can really increase the flexibility of your rig.

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now something that's really cool about Control Rig is the hierarchy of your controls isn't necessarily fixed,

13
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which means at runtime you're able to dynamically update the hierarchy,

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
giving you a greater degree of control and enabling you to set up the control systems that you wouldn't be able to otherwise.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Control Rig also has a very useful debug mode, which has a bunch of features available to help you track down any issues with your rig and get them fixed.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So two very useful features for this are breakpoints,

17
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which allow you to just step through the logic of your rig graph and find out where things might be going wrong so you can fix them.

18
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And visual profiling, which is essentially a visual representation, kind of like a heat map of how costly something might be in terms of computational expense,

19
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which is going to help you understand how expensive different features and functions are to help you optimize your rigs.

20
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And you can access this specifically from the class settings, so under the VM runtime heading, if you just tick enable profiling, that'll give you access to this.
