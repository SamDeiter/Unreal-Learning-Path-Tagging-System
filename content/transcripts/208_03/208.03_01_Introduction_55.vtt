00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to the Control Rig Mechanical Rigging Unreal Engine Training course.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The aim of this course is to go over a handful of useful functions and features available within Control Rig

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that would help you in creating a rig for a skeletal mesh that needs mechanical accuracy.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We'll first take a look at some considerations you might need to make before getting into the engine

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to help you plan out your Control Rig.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now this will be about things like bone orientations and hierarchies depending on how something might need to move

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and some thoughts about how you should be skinning your meshes.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then we'll take a look at some specific functions and control types and settings that can be useful when you're creating a mechanical rig

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to help you set up your controls in such a way that you can achieve more mechanical accuracy.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And then we'll jump into the engine to take a look at some of these tools in action,

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
building a control rig for one of the skeletal meshes within the project.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And lastly just to wrap up with some additional features that are available within the Control Rig Graph

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that might be useful when you're building your own Control Rig.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We've included a project with the course content folder, so be sure to open that up and follow along as we're taking a look at these features

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and building out the Control Rig.
