00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
The local chain dynamics function is a super simple function to set up.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.919
And this is more useful when you have a longer chain of bones compared to the jiggle function.

3
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.960
So back into our project here, if we search for local chain dynamics,

4
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.320
we'll find our function just here, I just zoom in on that.

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.519
You can see that all the function really needs as an input is an array of bones.

6
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.439
So this will essentially just be from your first to your last bone in your chain.

7
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.119
Now if I come up to the viewport here and show our bones,

8
00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.799
we've not got many long chains of bones on this mesh here,

9
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:47.320
but we do have a chain of two bones here for these cables underneath the main gun.

10
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.200
And what we're going to do is select those two bones,

11
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480
drag them in and choose create item array.

12
00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.479
And for this, you would just connect them straight up to the bones input pin.

13
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:08.399
And if we connect the logic up, we should quite quickly see that we get some movement on these or this chain.

14
00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.400
So it's super, super quick to set up.

15
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.400
And now you have the option to play with all of the properties of the function here.

16
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
So we have the strength and damping that we can tweak,

17
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
which works the same as it does with the jiggle function.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.400
You also have access to the blend start and end here,

19
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
which essentially allow you to determine the strength of the dynamics at the start and end of the chain.

20
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.400
And then we have blend twist, which allows you to determine how much twist you want on the chain.

21
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
So what we could do here, if we see it moving perhaps a bit too much,

22
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.400
we could increase the strength here, which will increase the stiffness to something like six.

23
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.400
And now it feels a little less floaty and there's a little bit more rigidity to it when it's coming back to settle.

24
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
And you could crank that up to eight just to see how things look.

25
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400
And you can see it doesn't swing out as far and it's a bit more stiff than it was before.

26
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.400
This chain's not super long, so we're not going to be able to get many settings out of the blend start and end and twist settings here.

27
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400
But what we can do is add our other chain.

28
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.400
So we have two cords hanging underneath this gun.

29
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.400
So I could select all of these cords like this, connect them up, hit compile.

30
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
And that will affect both of the chains individually like that.

31
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Now you could do this for several chains and they'd use the same settings essentially,

32
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.400
but if you wanted to change these, you'd need one function per chain.

33
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.400
To demonstrate this with a longer chain of bones, I've just opened up another character here

34
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.400
and I very quickly made just a pelvis control that we're copying the transforms from onto the pelvis bone.

35
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.400
And then the local chain dynamics function where we've set up an array that contains our spine and our neck.

36
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
So you can add a bunch of bones in here as long as they're in a chain

37
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.400
and then you can see that that affects the whole body in this case.

38
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400
And this is how it essentially works just with a longer chain here.

39
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
And again, you can tweak all these settings to make anything a little bit stiffer.

40
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.400
So you can see that if this was kind of moving robotically, you might be able to get some chain movement

41
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.400
on any sort of hydronic pipes that you might have or chains that you might have.

42
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.400
And obviously you can tweak all these settings here to customize the look of that.

43
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
But yeah, I just wanted to briefly show that to show that it's not just for short chains of bones that we used it for in the demo here,

44
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
but you can also use it for long chains.

45
00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.400
And really that's more what it's designed for in comparison to the jiggle function.

46
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.400
But there we go. That's just a quick setup of the local chain dynamics.
