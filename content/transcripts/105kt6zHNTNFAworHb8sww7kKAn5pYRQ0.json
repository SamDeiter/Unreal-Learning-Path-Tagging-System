  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on concepts. In this we are going to do an overview of the three primary components that are going to control the animation. That is the controller, the pawn and the animation blueprint. Firstly, we have the controller. It's like a central command unit that steers the behaviour of pawns. Pawns are characters or objects within the game world. Now this can work by either interpreting the player input or it could be controlled by an AI. So the computer would control it using something like a behaviour tree. Next we have the pawn which is the physical representation of the character in the game. It is vital for defining how a character moves and interacts with the game's physics. Finally we have the animation blueprint which is a system for animating a skeletal mesh. Within this we have two main elements, the event graph and the amygraph. The event graph plays a critical role by receiving data from other sources and then processing that data so that it can be used to generate the animations. This data will then be funneled into the amygraph. The amygraph itself, short for animation graph, is tasked with processing the incoming data to drive the animation, ensuring that the character's movements are both fluid and accurate. It can also use state machines and the control rig to produce complicated animations that respond to the gameplay. Together these components work in tandem to bring the character to life, providing a seamless and interactive player experience. Understanding how they interlink is crucial for any developer looking to set up a professional looking game animation. Let's go through the animation process step by step so that we can see how they connect. So firstly we have the pawn or character which carries a skeletal mesh. This mesh is the framework that defines the physical structure and appearance of the character in the game world. Secondly the skeletal mesh is equipped to hold and execute the animation blueprint. These blueprints are pivotal in defining the character's movement and behaviour. Thirdly the animation blueprint processes the amygraph's output. The amygraph is the engine that calculates the character's animation state frame by frame based on the gameplay and the environmental interaction. Finally we have the event graph that collects and decipher data for the amygraph. It acts as a conduit enabling the animation blueprint to respond dynamically to real-time gameplay events. This is all we are going to cover for concepts. We will be going over a lot of other elements however this is best done in the context of an exercise. This will allow us to see how everything fits together in context. So our next video we will be starting setting up for the exercise.",
