  "text": " In this chapter, we're going to break it down into two parts. The first is importing assets from the Unreal Marketplace. You are absolutely allowed to use anything on the Marketplace for commercial use, and you don't have to pay royalties. It's great. It means that you can grab a lot of awesome content. Included with this is actually curated content that's absolutely free. One of those that we're going to use is the Automotive Materials Pack. In future classes, you will dive into how to make these amazing high quality materials, but we're going to shortcut our way in this particular class. We're going to use the Automotive Materials. To acquire this asset pack, all we need to do is in your Epic Launchers, click the Marketplace tab and then underneath Search Products, search for Automotive Materials. You're looking for the one that was authored by Epic Games. All you need to do is, more than likely, you'll have two buttons here. You just need to say, Add to Cart, or I think Buy Now, or just Get It, because again, it's free. Once you do that, you'll have this Add to Project. We have the Automotive Materials already pre-included with the course, so you don't need to download those, but I do want to show you this process. Once you've purchased or acquired content from the Marketplace, you'll have the ability to add to project. You'll click Add to Project, search for the project that you've created, and it will drop it into your game's content folder. Now that we've got that, we can go back to our project. In fact, if I just pull it up real fast, we can see, in fact, we have it here, Content Automotive Materials, which is in here. One of the things to take note of is, again, we're going to take advantage of a lot of these very, very high-quality materials. If I just open up, for example, this blue Car Paint, and I kind of move around our scene, you can see that this is very well done. In fact, it might be a little difficult to see, but there's Car Paint flakes in here. This is a great, excellent pack. If you are curious, one of the things that's very nice about purchasing content from the is, generally speaking, not only do you get the content, but you also get demo scenes. You can have things pre-set up for you, or showcasing how they work, how they look, et cetera. Another thing as well, which is extremely helpful, is we can go into the material itself. For example, I'm looking at this Car Paint dark, and I can just browse to the Car Paint master, double-click it, open it, and now I have access to a very well-structured, very well-built material. Now, there's a lot of notes in here. We're not going to go deep into this. The point here is that, again, when you are purchasing these assets, you have the opportunity to kind of learn how the author or authors of that content put it together, and therefore you can reverse engineer it. Additionally, absolutely feel free to pilfer some of the setups, some of the ways that they did things for your own assets. And again, too, what's great about anything you acquire from the marketplace, the in-room marketplace, is you can use it in commercial projects and no strings attached. So again, feel free to do whatever you want with these materials, learn how they're built, reverse engineer them, or just even use them in your project. So that's what we're going to do with ours, is we're going to use these materials. Now something I do want to make note of is included in the project is something that we call a collection. Now a collection, basically, underneath your content view options is .collections. So this should be turned on by default. If you don't see it, your content browser will probably look something like this. So we'll expand out the side window, under view options, .collections. Now what collections are is they're just a nice collection of assets that you want to use. So for example, if I go down to this car paint, you'll see that we've got a blue paint and a charcoal paint. Now I haven't moved these assets outside of where they reside in the project, but instead I've just said, hey, I would like to use these. I'm going to earmark these as content that I want to use in the future. And so with that, these collections again have been set up that you can follow with the project. At any point, if you're not sure where something is located. So for example, if I go down to HDRI and I look at our small hanger, I can just right click on this and then I can do show in folder view. And then that will take us to where it resides in the content files. Again, these collections have been set up for you guys ahead of time to make it easier for you to follow along and not have to go digging through content. All right, so let's move on to the next section, which is going to be importing our content using data Smith.",
