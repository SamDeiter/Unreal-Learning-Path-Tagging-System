  "text": " The Unreal Engine 5 Level Editor is a very powerful tool and a tool to spend quite a bit of time in, as this is how we build the interactions or projects we wish inside of Unreal Engine 5. Let's go ahead and pop into the Editor real quick and have a look at it in more detail. We can navigate through this using the WAS and D keys or the left and right mouse buttons depending on our preference. The Editor viewport is in real time and if we want to adjust something in the Editor, we can simply click on it. Once we do that, whatever we click on's properties will be displayed inside of the Details panel over here, allowing us to adjust whatever we wish to adjust. Remember, this Editor is happening in real time, so what we see here is going to be the same if we come up to if we press play. The only time this could be different is if you're deploying to a mobile device or a console, as there could be slight differences in the rendering. But the Level Editor does provide a very accurate representation of what you could expect the end rendering to be.",
