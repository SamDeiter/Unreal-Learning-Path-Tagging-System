  "text": " Our Landscape Quick Start is going to have us first start with going over how to create a new landscape and the various options that we have there available. We're then going to take a look at how we can use the various tools Unreal Engine provides to allow us to sculpt the look of our landscape. Once we've done that, we'll take a look at how we can utilize Unreal Engine's Material System to help us define where we can paint different areas of our landscape, such as areas that should be grass, dirt, or rock. We'll then take a look at how we can use the Foliage tool to apply different static meshes to represent things like trees, bushes, rocks, and even grass to help give our landscape a better sense of realism. And finally, we'll take a look at how we can utilize Unreal Engine 5's Water Tools plugin to add lakes, rivers, streams, and even oceans to our landscapes. We've got a lot to cover in this Quick Start, so let's go ahead and get started with creating a new landscape.",
