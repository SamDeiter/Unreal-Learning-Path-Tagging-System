  "text": " At this point, we've been using Unreal Engine's internal recording systems to record our animation sequences. However, we're going to take a look at the Take Recorder that allows us to then edit real-time within Sequencer. Let's begin. Before we hop into the Engine to start recording our final animation, we want to be sure to turn on the Take Recorder, which is a plugin, as you can see from here. Once we have that turned on, then we're going to go over a few settings, as you can see here, and make sure that we're all set up and ready to go to record. Let's hop into the Engine. Now that we're back in the Engine, we're going to need to activate the Take Recorder plugin. Let's go ahead and do that. You can find that two different ways. You can go under the Settings plugin, or you can come up here to Edit plugins. Either way will get you there. We're going to go ahead and search for the Take Recorder. As you see as we start to type, you'll notice we get the Take Recorder. This is the one we want. Go ahead and checkmark that and hit Restart Now. It'll take it a few seconds in order for it to load and restart. While we wait for our project to restart, let's take a look at some things. Once we have it activated, we are going to begin to record the physics action. That means we need to have the ability to do it immediately. One of the settings that we need to get to is changing the three seconds, which we'll see here, which is a countdown that is located under the User Settings. We'll activate that via the Setting gear here. Then we'll go over some of these other things. This is important to make sure we clear that out. Otherwise we'll hit Simulate and it'll do a countdown when we're waiting on the recording. We won't be able to capture all of it. You'll see in a minute that it does. This will talk about our character as the source and we'll show how to do that. This also shows you to simulate and immediately press Record so you can see why that three seconds is important to get rid of. Then we're going to stop to do our animation. Let's get back into the engine. We're back in the engine. As promised, we're going to go over a few of these settings, especially the ones that are very important, such as this gear up here to select the settings that we need to get rid of the three seconds. Let's go ahead and do that first so we don't forget to do that. You'll see here, here's the countdown. I've already deleted it and changed it to zero seconds so there won't be a countdown. This can be useful for other things if you're working with typical sequences, but when you're working with physics, you do not want this to be set to three seconds. You want zero. You want to give us a chance to record as soon as we're ready. Once you're done changing that, we can then come up here, turn that off. We'll take a look at the clear pinning, which is, as it states, it will clear the takes out of the take selection. Now, once we do have a recording, this will highlight or light up and show us that we can review the last recording, which will then open up a level sequence, a sequencer for us to take a look at. This one here is important. This will show a listing of all of our level sequences or takes as we do each and every one of them. If we do multiples, it's going to add more and more. This is nice. It gives us a full listing. Let's add our source. Go ahead and select your characters. You can select one or both. It doesn't matter. Name them as source. As soon as you do that, you'll see add current selection, which is the two actors. Now, be very careful not to select the sky. You can do that by accident. Make sure that you're selecting the add current selection and it's the two highlighted actors. As soon as we select that, we'll see that they are added. Now, another nice feature is you see this preset is we can save a preset if we wish. For example, add any specific actors and however your setup is, it will save it. You don't have to do that every time. When you open up your project, you can turn them on, off or reload your preset. That's very handy. I'm going to leave them on as it shows. You'll see it says 16 properties in one component. These are all the things that are attached to us like cameras or other blueprints or anything else that's involved with that. That's what all that means. All right. Now we're going to begin the recording. What we need to do is we need to make sure we're ready to hit this and then record. Then we can hit stop and then we'll just go ahead and stop the simulation afterwards. Order does count. Don't hit record first, rather the simulate. Here we go. Keep our fingers crossed and let's see what happens. I mean, stimulate, record. We're going to watch it and wait for it to end there. That looks like they're pretty settled there. Go ahead and hit stop simulate up here. You'll notice everything resets back. We cover what this occurs as in spawning and possessibles in our sequencer class. I won't go over that right now, but this is our recording. We've got it set and so you'll notice sequencer opened. Now let's go back to take recorder and let's look at our previewing the last recording review. Now, this is the main or think of this kind of like the parent sequence. We can just move that out and make those disappear. If you want to see each of these actors. You notice we had two actors, so we have two different channels here. If we double click into them, we'll be able to see the actual spawning as well as some keen transforms of everything that occurred. So as you can probably see, that means yes, you guessed it. We can edit that even further. Now we could take that further and edit it with a control rig by assigning it to the character and then going through and changing things as we like with that preset animation that occurred via physics. So that's one of the powerful things that we can do. So let's take a look a little further into our sequencer and go from there. So in order to edit said animation that we have listed here, I've got the Manny simple, which is this character right here. And I need to unlock it. So to unlock it, we merely just have to come over here and click that and it's unlocked. So that means now we can actually take here and edit this even further. We could add a control rig as an additive to edit this further if we wish to, or many other things. We could come in here and edit multiple things. Now I will say do not edit with FK because we've got some IK going on with these characters. And if you do, it's just going to be straight up. He's just going to fall. No arms doing anything. So don't use the edit FK feature. All right. So now with that, we're going to do something a little different. We're going to take this even further and we're going to turn off our characters in the tape recorder that we have listed here. And we are going to record the actual player. So you can see how much more you can do beyond this. In order to record the player, we have to do a few things. So why would we want to do this? For example, let's say that you had a character and you wanted to get some quick animation out of the game or whatever you were running. What you would do is you would run the game and you would hit the tape recorder and basically record the player. But for it to see the player, we have to add it as a source. So we're going to go on into our next little part of the lesson and we're going to record runtime within sequencer. Before we can begin to record, we need to change a few settings. So as you can see, we're going to need to be sure to turn off our mannequin as well selected viewport in our play because we are set on simulate. We won't have to select the player as a source. Let's hop back into the engine. Let's get started with those settings. So define that one. Let's go ahead and select here. Change this to the selected viewport. And of course, it's going to play. So go ahead and hit stop. And you can just leave it here if you want. Then the next thing we need to do is come over to tape recorder and turn these two characters off. You could delete them if you want, but I'm going to leave them on or rather off, but I'm not going to delete it. And then I'm going to change the source to the player. Now the player is our player capsule. So we're going to be recording the player in real time. And we can then later edit that if we choose to. Now the other ones that you see the nearby spawn, you can say, for example, that would be good for shooting like fireballs and picking it up at runtime, which is great. It's another little source you can do, but we're going to stick with the player. So we'll just add that and then we'll be able to record that and clean any animations up either via baking to a control rig or simply adding some other additive tracks, some other added animations. So lots of great power that we have at our source. So now I think we're ready to go. Let's go ahead and let's record. All right. We are ready to hit play. So remember, play, then record, but as fast as you can. So you could actually drag this out to be a little closer if you wish. So you can just grab it like so. It's kind of leave it free docking. Hit play, record, and then we're just going to kind of run around and move this thing around. We're recording it. Jump we and we notice, oh, hey, look, our buddies fell down while that was occurring. I'm going to kick them around, knock them off there. I'm feeling crazy. Do another jump and then I'm going to go ahead and hit stop. It's going to hit stop and our recording stopped and then we can browse to that. So if you were curious where your takes were recorded and saved is under a new folder that will be created, which is cinematics takes and even further are each of the subscenes. So we can go into that or we can just hit our preview recorder and a redock this here very carefully. And you'll see we even have some cut scenes with the camera that shows us what's going on. So this is really great. And you could even go even further and double click. And then we could come in here and add a control rig. Or we can even preview it by merely locking it to the camera, just clicking this here and that'll lock it to there. And then if you were to hit play, you can kind of see what he's going to do. Remember, I took some time to get started and jumping around crazy and it did record the capsule. No worries. And see, because we didn't have the characters in that as a source, it didn't record them. But we have that there. Now there's some other things I want to show you real quickly is the animation feature. And when you assign a control rig, it gives you even more ability to to edit. But we're not going to do that. We just want to kind of show some other things that give us, for example, you could even have trails on. And let it see the animation trails as it's going through here. And you could be able to animate that. But we're going to stop here now and kind of do a wrap up of everything that we've done and go from there.",
