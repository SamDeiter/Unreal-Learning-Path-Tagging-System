00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Okay, so now that we know how to actually manage our landscapes, I think it's time we

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.680
take a look at all the ways in which we can actually create landscapes inside of Unreal

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.680
Engine.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.440
So, there's a few ways of doing it.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.520
Perhaps the easiest way to actually go ahead about doing this is just using the open world

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520
template.

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.720
So, this is an open world template that's going to come with a 2km by 2km landscape

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.700
that already has a landscape material setup and all the setups that you'd actually need

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.960
if you wanted to create an open world type game.

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.080
So, it comes with a world partition, one file per actor, data layers, hierarchical levels

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
of details.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.800
It's actually a really, really handy template.

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.720
So, if you wanted to create a landscape that you can start editing from there in this way,

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.160
all you have to do is make a new level and make sure you choose the open world template

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
here.

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And there you go.

17
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.200
You've got a really nice landscape that's already set up for a lot of features and you're

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
good to go.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.040
You can just go ahead and edit this.

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.240
That's one way that you can do it.

21
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.760
Now, the other way that you can do it is by just having a basic world.

22
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.080
And the only reason I'm choosing basic is because we've got a bit of lighting so we

23
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.800
can see what we're doing.

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.480
But essentially, you can create a landscape the way we've been creating it.

25
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.040
So, if we go to create new, I'm going to untick edit layers there because that's something

26
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.660
I'm going to cover in a second.

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.520
But you could just set up, look at the chart, figure it out, figure out what landscape size

28
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520
you want, press create.

29
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
And there we go.

30
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520
We've got a landscape.

31
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.220
I can go ahead and start sculpting on this and edit it.

32
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.380
Now, one thing that I did want to cover about landscapes that we haven't covered up until

33
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.700
now is that tick box that I just had to untick there, which is the edit layers.

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380
So if we have enable edit layers, when I create this, we get this really handy feature here

35
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.500
called edit layers, which essentially allows me to store the data that I painted inside

36
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.540
of one of the landscapes into a layer, which means I can slowly use this alpha value to

37
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.080
change the way in which my landscape edits in affects the actual landscape.

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.900
To create a new layer, all I have to do is right click create.

39
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.820
And now as long as I've got that layer selected, I'll be storing in that layer the information

40
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.380
that I'm painting now.

41
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.540
And again, all I can do, all I need to do is to click and drag this alpha value.

42
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.140
I can go ahead and edit the intensity or the effect that that layer has on the landscape

43
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.140
itself.

44
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.220
This is a really, really useful tool that I actually really can't live without now.

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.500
So I recommend that you actually set it up when you do your own landscape.

46
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.180
Now the last way that we can create a landscape is to just import a height map that we've

47
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.740
generated in something like World Machine or Zebra or Houdini, any real software and

48
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.700
any other DCCE application where you can actually generate a terrain height map image.

49
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
You could use the import into Unreal and generate that landscape from it.

50
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
So how do we go about doing that?

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.700
Well, let's go ahead and delete this landscape once again.

52
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.380
And let's go ahead back to our landscape tool.

53
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.820
And we're going to say import from file.

54
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.980
Now I already have a file set up here, but I'd encourage you to just go into Photoshop

55
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.940
and just paint a few lines in black and white and make sure that you export this as a 16

56
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.620
bit depth image, okay, which you could save as a PNG.

57
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.820
In our case, we've already got one ready.

58
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.300
And remember that the size of this have to be relating to the chart that we mentioned

59
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.300
earlier.

60
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.860
So in our case, it's going to be 1009 by 1009.

61
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.700
So we've got the right resolution.

62
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.340
I've got a scale value here of 150 that I edited already.

63
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.900
And I'm just going to move the landscape up a little bit and let's go ahead and import.

64
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.380
And once we press import, you can see when we generate it from DCC package like this,

65
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.220
we really get a nice level of detail that might be much harder for us to manually paint

66
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.220
inside of Unreal.

67
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.220
So if you want something that's artistic like this, this is a really good tool.

68
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.140
And the beauty of this is that you can still edit it.

69
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.940
So if you wanted to flatten a certain section of this, you could go ahead and use the flatten

70
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.700
tool and flatten it out.

71
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.680
But yeah, put your little houses there if you need to.

72
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.560
Essentially, these are all the ways that we can create a landscape.

73
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.920
And as I say, it's a really versatile system.

74
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.920
I hope this has been useful for you.

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.040
The overall things that we've covered are just a few technical details and real world

76
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.880
scenarios in which we can actually create landscape.

77
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.540
We took a look at the managing tools or the manage tab for landscapes and how we can manage

78
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.720
things like LOD in per component and how we can use spline.

79
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.360
We also actually adjust the terrain of the landscape itself, how we can add or delete

80
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.640
components.

81
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.520
And then lastly, we went over different creation techniques for landscapes.

82
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.760
We've only really scratched the surface of what we can do in landscape.

83
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.200
So in the next few courses, we'll be doing stuff that's a lot more detailed and take

84
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.160
a look at things like landscape materials and other fun stuff to do with this amazing

85
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.920
tool, the landscape tool itself.

86
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.880
I hope you enjoyed this and I'll see you next time.
