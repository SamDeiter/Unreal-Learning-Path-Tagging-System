00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
So, if we take a look at this image here, this is the gizmo essentially that you'll

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.060
be presented with when you go to create a landscape.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.920
So to enter this mode, if I go into my empty project here, and I've already entered it

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.160
here but I'll go from scratch.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.680
So you can see if I've got a completely blank level, I can go to my landscape mode and I'll

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.620
straight away be presented with the landscape creation tool.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.780
It's without any landscape to actually edit and have like you need to something to create.

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.180
So let's take a look at what each section of this actually means.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
So I'm going to go back to my slides so that we can see it a little bit clearer.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.620
But essentially we've got the yellow outline here which is going to be the landscape actor

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.620
edge itself.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
So that's the edge of the full landscape considering everything.

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.580
Then we've got these light green lines here which might even be easier to see on the landscape

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.460
creation tool here but you've got the lighter green lines in the middle here and they're

15
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.820
going to be our landscape component edges.

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.580
Then we've got the sort of medium green lines here which are going to be the landscape section

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.940
edge and then we've got each individual quad of the landscape itself.

18
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.540
So that's the sort of color coding that gives you the information about how your landscape

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.440
is going to be set up once you press create.

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240
Now it's important to understand how landscapes are divided.

21
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.380
Landscapes are divided into multiple components which are essentially Unreal's base unit of

22
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.180
rendering, visibility calculations and collisions.

23
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.540
This is pertaining to the landscape specifically by the way and this isn't something that

24
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.240
is relevant to anything else other than landscape.

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.020
So components themselves in a landscape are all the same size and are always going to

26
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.300
be square.

27
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.980
Now the size of these components are going to be decided when the landscape is created

28
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.740
and the choice is going to essentially depend on the size and detail of landscape that you

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.100
want to create.

30
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.940
Now components can optionally be divided into either one or four in two by two subsections.

31
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.520
So using the four subsections gives you the same size of a height map as using four times

32
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.900
as many components as a landscape with only one subsection each.

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
However it's important to understand that using fewer components generally gives better

34
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.140
performance so sometimes it's actually better to get a little bit more resolution and use

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.380
fewer components than going for less vertices overall and more components.

36
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.420
So that's something to keep in mind when creating your landscapes.

37
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.140
Now when we go to actually create a landscape one of the things that's really important

38
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700
is to understand what scale we want to set our z height at because that's going to define

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.020
the height that the landscape is actually going to have.

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.820
Now if I take a look at it what we're talking about here in engine is this scale here that's

41
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.380
set to 100 by default.

42
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.060
Now what we want to be thinking of is a ratio of 1 over 512.

43
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.820
Now what does this actually mean?

44
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.420
When we import custom height maps we need to use this ratio to understand the correct

45
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.800
height depth that we want to use.

46
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.580
So essentially Unreal Engine is going to try and calculate the overall height of your height

47
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.780
map based on this information that you're feeding in.

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.280
So the height or the height or z value of our height map is going to be stored used

49
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.220
in values between minus 256 and 255.992 and this is important to understand as well that

50
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.740
it's stored with 16 bit position.

51
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.460
So when you create your textures and want to import them into Unreal for the height

52
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.060
information of a terrain or landscape you need to make sure that they're exported with

53
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.540
16 bit position.

54
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.900
So it's important to understand then that with that information and the standing a scale

55
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.500
value of 1 results in a maximum height of around 256 centimeters and maximum depth going

56
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.180
down of minus 256 centimeters which is really small.

57
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.380
By default then because we have a scale of 100 it means that our landscape range is going

58
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.560
to have a value between 256 meters going up and minus 256 meters going down.

59
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.240
If we wanted to actually calculate this in a more real world case scenario we can take

60
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.560
a look at Mauna Kea inside of Hawaii which is the highest peak of Hawaii at 4027 meters.

61
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.780
If we wanted to create this landscape within Unreal and we wanted to calculate what the

62
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.420
z height of this landscape should be we'd have to go by the following method.

63
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.460
So we take the height and turn it into centimeters because that's the Unreal Engine units we'd

64
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:24.380
be using and that centimeter we multiply by that ratio that we defined in the previous

65
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.940
slide.

66
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.420
So the overall height or z height or z scale of our landscape here would have to be 821.6

67
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.180
and we didn't put this in here in our actual landscape scale section here on the create

68
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.300
tab.

69
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.260
Now the only problem with this is that this doesn't actually account for the amount of

70
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.380
actual mountain that goes underneath in the deep under the sea below sea level.

71
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.460
So the way we'd actually calculate this properly would be to include that.

72
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.260
So if we included that which is another 5,761 meters we would add these two together which

73
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.740
gives you an overall number of centimeters of 996,800 centimeters then we'd multiply

74
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.980
that by our ratio and that's the actual height that we'd want to be using to take into account

75
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.560
that sort of sea level and beneath sea information about this mountain.

76
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.400
So that's the kind of real world case scenario which you'd want to use to calculate the correct

77
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.460
sizes and z height specifically for your landscape.

78
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.860
Now when we actually go to create a landscape Epic has already provided us with a really

79
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.900
handy chart that gives us recommended sizes that will essentially allow us to maximize

80
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.300
the area that we're using while minimizing the number of landscape components that we

81
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.740
have to create.

82
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.460
So this chart is actually a really good resource to use when trying to determine the size of

83
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.260
the landscape you want to use.

84
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.580
If you use a size that isn't on this list essentially your landscape will have to make

85
00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.580
an extra row of components and vertices that might cause errors or undesirable results.

86
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.740
So if we were to actually create a landscape we'd want to use this chart and the way we'd

87
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.740
go about it let's say for example we want to create a smallish 253 by 253 landscape

88
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.660
we would essentially follow the chart itself to get the right values.

89
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.260
So I would go to my overall resolution here and go to 253 by 253.

90
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.900
You can see Unreal Engine is already going to sort of automatically try and adjust to

91
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.780
the things that we're actually trying to create here.

92
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:39.820
So you can see I've got a 253 by 253, 2 by 2 subsections and 63 by 63 sections per component

93
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.140
sorry section sizes.

94
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.740
So if we take a look at the chart at this here this is essentially the landscape that

95
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.020
I'd be making.

96
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.780
It's really quite straightforward once you start to use it and Unreal Engine is going

97
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.860
to actually take over and do as much as it can for you but it's good to always go to

98
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.300
this chart to make sure that you stick to these sizes in order to get a nice performance

99
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.300
and not so error prone landscape itself.
