00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Okay, so let's go ahead and take a look at the landscape manage mode.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.360
For this, it's actually best if we just jump into the engine.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.040
So I'm going to go ahead and do that so we can take a look at the tools itself within

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.900
the context of the engine.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400
So if I open up my editor here, I've got an empty map essentially with a little bit of

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.840
light things that we can see what we're doing.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.640
And I'm going to go to my landscape tool and just create a flat normal landscape.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.840
You can see I've got it set up to 1009 by 1009, which is one of the recommended size

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520
on the chart.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
And let's go ahead and press create.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.320
Now if I go to manage tab here, the manage tab essentially allows you to create or modify

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.640
landscape components itself.

13
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.320
So there's a few options here.

14
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.240
We've got the new tab or the new button here, which allows you to create a new material,

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.840
a new landscape completely.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.800
Import allows you to create a new landscape based on a height map texture that you will

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.680
import, which we're going to take a look at later on.

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.400
Let's go take a look at the meat and potatoes of this section here, which is these tools

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.920
over here, like select, add, delete and splines really.

20
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.560
So select allows me to select a few components and then I can go on the details panel to

21
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.520
actually edit them.

22
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.120
You can see everything's grayed out here.

23
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.680
And the only reason for this is because I don't have my landscape actually selected

24
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
in the outline.

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
And so if I have the landscape selected, when I select those components, you can see now

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
I can actually edit them.

27
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.840
So select allows you to select and deselect if you, you know, re-click on a selected component.

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.440
And you can see we have a brush size here.

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.920
And if I bring this brush size up, you can see it allows you to select more components

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
at once.

31
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.040
So this is consistent across all of these tools.

32
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.760
So you should feel comfortable using it once you create a new or make a new selection or

33
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760
add something.

34
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.160
And then we've got a little button here that's handy to just clear the selection so that

35
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.560
we don't have to individually deselect the sections that we want.

36
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.440
Add allows us to add a landscape component.

37
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.200
So for example, I can just click and drag and add a new, an entire new row and delete

38
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.880
can allow us to do exactly the same, but just, well, exactly the opposite rather and delete

39
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
sections.

40
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.480
Now, move and resize, we're going to skip for this.

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.540
Move just to give you a quick overview.

42
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
We need kind of a level set up to look at this, but it gives you the ability to move

43
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.840
certain components to different streaming levels so they can be streamed in and out

44
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.480
independently from the rest of the landscape, which is a nice sort of performance optimization

45
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
that you could use.

46
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.680
Resize allows you to resize the landscape.

47
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.520
And then the splines tool is the one I wanted to take a look at because this one's actually

48
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520
quite powerful.

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.020
It allows you to edit the landscape based on splines that you can draw.

50
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.480
So say for example, I press control click to add a new spline point.

51
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.280
I can press control click again to add a few spline points.

52
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
And with these, I can also rotate them to change the tangents and say, for example,

53
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.280
I would raise this point here and maybe lower this point a little bit.

54
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960
Once I click deform landscape to splines, and in this case, I'll just click all splines

55
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.800
because we only have one, but you can see it will actually deform the landscape to the

56
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000
spline that I created, which is a really handy tool.

57
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.460
And one other thing that I quite like about it is that it's additive.

58
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.740
So once you've selected that, you could actually move this over and then add to that landscape

59
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.440
that you created.

60
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.880
So really neat little tool to actually just get some basic shapes and information layout

61
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.620
just with some easy splines.

62
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.160
Now when we take a look at managing and kind of like a real use case of how, you know,

63
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.840
why we'd want to select a particular landscape components, let's say for example, that this

64
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.080
is the playable space of the other player and that these landscape components, you know,

65
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.940
they have some, let's say, let's give it some mountains, you know, some really, really

66
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.060
basic mountains that I'm going to make here.

67
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.080
But let's say you just have some background information that you actually don't need to

68
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.260
be as detailed as the rest of your landscape.

69
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.300
Maybe you want to give them a particular material that's a little bit more performant and simpler.

70
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.100
So in order to actually edit that, what we'd want to do is select the sections that we

71
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.100
want to edit.

72
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.720
Say in this case for this mountain range, we'd select this last three rows of components

73
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.280
and go ahead and select them.

74
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.780
And what we'd want to do is essentially override the material.

75
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.280
So if I said override, I can go ahead and override a material, add a new element here.

76
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.640
And I'm just going to give this a new lot index of one.

77
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.820
And I can now add, for example, a material that's a little bit more performant and simpler

78
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.820
than what we have.

79
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.000
So I'm just going to use a background material.

80
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.900
And now what we have is a landscape component that's using a different material to the rest

81
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900
of the landscape.

82
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.300
And as I say, this can be really handy to essentially relieve some of the complexity

83
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.520
of the landscape in areas that the player doesn't really need to access or don't need

84
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520
high detail.

85
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.000
And the cool thing about this is that you can set up as many LOD indexes as you need

86
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.280
and you can actually sort of ramp that detail intensity away from the player or the playable

87
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280
space.

88
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.520
So that's a really sort of real world case scenario of how you'd use the manage tool

89
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.760
to edit the landscape components themselves.

90
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.620
So with that being said, I think we'll go ahead and take a look at creating landscapes

91
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.200
and how we can create a landscape from height maps and different landscape creation modes

92
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.840
that we can use.
