00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Hello, and welcome to another Unreal Engine training course.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.320
My name's James Burton, and today we're

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.880
going to be taking a look at advanced landscape creation.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.040
Just to give you an outline of what the course actually

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.800
entails, we'll first be taking a look

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.400
at landscape technical details, which

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.080
will allow us to essentially understand

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.600
what's going on under the hood and what

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640
each section and each component of the landscape tool

10
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.360
actually is.

11
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.520
Then we're going to be taking a look at the landscape

12
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.240
management so that we can actually edit our landscape

13
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.600
and our components.

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.180
And throughout the whole course, we'll

15
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.600
be taking a look at how we create the new landscapes,

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.560
and also we'll take a look at how to create landscapes

17
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840
on the high map itself.

18
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.400
So let's go ahead and dive right in and take a look

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.840
at some landscape technical details.
