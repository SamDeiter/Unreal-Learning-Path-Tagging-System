  "text": " Now before we jump into creating our landscape material, I want to quickly talk about the landscape material slope. Now in this example here, we have taken a landscape material and broken it down to its just basic components so that we can highlight what is going on. And the landscape slope function works like this. When the slope or the angle of the terrain is between 0 and 0.5 degrees, we're going to show grass and then as we start to hit that 0.5, we're going to slowly start to fade into dirt. And we can see that right here. We have grass and then it's fading into dirt. Now as that dirt angle goes from 0.5 all the way to 1, we're then going to go from dirt into rock. And the coolest thing about this is again, as we lay out our terrain or we raise it or we lower it or we add features, instead of having to go in and repaint stuff, the material takes care of this for us automatically. And this is a huge time saver because it allows us to spend more time manipulating the terrain and less time worrying about going back in and fixing things once we've done those manipulations. Thank you for watching!",
