  "text": " Understanding how Unreal Engine 5 projects are structured is very important as Unreal Engine 5 projects are set up in a slightly different way than you might be used to in traditional applications. This is because in a traditional application, you generally use a single project file to visualize your scene. So when we're inside of Photoshop and we save, we're going to save it to a .psd. If we're inside of Word and we save, we're going to save to the .doc or the same for Maya if we save, we're going to save to the .mb format. Now, Unreal has a slightly different approach to this. When you're inside of Unreal Engine 5 and you want to import something such as a model, a texture, audio or animations, all of that is going to be stored in the content folder and use a .umap file format. There are two other file formats that we should be aware of. The first one is the level file format. This is called the .umap file format, and this is for any levels that we happen to be saving. And levels is a term for what we place actors or our content and we light, and it's what the end user ends up seeing in your project. Now, if we are creating, say, a material or editing an asset inside of Unreal, whatever we're doing inside of there is going to be saved again in the .uasset file format. Again, if we are importing something such as a static mesh or maybe a texture, whatever we export will be done as, say, a .fbx or .png. And when we bring that into Unreal, that's going to be imported and then saved as this .uasset file format. Now, here is an example of an Unreal Engine project folder. And you'll notice quite a few different folders in here. Don't worry. A lot of these folders are actually auto generated and can be deleted in case you need to either share your project with someone else or you run into an issue and you kind of want to start fresh. We can actually do that. So let's go ahead and take a look at what these folders are now. So right down here we have our .u project. This is going to associate Unreal Engine to run. And when we click on this, it's going to say, hey, I want you to load Unreal Engine, but I want you to load the engine and all of the content that is created inside of this folder right here. Now, above that, we have the valley of the ancients .png. This is our thumbnail that represents what we'll see inside of the Unreal Engine launcher that's associated with our project. Then we have source. So this is going to contain any of our C++ code that we might run custom for this particular project. And this is a file that you need to keep. So never delete your source. Now, saved contains saved information. And this can be a whole bunch of different things. One of the things that you'll find in here are, say, screenshots. You'll also find crash dumps. You'll find build data. One of the things you can do with saved is you can actually delete this folder should you ever need to maybe free up some space or something like that. This is a safe folder to delete. It will automatically be recreated once your project has been relaunched. Now, your plugins folder contains any plugins that you might have either purchased or created specifically for this particular project, or maybe there are plugins that you have set up so that you can share content in between your projects. The plugins folder is not safe to delete, as doing so could actually reduce functionality that your project needs. You need to keep that folder at all times. Your intermediates folder is where things like shader compilation data, builds, partially completed compilations, and other things like that are stored. This is a bunch of just miscellaneous data in here. This folder can be safely deleted should you be running into any issues, as it will automatically be recreated once the engine has been relaunched. Your derived data cache is a folder that contains pre-compiled versions of your shaders, and this allows the engine to run much, much quicker. I shouldn't say run. I apologize. It allows it to load much, much quicker. You can delete your derived data cache, but I suggest that you don't, as this will greatly affect your loading times. Next is our content. So the content is where all of our content, our .uassets and our .umaps files live. We always need to keep the content folder that's not safe to delete that folder, or you'll be deleting all of the content for your project. Next we have our config. Config is where we store all of our config information, and this will control how the editor starts or what settings are used when the game is loaded. You should not be deleting the config folder as you need that information for when the editor starts or when your game launches. Next we have our build. This is where we are going to temporarily store builds that we have done for our projects. It is safe to delete your builds folder. This folder can actually grow quite large, so if your project is all of a sudden taking up too much space, you might want to delete this folder. It will be recreated when Unreal Engine restarts. And then last but not least, we have our binaries. This is going to be created should you have any binaries that you want to have for your project. If you don't see this folder, that's okay. I believe it was created after the fact, but you can delete this folder without any issues. Now if we dive into one of these folders, we're going to look at something like this. So here we are. We're looking at the attenuations, and this is basically notice that there are all UAsset files here, and we're just looking at one folder here. Now while I am visualizing this inside of Windows Explorer, one thing I want to note is that you should never mess with files outside of Unreal. So let's say that we did want to maybe take all of these attenuation files, maybe make a new folder and split half of them or some other organizational thing that we want to do. We should never ever ever do that outside of Unreal Engine 5. We should always do that inside of the editor using the editor renaming and moving functionalities that are provided in there. Now, with all of these great files and everything, there can be some bottlenecks. And traditionally, in older versions of Unreal, whenever you wanted to make a change to anything, you would need to make that change inside of our UMAP. Now, the problem with this is that the UMAP folder was, or I should say the UMAP file is unique and only one person can have it checked out at one time. And this means that whenever I want to make a change to it, I either have to wait for somebody else to finish making their changes or come up with a complex way to work on my stuff and then somehow merge it with theirs later on. And this can create a lot of conflicts, especially as teams start to grow in size. With Unreal Engine 5, we've introduced a new file system called One File Per Actor, which reduces overlaps between users. And it does this by saving data, for instance, of actors in external files. And this actually removes the need to save everything to the UMAP file. So instead of everything being saved to the UMAP file, it's now linked to the UMAP file. And this will allow multiple people to be working in the same world, all adding and adjusting things without worrying about whether or not somebody has something checked in or checked out. Now, just a couple of things to note about One File Per Actor. It is recommended that you do use Unreal Engine 5 source control when you enable this, because it is going to involve a lot more files than you might be used to, because remember, we're going to be making a file for pretty much everything that you see that's placed inside of the level. With that said, you should also be utilizing the built-in editor check-in and check-out tools to help check your data in, check your data out. And last but not least, remember that using One File Per Actor is meant to work in tandem with world partition. So using it outside of this system might result in some unintended uses or unforeseen edge cases. So just be on the lookout for that.",
