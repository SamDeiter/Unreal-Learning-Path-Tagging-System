  "text": " So in this next section, we're going to talk about tracking solutions and the creation of rigid body objects. This is required for tracking. So as we go through here, we are going to talk specifically about the OptiTrack motive system, but I'm not going to demonstrate this because there is plenty of documentation on the respective websites for the actual vendor that provides these tracking solutions. So I just want to point out here that there are active and passive options that are available out here. So the 209 group, we use the mine at the latte stage. It is an active camera tracking unit. You can just visit the 209 group to purchase this, although there's probably going to be some of a wait time for this particular tool set. There is also the option of just using passive markers and creating your own Sputnik, much like the Epic Games custom Sputnik that was created by Kevin Cushing. This system is passive, so it doesn't have the battery requirements. But again, because it's not an active system, it's not quite as accurate or can be not as accurate as the active tracking system. However, because it doesn't require batteries and it doesn't require any kind of power supply, it can last much longer than our active systems. Now we also have the option of using an OptiTrack puck as a tracking unit or the Vive tracker. Vicon also has several options as well for passive marker systems. If you're using a custom Sputnik, that would work in both the Vicon and the OptiTrack systems because it is a passive system and markers are typically universal. So the Vive tracker, the Vive Mars tracking system, those will also work that as well. Now any tracked object in CG model can be created to suit your needs. The process includes adding calibration points that are set up correctly on the CG model to match the tracked object and that the Latte stage and lab use an OptiTrack puck for nodal point calibration. The checkerboard is not required for nodal point calibration. So the checkerboard we created in the last class is not necessary for nodal point calibration, but it is required for your lens distortion mapping. Now the Latte stage, as I mentioned, does use the OptiTrack motive system and we will provide anyone who is using the OptiTrack system with the CG model that we created for the OptiTrack puck. It has a little bump, so it's not exactly matching the OptiTrack puck, but that little bump is just that you know the front of the puck versus the back of the puck. Now as I go through and look at my nodal point, again, we are going to provide you with the OBJ and FBX that you can use in here. You can actually bring this into any system, so if you have a tracked object in the motive system or in the Shogun system, you can use this in both. It is just an FBX, it is just an OBJ. You have these, this mesh was created in Autodesk Maya. However, this is not going to match Vicon's tracking puck or their active tracker. That system is going to look a little bit different than what you have here. Now the nodal point of a physical camera is the point where light rays converge in a lens. And in order to calculate the nodal offset that will be applied to the center camera, a series of tracked objects need to be created that match the physically tracked object that is in use by the tracking solution such as OptiTrack's motive. Now again, we start with our CG model here. This OptiPuck track object is what is going to go into two different locations. So the OBJ version is going to go into OptiTrack motive, and that is what we are going to use to create a rigid body. And then the FBX version is going to go into Unreal Engine. And we will talk about actually putting that together in Unreal Engine. However, the nodal object that we're going to be creating for the tracked object in OptiTrack motive, we're not actually going to go through creating a tracked object is something that you can look up on OptiTrack's website and follow their documentation as well. But we are going to briefly discuss this by taking a look at the slides here, which walks you through some steps inside motive to select your track markers from your puck itself, create your tracked object, and then make adjustments. Now additionally, you are going to need to tweak the position of the puck so it is lined up correctly so that the alignment for the OBJ does match as close as possible to the markers that are streaming in here because we want to be able to match and line up the dimensions of the physical object and CG model to our tracked object. So that's it for creating your tracked objects. Next, we're going to talk about creating our tracked object in Unreal Engine. And again, we are using the OptiTrack motive system and the two objects that we have here available to us.",
