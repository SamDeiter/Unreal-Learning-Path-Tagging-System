  "text": " In order to do the coding for this lock, first thing I'm going to do is delete the three defaults that we have because we're not going to need these at all. Actually the only event that we're going to need is going to come off of the box collision here. So if you select the box collision and come down to the events, let's select on component begin overlap. Now this will trigger as soon as the actor overlaps with the box collision. Now what we're going to want to do is select and talk to a specific door and tell it to unlock at the point that it is it is overlapped. Now the first thing that we need is the ability to select that specific door and and effect the details on it. In order to connect with that door, we're going to use a variable. So if you come down to the variables and push plus variable, and if we bring up a new variable, let's call this connected door. Now the moment this variable is a Boolean type, however, what we're actually looking for is a actor reference. So if you type in BP underscore door, you can see that you can see that we have we it brings up the specific class that we've created. And within this class, we have a an object reference. So what this is going to do is this one here, object reference. This is going to allow you to save a reference to a specific instance of this actor inside the level. There's one more thing that we need to do, because rather than having to use some kind of complicated script to try and figure out which door it's connected to, we're going to just take instance editable here. You see the little icon on here. And then we're going to set the reference within the level itself on this specific instance. OK, so let's drag in this reference to the connected door and drop it down. And we need to get the information. So let's select and get. Now this reference here, if we were to pull up, this is going to allow us access to all of the variables and functions which are on this actor. So this here, this script is acting as if it is done within that actor itself. So to start with, we want to do a branch to check to see if the door is is already locked. So let's go in and do a get is the door unlocked. And that's going to bring up a get node, much in the same way that it would do here and this variable here. But we are pulling it from the separate actor. Now, if I was to, let's do a branch now to check to see if this door is is locked. And there you can see we have a branch condition determining if the door is locked or not. If the door is unlocked, it's going to go down true. And if the door is locked, it's going to go down false. What we want to do is if it is false, we want to set that variable to make it on. So again, this is work that needs to be done on the connected door. So if we pull off here, and rather than getting, let's set this variable now. OK. And so we're going to set it on false and we want to unlock it. So that's going to set the door is unlocked. Now, this is all the code that we need. But just at the point of overlapping, it's going to check the connected door. And if that door is locked, it's going to set it to unlock. So let's say compile. And if we go back into the level here and we drag a reference to the BP lock into the level, just going to rotate it so that it's facing us. And just one more bit. So this level. OK. Now, under the details on the right hand side here, you can see that we've now got connected door as a reference. So this is going to allow me to either do a drop down, which is going to show me the different doors which were in the level, or next to it is a small pipette. And this is going to allow me to physically select the door here and then it's going to save this reference. So let's check, let's make sure this door is locked to start with. And let's give this a go. I will save current. Lay. Now, if I come up to this door and I press E, nothing happens. However, if I go over and I break the collision here and go back to the door and press E, the door is now able to open and close.",
