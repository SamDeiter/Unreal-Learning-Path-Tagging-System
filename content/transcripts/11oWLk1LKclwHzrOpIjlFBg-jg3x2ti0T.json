  "text": " So as previously mentioned, Unreal has its own implementation of the C++11, I think, smart pointer library. It's worth just going into a little bit. So anytime you have non-new objects that you want to have the memory managed for you in some way, smart pointers are definitely something to consider. You're probably already familiar with smart pointers from more C++ if that's something you've used before, but just to kind of briefly go through them. We have TsharedPointer, which is essentially a reference counted pointer. So as this reference is copied around and passed around, we keep track of how many things have access to that pointer. As that number of references hits zero, then that memory is freed. So we don't have to worry, it's kind of shared ownership of this pointer. TUniquePointer is kind of the opposite of that, where we say one thing manages this memory. As and when this thing stops referencing it, we're going to free that memory just automatically. And TweakPointer is when we say this pointer doesn't manage that memory at all. It is conscious that that memory might get cleaned up underneath it. It's really helpful for things like lambdas that might get executed, and you're aware that execution may occur after the objects it's referencing are already deleted for other reasons. So a weak pointer is a way you can say, I'm not sure if this object still exists, but if it does, I want to perform some functions on it or something like that. So those are the kind of standard C++ smart pointer library types that you would be aware of. And then we also have two additional ones. We have TsharedRef, which is the relationship from pointer to ref, where a ref is essentially a promise that this can never be null. The same thing applies for a TsharedRef, it's just in the shared pointer library. And last of all, we have TweakObjectPointer. Whereas the rest of these are intended for non-U object types, TweakObjectPointer provides the same functionality as TweakPointer, but specifically for U object types. So whenever that same concept, again, the first thing I think of is lambdas. Whenever you're passing a reference to a U object, you're aware that U object might be gone by the time that lambda executes, TweakObjectPointer is a thing to consider using. So the benefits of the smart pointers, largely the same as C++ smart pointer benefits. So if you're not aware of them, helps prevent memory leaks. That's a really, really common one. That's why they were introduced in the first place. Unlike U objects, where it's highly recommended you don't access them off the game thread, the smart pointer library, particularly shared pointers, can be thread safe. It's worth the highlight that there are two options when you create a shared pointer. It can be a thread safe shared pointer, or it can be non-thread safe. The thread safe pointer has its reference counting done by an atomic operation, which essentially is an operation that occurs between threads. So there's no way that two threads can end up in a race condition for how many things are referencing this object. That's beneficial for thread safety, but it does come at a certain performance cost, so it's just worth bearing that in mind. The last thing is obviously the runtime safety of TsharedRef, which is very useful. The other thing to point out is obviously this is an implementation of the C++ standard smart pointer library, but the reason we recommend using Unreal's implementation of these things is its platform agnostic. So when it comes to actually something that implements or makes use of this shared pointer library, it's worth highlighting if it's from a non-reflected type, we need to inherit from the TsharedThis class. So this is what an example implementation of that would look like. We have some class, then we inherit from TsharedThis, and this is a generic implementation, so we need to provide the class that we're implementing as the argument there for the generic function. And what this does is it gives us access to a suite of functions. We have makeShared and makeShareable, which are basically two ways of creating a shared reference for this type. makeShared is encouraged to be used over makeShareable because it's slightly more performant. And then asShared and sharedThis basically just give us a shared ref to that type, but it's expecting that type is already created. And then these are all about getting access to a shared ref, and once we have that shared ref, we can easily dereference that into a Tshared pointer to then pass around if you don't want that runtime null checking safety. So that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you found it useful. If you did, please like, share, and subscribe. Thank you for watching.",
