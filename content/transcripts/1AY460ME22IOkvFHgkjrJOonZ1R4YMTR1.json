  "text": " In this video, we'll look at utilizing the packaged build of the project to understand better how OSC functions. When you look at the extracted folder that came with this project, you'll look in the packaged folder and find that there's an executable file, as well as two batch files. Now to start, if you just want to test sending what we call one-way communication, where the sender is sending data and being received by another computer, all you need to do is open up the sender batch file and change the receiver IP address to the local IPv4 address of the computer you're on right now. Using IP config as June demonstrated earlier, you'll then find that with two instances open on the same computer or two computers on the same local network, you'll find that whoever has the sender batch file opened will be able to affect the scene, changing both the scale of the cubes, whether they're on and off, or the colors of them. If you would like to use the packaged builds and test two-way functionality, if you're on the same subnet on the same local area network, you'll just need to make sure that both the sender IP and receiver IP is set up. And again, on a local subnet, you can just use the IPv4 addresses that show up when you type in IP config on each computer. However, if you want to make sure that this will work over the internet, then you will actually need to utilize using something like what's my IP address in Google to find out what the WAN is for your actual IP. And then that data would be put into here, alongside making sure that your port forwarding has already been completed to open up communication between those two computers across different networks. Please also ensure that the final launch parameter dash OSC two-way is set to equal true. Otherwise, it will still be set up to only send data in one direction. So now on the screen, we're seeing that the right hand side is my local computer in my apartment and on the left side, we're running this app on a office computer. So now we can see that when the office computer is controlling the pink bar, we see a lot of the print strings. It's just saying that I received a message. The address is float slash Z and the value. And if I do it is also printing on the other side. So that's how we can make sure. Well, and also the pink bar moves with the location. So that's how we can confirm we're receiving the messages. So now if I change the color of the cubes, it will also change on the other side. And as you can see, all these are not happening inside a multiplayer session. So we are just like we are only controlling the cubes, but not replicating actors or. Sorry, but not replicating the character movements. So we can be very selective about what are the things we want to communicate and what are not. We have the Boolean Boolean messages here, integer messages here. Oh, it's off. And a float message from here. And because this is set up for two way communication right now, I also have the same capabilities as June does. So I am also able to do things like change color or turn the cubes off and on.",
