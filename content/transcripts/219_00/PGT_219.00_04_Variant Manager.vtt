00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The next tool we're going to talk about is the Variant Manager.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.360
We'll do a quick take on this and show you exactly how to get started with it and how

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
many cool things you can do with it to really help with your production and to be able to

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.720
help some of the people such as your art director or your director decide where they want to

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.640
place things in the world quickly and easily.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.400
So one of the reasons to use it is to manage multiple assets at the same time with changes.

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.400
This can include rotation, scale, movement, color and multiple different aspects of this

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.400
object.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
And you'll see that list when I pull it up.

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
It's really a lot to name but you'll see that you really have a lot of control with this

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
tool.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.520
One thing before we get started I want to mention is you have to be aware that if you

13
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.760
are moving assets around in a virtual production that your light needs to be movable in some

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
way.

15
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.200
And that way if you are moving things around you don't necessarily have to do a full bake.

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.160
So if it's movable, if you add an asset or change an asset, Unreal won't get confused

17
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.560
with your shadows and that movable light can update on the fly.

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.920
This can also be set with ray tracing but again your systems need to support that efficiently

19
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760
and for the highest quality that you can get.

20
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.720
Alright so let's actually look at what we can do.

21
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120
One of the first things we want to do is go to miscellaneous and then we want to set in

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.640
a level variant set.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.200
And that's what we're going to do right now.

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600
So in here I just have a blank scene.

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
I just pulled in a house from our structures folder.

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320
Just slap that in here.

27
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.120
And I'm going to go in here and just right click and I'll just do it here for now and

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120
that's fine.

29
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.600
I'm going to go in here and go to my miscellaneous tab.

30
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.800
In my miscellaneous tab we're going to go to our level variant sets and open that up.

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:05.320
We'll call this level variant so LV underscore house set 01 and we'll double click on it.

32
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.840
In here we want to click on the variant set.

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.040
So this is going to give us our first set.

34
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.680
This is basically kind of a grouping method.

35
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.100
It's going to now be ready to be populated.

36
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.020
And I'm going to hit the plus button and in here this will make us our new variant.

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.800
Now you can also just right click and say hey man let's add a variant or you can just

38
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.820
hit that add button and that makes your life easier.

39
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.660
With this object selected in our scene I easily just go in here right click and add selected

40
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.660
actors.

41
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.060
This could be multiple actors or just one or whatever you choose you can add the actor

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.300
here.

43
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Now you'll see instantly when I add that actor we have so many different things that we can

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.220
choose from to be able to actually change this actor on the fly.

45
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.900
If you want to change the material if you want to change mobility all these things are

46
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.340
in here is a dynamic or not all these things are available in here which is really really

47
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.340
convenient.

48
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.820
It's specifically if you need to change positioning on an object or material quickly you can actually

49
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.940
and the art director be able to see the changes suggested and what is available at their fingertips

50
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.220
to be able to get the scenes that they need and want.

51
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.220
So in here what we're going to be messing with is mainly the relative location the relative

52
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.460
rotation and the relative scale.

53
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.860
That's mainly what we're going to be messing with here.

54
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.060
So we make sure we have those active.

55
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.220
Now this is going to make it so that our static mesh we can control its positioning anywhere.

56
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.620
We can choose material and a few others but we won't go through all of these.

57
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.620
They're pretty straightforward.

58
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.100
So I'm going to hit select.

59
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.860
Now this object in our 3D space with it selected I can go in here and just you know try to

60
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.700
place it and put it in the right spot.

61
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.940
Now what happens is a recording feature happens.

62
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.820
You see this little dot active.

63
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.860
If I move this around get this in the right spot that I need and I can click on this and

64
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.020
you'll now see a little on the whole set of our regular translation rotation and scale

65
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.060
that shows up in details will populate here.

66
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.060
Sometimes it'll need a little refresh.

67
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.020
You'll notice I clicked on it moved around a little bit click on it again.

68
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.020
It'll pop up.

69
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.460
So now that it's populated I can keep this in here.

70
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.100
It's going to record that positioning but maybe I want to show the director a different

71
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.880
type of position for this.

72
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.320
So I can right click in here and duplicate that object and control W will do the same.

73
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.560
And in here I now have this same geometry I double clicked on it active in this slot

74
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.920
here and I can choose that position.

75
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.960
I can move this position.

76
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.760
I can rotate it just a tad and I can hit these two recording of those changes here.

77
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.600
You'll see a little arrow with a flat kind of rectangular white icon pointing to it.

78
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.240
So record that and record that change.

79
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.760
So now when your director looks at your stage and says hey man that looks great but you

80
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.560
been talking to the storyboard artist the concept artist and there's a few different

81
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.720
things he wasn't maybe he couldn't quite make his decision on the art director or the

82
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.740
director and you can now show them the switching between these.

83
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.180
So I can click on this position that we've already have set in the defaults and then

84
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.020
the new one that we rotated and we can keep duplicating these.

85
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.180
We can keep making more with different positioning and this is allowing me to shuffle between

86
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.780
these and this is what I meant by making sure that your light is movable for the fact that

87
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.260
your shadow won't have to be set and you have to marry to a particular positioning of your

88
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
shadow you'll just have that movable so as you flip through these different pieces of

89
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.020
the model you're not going to have to re-bake every single time.

90
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.020
Those are things to keep in mind when using this tool.

91
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.540
You can see quickly we're switching between these and again this can be through material

92
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.860
this can be all sorts of different dependencies in here and you saw the full list that you

93
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.580
can do and this makes the variant manager really powerful and really great especially

94
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.660
if you want to be able to show different varieties of layout and set dressing for a virtual production.
