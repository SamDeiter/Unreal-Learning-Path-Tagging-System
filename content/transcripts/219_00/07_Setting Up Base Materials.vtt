00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640
In this video, we're going to talk about setting up base materials and how we can get that

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.160
foundation down and make sure that's a doorway to be able to create instance materials, which

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.960
is going to help with our overall draw calls and overhead for our scenes.

4
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.520
So let's get started.

5
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.120
Some of the topics we're going to cover is a simple material setup and instancing those

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.680
materials.

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.600
First up, let's go and take a look at our spire material that we have set up and how

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
we can actually open up some of these parameters to be able to have full control of how they

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
look and feel.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.520
And we'll keep this pretty simple because we do have a materials class, but this for

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.040
the most part just reminds you of the theory and the practice of this and how this actually

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.700
will help your overall scenes.

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.200
So let's go and take a look at this in Unreal.

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.420
So in our Unreal scene here, we have our spire here that we can play with.

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.020
So let's go and take a look at his material.

16
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.220
I'm going to double click on this material.

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.980
And we keep these concepts pretty simple, but so that you understand why and the purpose

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.980
of this.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.900
So you'll see that we have a specular.

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.980
He's always going to be active and set to a 0.5.

21
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.620
The one thing you do need to keep in mind when working with a specular material is it

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.060
can interfere with the strength of your roughness.

23
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.020
So sometimes just lowering this to a simple zero can be kind of helpful.

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.260
So all your texture information, as in your roughness and surface information is pulled

25
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.740
from your roughness texture or whatever number of variables you're working with.

26
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.600
Now this is the material editor.

27
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.220
At this point, you should be familiar with this concept, as in, excuse me, with this

28
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.640
tool and how it works.

29
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.900
And in here, you'll see that we have several different modes for our material.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.860
I'm just clicking right here, left clicking in the grid.

31
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.380
You can see that you can choose whether it's a simple surface, defer decal, light function,

32
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.020
volume, post-process.

33
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.660
Those are actually pretty heavy lifters in changing the dependencies of how this material

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.820
is going to look.

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.540
And also we have a blend mode, which will allow us to even push further how our visuals

36
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.860
are going to be for our material.

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.060
So we're going to keep things pretty simple.

38
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
We're going to have a surface opaque default lit.

39
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.060
All that's good.

40
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.180
Now remember, as you change things, such as turn things and make them more translucent,

41
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580
they can't get expensive.

42
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.540
So keeping your materials in mind of exactly what you want, what your output is, is really

43
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.500
important because as your material gets more complicated, such as with translucency, things

44
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140
can get expensive.

45
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.240
Now what we can do to maybe help that out a bit, because the draw calls look at each

46
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.480
one of your materials, is we can help out those draw calls a bit with some instancing.

47
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.360
And instancing can be very helpful.

48
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.200
Now you can have multiple instances off a parent or master mold material.

49
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.240
You can have multiple instances derived from it.

50
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.400
And you can have it so like there's 50, you can even go as far as 100.

51
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040
That's a limitation based on your GPU.

52
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.520
But to be able to do that, to open this up, to open this master material, master mold

53
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.320
To open it up, to be able to do that, we have to actually open up our parameters.

54
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.520
So we have to go to each one of these textures, right click it here, and do a thing called

55
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.960
convert to parameter.

56
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.540
And we'll call this the albedo.

57
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.360
And when you create these, you can also have the option when you open up these parameters

58
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.760
to add a group.

59
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.200
So we can call this the albedo.

60
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.320
And I'm keeping this pretty simple.

61
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.280
In the most part, what we might want to do is maybe introduce a multiply.

62
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.080
In that multiply, we maybe have a scalar parameter, which is a more upgraded version of this constant

63
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.400
parameter here.

64
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.800
To get there, you can either right click a constant parameter and convert to a parameter.

65
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.960
Then we'll change it to a scalar parameter.

66
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.360
Or simply keep your finger on the S key and the left click and you'll create a scalar

67
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.680
parameter.

68
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.520
And then in here, we could call this a, you know, I'm going to maybe change the color

69
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.240
output of this individual texture.

70
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.200
Maybe introduce a three constant vector.

71
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200
This will be for color.

72
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.120
We can keep it black and we can pull this albedo in here.

73
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.480
You can get a preview what it's going to look like.

74
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.960
You can see if we right click, start preview mode, you can see that we're all black.

75
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.840
So you have to watch out between add and multiply what you're going to get.

76
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.600
And in this case, we would set this to white.

77
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.360
And they'll see your color information come through.

78
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.180
And if you wanted to, let's stop that preview.

79
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.880
We can control maybe how strong that's going to be.

80
00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:01.920
So with this multiply in place, we can maybe pull in the strength of that albedo.

81
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.560
By temporarily disconnecting this, moving this over here.

82
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.160
Simply make another multiply.

83
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.560
Put this in here.

84
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.280
This in here.

85
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.680
And then connect that right here.

86
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.240
And you'll see that it's dark at first, right?

87
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.280
So this parameter, we can set that to one or even higher if we wanted to.

88
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.280
And let's add this to the base.

89
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.120
And you'll see now it's still a bit dark, right?

90
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.840
Not quite exactly what we're looking for.

91
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.920
So as you increase your multiply, you'll see that it's going to magnify things.

92
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.440
So the nice thing about working with a scalar, we can keep things within a range.

93
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.440
So I can say, hey, man, I want my default to be 10.

94
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440
I want my slider.

95
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.680
Or actually, that might be too strong.

96
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.640
We'll do like maybe a five.

97
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640
And I want my slider minimum to be zero and my maximum to be five.

98
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.360
So this all depends how you want to pull this through.

99
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.160
But this gives you the magnification based on whatever color you've chosen.

100
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.520
And that's one way you can do it.

101
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.680
So there's multiple ways.

102
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.240
And whenever you make these, make sure you comment them out.

103
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.480
So you can say, hey, I want to comment this right here.

104
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
We'll leave the C key.

105
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.240
We'll leave this guy out just temporarily.

106
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.760
And we'll just say here, color experiments.

107
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.920
And there's multiple ways to actually match this up.

108
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.800
I just did this super generically.

109
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.520
And in our classes, you'll see me talk about, as well as other instructors,

110
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.480
how to set this up.

111
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.920
And this is just a quick way.

112
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.480
You could even just add.

113
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.120
But this multiply and add kind of act a little bit like Photoshop,

114
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.200
allowing us to stack.

115
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.240
But you have to keep in mind what kind of color output you're going to get.

116
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.400
And you can get that through a preview by right clicking,

117
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.080
which you saw me do just a minute ago for previews and so forth.

118
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.600
We could even lower this to maybe two if we wanted.

119
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.320
That's too dark.

120
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320
Let's do something like that.

121
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.920
Or four.

122
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.520
There we go.

123
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.360
That's fine.

124
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.080
All right.

125
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.000
So that gives you a little bit of control.

126
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.800
Gives you an idea of how that works.

127
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.000
And you can also keep it simple.

128
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.800
This just depends on how much control you want of this object.

129
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.200
But if we are going to do this, again, we have to actually open up the parameters.

130
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.400
Convert that to a parameter.

131
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.640
Call this color overlay.

132
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.360
And we've got to put them in a group.

133
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840
We're going to put them in that albedo group.

134
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.600
Do the same thing with the scalar parameter.

135
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.960
Want to give it a name, though.

136
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.680
We'll call this intensity color.

137
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.560
So color intensity.

138
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.160
Let's just put that there.

139
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.320
And just put that into an albedo group.

140
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.120
And then again, we want to open up each one of these.

141
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.800
Convert to a parameter.

142
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.080
Rough.

143
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.360
Yes.

144
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.880
And normally, you could put a multiply in here.

145
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.240
And you can choose scalar parameter.

146
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.640
I'll do this slightly quickly here.

147
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.720
Rough intensity.

148
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.040
Because you should have had these classes at this point.

149
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040
Move that in there.

150
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.760
We'll set his limitation to.

151
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.960
And you can cheat a little bit.

152
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.880
Because when it comes to roughness, it's typically a 0 to 1.

153
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.560
That's really how it works.

154
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.720
But you can cheat a little bit with Unreal.

155
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.280
If we introduce a multiply, we can go a little bit higher.

156
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.640
And I actually like to work with a little bit higher numbers.

157
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.160
Instead of getting carpal tunnel and typing in 0.00.5,

158
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.760
that's the intensity I'm looking for.

159
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.640
You can cheat when it comes to the multiply

160
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.280
in this particular case.

161
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.520
And metallic, not so much.

162
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.560
So I'm going to go in here and put a 10.

163
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.760
We'll do a 5 as default. If we want to increase that,

164
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.720
we can set the minimum to 0 and maximum to 10.

165
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240
So then we can go higher.

166
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080
That's there.

167
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.760
And we probably have to mute this a bit,

168
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.920
because it's probably still too high.

169
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.840
But that's fine.

170
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.600
And we just set that to roughness there.

171
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.640
And we also have ambient occlusion.

172
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.240
We'll leave that.

173
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.360
We'll leave normal.

174
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.880
Now, normal, if you want to control this,

175
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.160
is a little bit counterintuitive artist-wise.

176
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.800
But what you want to do is use a flatten normal.

177
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.080
Sometimes I'll be lazy in my flatten normal.

178
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.320
I'll just simply put in a scalar and flatten this.

179
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.800
But the only problem is it works in a negative space.

180
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.160
So it gets a little weird.

181
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.480
So we'd have to actually flip that so it goes back

182
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.200
to a positive.

183
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.920
So since this works in an opposite direction,

184
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.240
so negative is pushing forward the way you maybe

185
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.480
have intended it, going positive numbers goes negative,

186
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.560
that's going to be counterintuitive.

187
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.920
So you have to actually use a 1 minus node.

188
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.000
Back, there it is.

189
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240
I literally typed a node.

190
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.520
And I can put that in my flatness here.

191
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.320
And I would connect this to my scalar parameter.

192
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.160
And we'll call it normal intensity.

193
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320
And I keep in this pretty basic.

194
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.720
Regularly, you would create a whole UV set

195
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.360
where you can control how many times the UVs are tiling.

196
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.200
In this case, since UV is very specific with his UVs,

197
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.680
we probably should do that.

198
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.000
Otherwise, you could really ugly fast.

199
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.440
But if you have a more encompassing texture

200
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.280
that is more generic and not really dependent on UVs,

201
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.080
you can actually play with that a bit more.

202
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.760
So I'm going to go and move this to the normal.

203
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.720
And in that normal, we bring that into the normal.

204
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.600
And in that normal, we bring that into the normal space

205
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.400
there.

206
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
There we go.

207
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.040
And again, we can control the intensity.

208
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.800
In this case, we can set the intensity to, say, 5

209
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.800
if you want to go really strong, minimum 0.

210
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.300
And then, say, we want to invert it.

211
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.680
We could do a negative 5 for actually,

212
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.560
I did that backwards.

213
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.040
Here we go.

214
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.160
Minimum is negative 5.

215
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.800
My bad.

216
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.440
That's negative 5.

217
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.360
And the maximum is going to be just a little 5.

218
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.120
There we go.

219
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.720
Cool.

220
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.000
And if you ever wanted to bring in your geometry,

221
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.240
just make sure you select your geometry in your content

222
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.040
browser.

223
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.840
With it selected, just click on the teapot,

224
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.800
and it will load it in this viewer.

225
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.000
All right, so with this all set up,

226
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.800
we want to make sure, again, we open up the parameters.

227
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.080
And this will be a normal.

228
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.720
We're going to create a normal group.

229
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.600
And we'll just add this to the normal group, too.

230
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.120
And we'll create a roughness group.

231
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.200
Add this roughness intensity to that roughness group.

232
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.120
Also, make sure this guy is connected to the roughness

233
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.600
group.

234
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.360
There he is.

235
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.160
For some reason, I thought I didn't do that.

236
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.660
And we'll just leave Albedo by himself,

237
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.320
because nobody cares about him right now.

238
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.080
So there we go.

239
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.200
We even got commenting.

240
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.600
We got this all set up.

241
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.440
And I would hit Say.

242
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.040
So I'm just going to apply in this case

243
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.560
so I can rebuild this for another course.

244
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.000
And I'm going to pull this across here.

245
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.760
And then now I can right click this particular piece

246
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.280
of geometry.

247
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.680
It looks like it's a little bright.

248
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.480
So we can probably go over that a little bit.

249
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.080
It's all shiny.

250
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.800
I actually kind of like it.

251
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.240
But we can change that in the instance, believe it or not.

252
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.720
So we'll do that in the instance.

253
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.600
And you can see the update on the fly.

254
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.040
So let's move this off to the side.

255
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.240
I'm going to right click here.

256
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.800
And we'll do Create Material Instance.

257
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.720
And we're going to call this mi for Material Instance.

258
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.080
We go across.

259
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.160
Let's get rid of that suffix.

260
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.760
Enter.

261
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760
Open it up.

262
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.520
Now when we open this, you're automatically

263
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.040
going to notice the interface is quite different.

264
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.480
So I'm going to turn on my Albedo.

265
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.640
And that means I can switch any texture I want.

266
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.360
So maybe I'm working with this texture in Mixer, 3D Co,

267
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.080
or some other substance painter.

268
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.440
And Color Intensity, Color Overlay.

269
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.800
We got the Normal, Normal Intensity, Roughness,

270
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.040
and Rough Intensity.

271
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.360
All of this can be controlled on the fly.

272
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.360
So the Color Intensity, we can choose

273
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.800
the darkness of it if we wanted to.

274
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.400
And we can choose what color we want for it.

275
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.260
Apply.

276
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.920
And we can choose, make sure that's working here.

277
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.960
Maybe double check.

278
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.280
Got the parameter open.

279
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.640
Multiply Albedo.

280
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640
We're good.

281
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.440
Cool.

282
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.880
Go back to our real-time spire here.

283
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.880
And we're going to Control Normal Intensity.

284
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.880
We can lower the Normal Intensity or increase it.

285
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.560
Now you'll notice nothing's happening here,

286
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.680
because I forgot I have to actually apply it.

287
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.160
So let's go on to Reset.

288
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.880
And we're going to go back to the real-time spire.

289
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.480
And we're going to have to actually apply it.

290
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.680
So let's go ahead and slap it on this guy.

291
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.800
And we can control the Color Intensity.

292
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.080
Now you'll see the updates.

293
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.600
We can choose the color that we want.

294
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.760
So in this case, we'll say, hey, man,

295
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.080
I want this to be more white in nature.

296
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.000
I want to give it a little red to it.

297
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.480
There we go.

298
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.520
Green, blue.

299
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.360
I had to check my work there, because I

300
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.480
noticed that I needed to go back a little bit.

301
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.800
I thought, why isn't it working?

302
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.080
Because I have to apply it.

303
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.480
It's crazy.

304
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.520
And then you can see all the color changes here.

305
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.000
And as we change those colors, let's get something that's

306
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.760
really going to show up on screen.

307
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.320
Blood, pinkish red.

308
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.600
And we can now change the strength of that,

309
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600
which is pretty nice.

310
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.360
And even in Sequencer, if you wanted to,

311
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.280
you can open these parameters and animate this,

312
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.960
which is actually pretty cool.

313
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.360
And then we have Normal Intensity.

314
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.720
We can decrease the Normal Intensity or increase it.

315
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.560
You'll see it there.

316
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.080
We can go Negative or Positive, Inverting.

317
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.560
There's the Roughness Intensity.

318
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.040
You can see it there.

319
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.480
Working my full spectrum of my slider here.

320
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.320
And we can also choose to turn off my roughness

321
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.720
if we don't want to use it at all.

322
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.000
Decrease my roughness so there's no changes in it whatsoever.

323
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.240
And all that's available for you to play with.
