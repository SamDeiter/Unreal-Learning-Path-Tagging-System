00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
In this lesson, we're going to talk about managing levels and how we can maintain and

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.680
create an environment in which we can have better workflows.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.880
So let's get started.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.520
The topics we'll cover is editing levels and why, and separating items and how that works.

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.400
So editing levels and why.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.280
Most times when levels are simple, they can be managed in one persistent level.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.200
So oftentimes that is not the case, as others will need to edit specific items.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.160
So in your team, they may be a group of people that are working with lighting, maybe working

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.600
with the effects, maybe working with the geo.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.520
The level system in Unreal allows many people to work on a project and edit different aspects

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.480
such as lights and geo, as well as effects without interfering with other items.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.640
This system keeps things clean and easier to maintain.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.920
But many people can also get confused on the difference between layers and working with

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920
our level system.

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.760
Layers, you can think of it as a typical layer system that you would see in 3D Studio Max

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
and Maya.

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
We won't get too much into this, but it works exactly the same way where you can just manage

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.640
things more to that particular work area that you're in.

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.240
And you can populate this any way that you need.

20
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.360
But we're going to mainly focus on levels, which is a little bit more powerful because

21
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.880
here, or actually I should say quite more powerful, because here we can actually load

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.120
other levels that we've created that have separate pieces that have been built by someone

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
else.

24
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.360
Like someone could build, hey, I built this new city, this new building, these new rocks

25
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.560
and terrain, and I'm going to give you this level.

26
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
So they can immigrate that level to you.

27
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.360
And then now you may be the one person in charge or multiple people charge of assembling

28
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
this.

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.440
You can now go in here and say, hey, I'm going to now edit and add that existing level in

30
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440
here.

31
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
So you can add existing.

32
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440
And that's kind of what I did here.

33
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.600
And if you look down below, you'll see the spires level.

34
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240
It is actually loaded here.

35
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.600
And if I hit this eyeball icon, you'll see that most of those, except for a few that

36
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800
I just plopped in recently, will actually disappear.

37
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.960
So most of our spires are gone.

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.460
And that makes it a lot easier.

39
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.320
So if you're that way, you can actually bring in what someone else has worked on.

40
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.320
And at the same time, you can make some edits without affecting anybody else's stuff.

41
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.480
You can say, hey, I'm going to make this current or I'm going to work on this particular one.

42
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.340
In this case, we're working off the persistent level.

43
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.680
Now one thing I do want to mention, though, when working with levels, when it comes to

44
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.640
your lighting, make sure that your lighting, for the most part, is in your persistent level.

45
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.000
This is actually a really good practice.

46
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.440
Now is it a hard rule?

47
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Not all the time.

48
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.680
Sometimes you can nest these in a different areas, but you do want to be careful if you

49
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.060
nest them too deeply.

50
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.400
You can make it have a disconnect when it comes to like baking your lights or even working

51
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
with ray tracing.

52
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.560
So you want to be careful of that and be aware of that situation.

53
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.040
So as long as you're organized and keep things in a clean fashion and make sure you don't

54
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.560
put these things in too many sub levels, you should be OK.

55
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.480
So also I'll notice I'll point out to you when it comes to your streaming method.

56
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.120
So you change streaming method.

57
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.720
Right now we're set to blueprint.

58
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.680
That makes it easy for us to just bring this item in here.

59
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.960
If you have it always loaded, just make sure you're aware of everything that's in that

60
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
scene.

61
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.000
If there's extra lights that are in that particular level that you're bringing in, you make sure

62
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that that's removed.

63
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.520
So you're only using the lighting that's in your persistent level or whatever you're using

64
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.600
for lighting.

65
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.860
So there is no conflict.

66
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.600
So when you're baking, there isn't any weirdness going on.

67
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.740
There isn't double lights or double items.

68
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.600
So organization again is super key to this.

69
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160
You'll see right here there's a save level icon.

70
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.880
There's a save level and you also can change the level color so you can actually keep things

71
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.120
a little bit more organized as well as create new folders for any items that you want to

72
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
populate.

73
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120
So just keep those things in mind.

74
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.760
And that's really beneficial.

75
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.400
If I say I grab this select type and I said, hey, you know what?

76
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.000
I want to add that select type.

77
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.320
So just when I hit the eyeball button, everything is gone except for that.

78
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.400
I can right click and I can go to move selected actors to level so I can move that right to

79
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.920
that level if I needed to.

80
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.120
You can deselect actors.

81
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000
You can convert external level actors.

82
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.440
So there's a lot of different options here, which makes it a lot easier for you.

83
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.360
You can even lock them if you need to or even make it current.

84
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.520
Now this is important to consider these things because having this edit control is really

85
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.320
beneficial for your full production.

86
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.920
Again, you can see you can add existing and you can even create new.

87
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.520
When you create new, you literally are making a brand new scene and you can populate it

88
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520
really quickly.

89
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.200
And in that new level, you will immediately have access to it.

90
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.520
But just make sure again, housekeeping.

91
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.520
You know exactly what's in that level and what's coming into your existing production.

92
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000
So I'm going to hit cancel here.

93
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.280
And we can see again, separating items.

94
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.880
So there's two ways you can add the levels.

95
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.520
And I'll reemphasize this because it can be kind of confusing in the very beginning

96
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.120
when people try to understand how this works.

97
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.080
You select your geolights or et cetera, what you wish to separate in a persistent level

98
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.840
and go to levels, create new with selected actors.

99
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.440
You can also load other outside levels, as mentioned before, to a persistent level and

100
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.200
stream them via blueprint to call on it when needed or always loaded if you need it in

101
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.520
the level right away while you work.

102
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.840
Now the benefit of streaming levels, I'm going to point this out, of doing it through a blueprint

103
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.560
you could also cycle through levels, lighting scenarios.

104
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.120
Now most of that's a little bit geared more towards pre-visualization because most of

105
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.320
the time when you're in a virtual set, you kind of determine exactly the lighting that

106
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.840
you want because you want to make sure that everything's linking correctly.

107
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.020
And when you're flipping through your persistent level, that can be a bit of an issue.

108
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.280
So just keep that in mind.

109
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.160
But having that blueprint allows you if you did need to cycle through a lighting system,

110
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
it's not possible.

111
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.660
It just takes a bit of work.

112
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.700
You can actually do that within your environment, but it's better to change the light that you

113
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.620
have existing on that case because there's a lot more involved, especially if you're

114
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.900
working with such things as your tracking, your identifying, your linking your stage

115
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.540
to what you're doing in your Unreal environment.

116
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.300
So just keep those things in mind.

117
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
There's a lot of work involved.

118
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.840
But for the most part, you want to use your lighting.

119
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.140
So if you are deciding to do blueprint and switching between streaming levels, that leans

120
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.780
more towards pre-visualization.

121
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.700
And then when it comes to the lighting, like I mentioned before, try to keep your linings

122
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.940
not so much on the sub levels if you can.

123
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.620
Keeping it on your persistent level is a bit more ideal because then you have quick access

124
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620
to it.

125
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.980
If you run into any problems, you make sure that things are linking cleanly.

126
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.440
You're at the top level of everything.

127
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.540
And it's not a golden rule because there are ways around that.

128
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.740
It's just this is different from a game environment.

129
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.580
This is more of a virtual production environment.

130
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.580
So keep those things in mind.
