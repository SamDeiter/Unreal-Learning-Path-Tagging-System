00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860
In this video, we're going to talk about how to create a Blueprint in Unreal in which

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420
we can populate it with Static Meshes and to be able to edit them quickly and duplicate

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.540
them and make changes all across the board.

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.200
So let's get started.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.140
So first we're going to create a Blueprint Actor, and let me show you how this works.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.900
We also have a step-by-step in the notes, which takes you through some of these details.

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.560
So let's go and do that.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.680
In Unreal, we have a seed here, and we want to be able to maybe make a set of stalactites

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.320
type of objects sticking through the ground.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm probably using that word incorrectly.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.760
There's stalagmites, stalagdites, I forget which one sticks up and which one sticks down.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.080
But in this case, there are spikes.

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.720
So let's just say spikes.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.920
So these spikes, I'm going to have different versions of them, and I want to be able to

15
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.020
actually change and edit them and not only change them individually, but also maybe change

16
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.020
them all across the board.

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.940
And it's actually pretty simple to do that.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.020
Unreal itself has an amazing instancing system within it in which you can duplicate things,

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.460
and it really does look at the last one, and it allows for a quick calculation of that

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.460
object.

21
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.460
Now it does require a draw call, so many times emerging is more ideal.

22
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.700
But when we're using Blueprints, it allows us to house different items within there,

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.200
duplicate them, and maybe even change them all across the board so that Blueprint instance

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.400
is being able to affect all different ones or separate ones as you work.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
So let me show you how to do that.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400
It's actually not that difficult.

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400
So we're going to go to our Blueprints here.

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.280
I'm going to make a brand new NT Blueprint.

29
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.680
You can select an object and say, hey, I'm going to make this instantly into a Blueprint.

30
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.400
The only disadvantage you get with this is you can lose some of your scale, rotation,

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.820
and translation within how's within that Blueprint.

32
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.660
I like to be able to have the option of it still being there plus having it here within

33
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.260
the details.

34
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
So I like to do it here, do it raw.

35
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.020
So I'm going to go in and right click here, and I'm going to create a new Blueprint class.

36
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.140
We'll just choose Actor because Actor is the most diversified.

37
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.020
So if we needed to program right within this and edit it and make maybe special features,

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.900
maybe you want to control how they work, maybe you want them to be more random, we can do

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.200
so if we have an empty Actor.

40
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.720
So it allows us to use our Blueprint programming scripting language to be able to make it more

41
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
robust.

42
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720
So this is the most diversified.

43
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
So we're going to hit on Actor.

44
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:44.720
We're going to call this Blueprint underscore Spire control, and you can call it whatever

45
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960
you want if you're following along.

46
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960
So I'm going to double click on this.

47
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.040
We're going to pop this up.

48
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.560
And what we want to do is add a component.

49
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.100
So component we want to add is our Spire.

50
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.660
Unreal is pretty smart.

51
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.740
In older versions of Unreal, you would do add a component and have to hunt it down.

52
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.260
But many times if you haven't already selected, you can add a component and it'll actually

53
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.940
recognize the one that you have selected, but not all the time.

54
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.280
So sometimes there is a little bit of refresh.

55
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.020
So we'll have to do Static Mesh.

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.100
And you'll see here we can do an Static Mesh.

57
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.420
We want to do this one, not the Instance one because these are great too.

58
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.820
They just give you a lot more options.

59
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.680
If you have things already, say you've merged stuff such as a hierarchal instance Static

60
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.840
Mesh, it will actually allow you to populate it.

61
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.400
But we just want to do a Static Mesh in general.

62
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
It's fine.

63
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.080
And that works just fine because we don't have thousands of these.

64
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.020
And if we did have a ton of them, we'd want to probably lean more towards foliage at that

65
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.020
point.

66
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.020
So I'm going to go Static Mesh here.

67
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.240
I'm going to call this Spire 01.

68
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.480
And we'll hit Enter.

69
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.620
Now if we go to our, now we're not going to create anything within our Event Graph.

70
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.600
And we have that option that we can.

71
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.100
But you'll see with this Spire selected, we have a Static Mesh component ready to go.

72
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.940
If I wanted to be able to program in here some more, I can grab my Static Mesh from

73
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.900
my, say it's populated in my environment.

74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.260
And I can drag that Static Mesh reference in here if I needed to.

75
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.400
But we're not going to go that far into the weeds here.

76
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.500
So I'm going to go in here and grab that Spire.

77
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.260
I can grab any Spire that I want.

78
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.800
And I'll grab this first one here.

79
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.220
And you'll see that it's now connected within our Blueprint.

80
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.060
I'm going to go to my Viewport and we'll see that Spire is there.

81
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.060
And that's perfect.

82
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.940
That's exactly what we need.

83
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.580
So we need to actually make sure we also have the correct material for him.

84
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.380
So you'll see default material came in when we brought him in because we built this guide

85
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.400
before Mixer had the option to be able to export immediately.

86
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.560
So what we can do is grab that material that we need for this Spire.

87
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.720
And we're going to connect it to him.

88
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.080
Now we're just going to grab one in the scene.

89
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080
I'm going to hit the magnifying glass.

90
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.360
I'm going to cheat a little bit.

91
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.040
And we're going to grab this and just drag it into this particular character.

92
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.500
That's perfect.

93
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.040
So I'm cheating a little bit and that's fine just to speed things up.

94
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.000
I'm going to rotate this.

95
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's good cheating.

96
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.420
And I'm going to now hit my Spacebar.

97
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.580
And I'm going to set this rotation to a world and keep my finger on the Alt key and drag

98
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.260
and duplicate just one more within this Blueprint environment.

99
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.940
So let me hit Alt drag this through.

100
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.340
Actually I need to create another one.

101
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.340
So sorry I was thinking in the Viewport.

102
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.340
So we don't want to do that.

103
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.340
What I do here and just do another static mesh.

104
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040
So what you got not enough coffee.

105
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.320
You can grab a static mesh and we'll call this guy.

106
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.320
And we don't want this guy to be parented underneath him.

107
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.080
So we want to make it separate.

108
00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.000
We don't want to attach it in any way so we can move him and move him right on top there.

109
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.640
And it'll actually separate this.

110
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.120
Let's give it a name.

111
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.760
We'll call this static mesh 02.

112
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760
Or 02.

113
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760
That's perfect.

114
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.120
There we go.

115
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.320
And we'll move this one over.

116
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.520
Oh it's not populated yet.

117
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.540
Let's go and populate it with the same static mesh.

118
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.300
Spire I should say.

119
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.100
So what happens when you attack and move things around.

120
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.100
Grab the same material.

121
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.100
Put it in there.

122
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.100
Rotate it a bit so it looks a little bit different here.

123
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.620
I hit spacebar and accident.

124
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.620
It took into the material and that's fine.

125
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720
Let's rotate this though a little bit more.

126
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720
There we go.

127
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.720
It looks a little bit different material wise.

128
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720
Rotate that down.

129
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720
Let's scale that down a bit.

130
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.720
So let's switch that to vocal.

131
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
We'll scale that down just a tad.

132
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.720
And we'll move this one a little bit past there.

133
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.720
Make them kind of reflect on top of each other.

134
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720
And we'll do one more.

135
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
Just for the heck of it.

136
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.820
We'll do this guy here.

137
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.820
And if you need to you can also duplicate it.

138
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.820
So I just showed you how you can load them if you need it to be unique.

139
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.820
But you can also duplicate it there.

140
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.820
So with that duplication selected.

141
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.820
Then I'll move this one over.

142
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820
And that's a little bit faster.

143
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.820
But I wanted to show you that you can also load them one more time.

144
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.820
Just in case you might have missed that the first time.

145
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.820
Move that down.

146
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.820
And let's actually scale this one up.

147
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.820
Every time I look at this it reminds me of chicken fingers.

148
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.920
I'm not sure why.

149
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920
So we'll go ahead and grab this here.

150
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920
And move this up there.

151
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920
Alright so just a little quick clump of spires here.

152
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.920
We can play with.

153
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.920
Cool.

154
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920
So this fellow we can hit compile.

155
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920
We can find out where he's at by hitting browse.

156
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920
There's our new spire set.

157
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.920
That we've made.

158
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920
And this is the cool thing about the power of this.

159
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920
So I can move this spires in here.

160
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.920
And I can scale them down.

161
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.020
We can also do that within the blueprint itself.

162
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.020
So I'll just do it here.

163
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.020
Scale that down.

164
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.020
My scale's a little funky so let's go and change that real quick here.

165
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.020
Scale that down.

166
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.020
There we go. One more fluid.

167
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.020
And now I have a set of spires that I can control.

168
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.020
Let me control so you won't see it too far.

169
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.020
Set of spires that I can place in the world any way that I want.

170
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.020
I'll go to my camera here.

171
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.020
You can see it's a false set here.

172
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.020
There we go.

173
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.020
And the cool thing about this.

174
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.020
Is now I can pull this here.

175
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.020
And I can hit alt and move this over.

176
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.020
Rotate this one.

177
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.020
About one, two.

178
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.020
And we'll do this on an object basis rotation.

179
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.020
So let's do that.

180
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.020
Kind of rotate.

181
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.020
It's kind of the same thing.

182
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.020
It's all good.

183
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.120
And then we'll move this over.

184
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.120
And.

185
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.120
Go back to the world.

186
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.120
We can rotate this any way that we desire.

187
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120
Give it a little bit of a different angle.

188
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.120
And I can change these to make them individual.

189
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.120
So with this one set here I can simply go into one.

190
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.120
I can go into the blueprint itself.

191
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.120
And I can change the angle.

192
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.120
And I can change the angle.

193
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.220
And I can go into the blueprint itself.

194
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.220
And edit it here.

195
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.220
And the cool thing about this is if you want to change all of them you can.

196
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.220
So I can hit the space bar.

197
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.220
Let me move just a tad here.

198
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.220
You can see it moving real time.

199
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.220
Let me shrink this down just a little bit more.

200
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.220
So you can see this actively happening.

201
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.220
Because it's getting cut off.

202
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.220
So as I rotate this you'll see both of them change.

203
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.220
And that's actually kind of nice.

204
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.320
So if you want to say hey I need to change all of them.

205
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320
You can make a quick change for that.

206
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.320
And I can hit compile.

207
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320
And it'll update them all on the fly.

208
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.320
But the benefit also of doing this is the fact that I can go in here.

209
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.320
Select this particular blueprint.

210
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320
And I can go individually here.

211
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.320
And I can also rotate them without affecting the other ones.

212
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.320
Which is really convenient to be able to do that.

213
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.320
Scale it down and you'll notice we're keeping this blueprint still unique.

214
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.420
So you can have a bunch of these in the scene.

215
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.420
Do some quick editing.

216
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.420
And it allows you to be able to control and edit things the way that you want.

217
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.420
And this is a really great way to maintain your scenes look and feel.

218
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.420
And I kept it pretty simple.

219
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.420
This can actually go for houses.

220
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.420
If you need a door open it over here.

221
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.420
But they're all the same type of copy of each other.

222
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.420
And all you're doing is changing them quickly on the fly.

223
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.420
Either as a whole or individually.

224
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.420
And keeping them kind of like in a group setting with the other ones.

225
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.420
And you can also do that with the other ones.

226
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.420
And I can also do that with the other ones.

227
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.420
And I can also do that with the other ones.

228
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.520
And keeping them kind of like in a group setting with these blueprints.

229
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.520
It's really great.

230
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520
And it allows you to add some more functionality.

231
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520
So if I wanted to make this more random.

232
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.520
Which is some of our other classes.

233
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.520
Which talks about the introduction to blueprints for virtual production.

234
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.520
You can actually go in there and make it more random.

235
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.520
So it rotates randomly as you move things around.

236
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.520
And shovel things around.
