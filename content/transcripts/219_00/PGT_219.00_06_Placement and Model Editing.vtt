00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
In this video, we'll talk about placement and model editing using some of the newer

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900
tools for Unreal.

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.760
So let's get started.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.360
The topics we'll look at first is placement and adjusting pivots, and model editing will

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.040
come next when we look at some of the sculpting tools that Unreal has to offer.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.420
The first thing we'll need to do is turn on these new tools in our plugins in Unreal.

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.760
So let's go and do that real quick.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.440
So in Unreal, we're going to go to our settings, plugins, and you can also go there through

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
edit plugins.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.320
And as we call this up, we're going to go and type in model.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200
You can type in mesh too if you want to.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.480
Oh, kind of make sure I type it correctly.

13
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.440
You can also type in mesh and turn on anything that you need with mesh editing.

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.000
But in this case, we just need the modeling tools for editor mode.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.800
This will give us our ability to be able to edit interactively and make our models and

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.960
shapes the way that we need on the fly.

17
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.120
And that's pretty convenient to be able to do so.

18
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.880
But there are some aspects of this tool that are still evolving and getting better and

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
stronger.

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.240
We'll go ahead and close that out.

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.820
Now when you do turn it on, Unreal will ask you to reboot.

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.520
So just keep that in mind.

23
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.360
So as it reboots, you're going to now have the option to have modeling.

24
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
Be able to activate that.

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.760
You want to hit Shift 6 if you want to use those hotkeys.

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.080
Now one of the first things I want to mention, which is super important to consider, is if

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
you are going to change maybe you want to change the pivot on an existing instanced

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.680
object, it's best to be able to make a copy of that first and then drag it in and work

29
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.680
with that instanced object.

30
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.400
So if you are changing any pivots or even sculpting, you want to be able to make sure

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.320
and understand that Unreal's instancing feature is going to change things all across the board.

32
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.840
So right now if I changed the pivot on this object here and I hit apply, it would affect

33
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.720
everything in there that's already been duplicated in the scene and related to it.

34
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.960
So what you want to do is go to your object's original area, original source, and I right

35
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.760
click and I can duplicate this object and then now I can bring this object in the scene.

36
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.400
And then now if I want to change its pivot, we know that it's only going to affect this

37
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
new duplicate and not everything else.

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.540
So just keep that in mind.

39
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.520
In older versions of Unreal with this tool, it may not have been as much of a problem,

40
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.320
but here you do want to keep in mind the instancing that occurs.

41
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.280
So if I did sculpt on this object and he was duplicated in the world, it would actually

42
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.760
show up on all the different assets.

43
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.520
So keeping a copy can be helpful specifically if you want things to be unique.

44
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.760
But I sculpted mine in such a way that even rotating these, they look like a brand new

45
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760
spike.

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.200
So you can also do that too.

47
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
It's kind of tricky.

48
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.760
It's kind of like doing things like with a tree, you rotate it, it looks like a brand

49
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.760
new tree.

50
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760
It's just the way you made it.

51
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.040
You made it asymmetrical.

52
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.860
So those are things to consider.

53
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.380
So now we have this object here and say we want to change its pivot.

54
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.500
Now there is the old way to change pivots where you would simply just go in here and

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.580
there's multiple ways to get this done.

56
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.180
But what I normally do is go to pivot and I'll say, hey man, I'm going to reset my pivot

57
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.100
offset and then I would change my pivot to what I want.

58
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.860
And then I would say, set my pivot offset.

59
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.100
Those were the two steps that I would do.

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.300
But you can also just say, hey, move if you need it to temporarily be at a particular

61
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.300
spot.

62
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.620
So I can say, set my pivot offset here temporarily, move your piece of geometry or rotate it for

63
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.940
that particular aspect of whatever you're doing.

64
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.100
And then you can just click away and go back and it will go back to its default.

65
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640
So that could be helpful in some instances.

66
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.980
But our new tool works pretty well.

67
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.480
In the fact that you can go in here and you can go to our transform, I can edit the pivot,

68
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.700
move the pivot physically as you would in a regular designated 3D application.

69
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.860
I can move this here or I can choose center, bottom, top, left, right, back and front.

70
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.820
All of these things can be quickly, can quickly give you access to those position aids.

71
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.660
And then you would hit apply, which is super helpful.

72
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.500
But remember, if he's duplicated in the world and maybe there's another copy of him that's

73
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.020
truncated and is rotated that is tweaked in some way and you change that pivot, it will

74
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.160
affect that duplicate in this current version of Unreal.

75
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.620
So let's keep those things in mind.

76
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.380
Another tool that we have to is if we want to sculpt this item.

77
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.740
Now we can cut into it, we can offset it, we can even displace it and we can even warp

78
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.740
it.

79
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.660
So if I wanted to go in here and do some warping, that's available too.

80
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.140
So you got to be careful though.

81
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.040
Anything if you go beyond a particular amount, you can stretch your UVs beyond their limit.

82
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.540
So let's keep that in mind.

83
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.660
But we're going to mainly focus on the two sculpting tools here.

84
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.180
So I'm going to go to the generic sculpt initially and I'm going to click on this one and I'm

85
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.920
going to zoom in on my scene.

86
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.960
Let me hit the control button so you can see exactly where my mouse is at.

87
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.780
So I can start sculpting on this object in such a way and it does it pretty cleanly using

88
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780
the default sculpt.

89
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.900
Now again, everything has its limit.

90
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.100
So if you go beyond the UV space or the shape, you may get some push and pull on your texture

91
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.860
and you may at times even get holes in the geometry.

92
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.980
So you might want to smooth these out and hitting the shift key allows you to do a little

93
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.980
bit more of the smoothing.

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.020
You can see there are a few options here and the ones we'll mainly focus on is in the sculpting

95
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.840
area and also brush size and fall off.

96
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.460
And our fall off is at one, which actually works pretty well.

97
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.040
But you can also adjust that according to what you need.

98
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.420
There's even a freeze a target area if you need and we're not going to get into that

99
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.420
just here.

100
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.900
But you can also control how this smoothing is going to occur with your fall off.

101
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.140
And in our sculpt, you can see we have definitely a lot of different choices to choose from.

102
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.740
Now again, we're using the default normal sculpt and it works pretty well with the UVs.

103
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.220
But where you can really run into some problems and you got to be careful is when you decide

104
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.380
to do, let me hit accept on this, when you decide to do a Dinosculpt.

105
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.860
Now the Dinosculpt is awesome.

106
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.700
The fact that it's really tries to imitate what you get from like 3D code and ZBrush

107
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.740
where you get a little bit more dynamic, a little bit more organic with your sculpting.

108
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.860
But in that case, it also can be at the cost of your UVs where you can get some stretching

109
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.860
in your texture.

110
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.860
So when you do play with this, just keep that in mind that you may have to go back in there

111
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.220
tweak your UVs.

112
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.820
Now we do have some UV tools and they're great, but they are also coming in a little hot.

113
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.820
They're evolving.

114
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.780
So when you experiment with these and work with them, just make sure you save as you

115
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.380
go as well as make sure that you understand the concepts of working with it.

116
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.700
Now we're not going to get into in this particular case, we're mainly going to be working at

117
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.500
looking at shape and positioning for this particular course.

118
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.500
All right.

119
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.260
So as I go in here and I edit these, you'll see the Dinosculpt come into play.

120
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:16.220
You can see here, this is was a normal sculpt, but over here I can do Dinosculpting.

121
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.460
We can kind of push things a little bit.

122
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.380
I'll do a little bit of smoothing again, hitting the shift key, do some smoothing and that

123
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.900
can help any weirdness with your UVs, your textures being hit.

124
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.400
And then we can hit accept.

125
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.100
And we can see it did a pretty good job.

126
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.100
There's a little bit of weirdness right here where we're pushing the shapes beyond the

127
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.780
polygon limit.

128
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.980
And in that case, we can go in here and maybe do a little bit more of a shift and smoothing

129
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.500
aspects and fix some of those issues that may occur.

130
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.060
It still gets a little bit of the stretching there.

131
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.500
And that's something you do need to be aware of because we really sculpted it pretty hard

132
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.500
on that one.

133
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.820
The generic sculpt versus the Dinosculpt is where you're going to see a lot of that type

134
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.500
of effect happening, where you're going to get some really weird, obscure effects in

135
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.340
here when it comes to warping and distorting things.

136
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:24.700
Escape for a second, we'll go back to Dinosculpt and we'll then again, you can do some smoothing.

137
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.460
We can go up a little bit here in this case, pushing things back a little bit more to normal.

138
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.060
And you may still see a bit of warping because this shape isn't the regular shape of this

139
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.620
object.

140
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.180
And I used a bit of moving in some cases.

141
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.180
Some of the stuff had already been there.

142
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:54.620
So we can use the move tool, move some of this back in based on the range of my brush.

143
00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.940
And hit accept.

144
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.260
So it's a little bit less, but they're still getting a little bit of warping here because

145
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.980
we created space that didn't exist before.

146
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.060
So just keep those things in mind when you're doing that.
