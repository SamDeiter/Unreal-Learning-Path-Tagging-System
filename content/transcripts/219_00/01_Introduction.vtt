00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.000
My name is Sean Spitzer, instructor for Epic Games

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.320
and master mentor for virtual production.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.560
What we're going to go through here

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.120
is talk about how virtual production and the pipeline

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.760
can be used to your advantage using some of our tools,

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.040
such as Quixel Mixer and Quixel Bridge,

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.600
and some of the tools within Unreal

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.520
to be able to make world building for virtual production.

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960
So let's get started.

11
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840
The first thing we'll look at is the scope and initial setup.

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.400
For this is very important to look at your scene

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.480
and how to actually efficiently build it.

14
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.360
Some of the topics we're going to cover is examining workflow,

15
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.800
determining shots and assets, and then also using mega scans.

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.040
So first up, we're going to examine our workflow scope.

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
It's obvious when starting and constructing a virtual set,

18
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.200
the scope needs to be examined and the overall amount

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.720
of work needed.

20
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.120
When it comes to Unreal, it comes into play,

21
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.760
it actually will work as a new type of tool.

22
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.800
And the fact that it can fill the gap of what you would normally

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.760
use from a designated 3D package that we could use in Unreal

24
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.320
to be able to create our sets and in real time

25
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.360
have an update of our scene and to be able to use

26
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.120
that for our virtual production.

27
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.920
It fills that gap that you would normally

28
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.240
see from a standard workflow, as you can see here in our chart.

29
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.000
It bridges the gap and makes it so

30
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.960
that our final output is in real time

31
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.240
and our visuals will update on the fly.

32
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.920
This is ideal in this workflow and allows

33
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.760
us to have virtual sets in the current climate.

34
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.320
So we have to determine our shots in the very beginning.

35
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.480
It determines what's going to be or going

36
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360
to have the highest priority.

37
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.120
Our hero shots versus our shots and items

38
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.200
in that camera shot, which are less important.

39
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400
How many polygons are we going to have?

40
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.120
What's our texture resolution?

41
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.320
So once we determine exactly what our items and assets are,

42
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.680
then we can push back and move things around exactly where

43
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.680
we need them and also take into account

44
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.320
what the textures are going to be and the poly counts.

45
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.400
So your scene layout is going to be

46
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.640
huge in determining exactly how your assets will be evolving.

47
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.280
So using Megascans, let's go and take a look at Megascans

48
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.600
and what we can do to get things going in the right direction.

49
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.200
So let me pull up Bridge here.

50
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.160
And you can see in Bridge, it actually

51
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.480
allows us to have a quick access of all the things

52
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.360
that we need and want.

53
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.800
Now again, Quixel Bridge is free if you have an Unreal account.

54
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.960
It allows you to be able to access all these

55
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.360
and have unlimited downloads for these assets.

56
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.040
And at your fingertips, you can easily go to the Home button

57
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.280
here and see what's new on what is the new collections that

58
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.120
popped up within Quixel Bridge.

59
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.360
These are fantastic.

60
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480
They allow you to get them quickly, download them,

61
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.800
and once they are downloaded, it will go to my Purchased area.

62
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400
You can see that the colors of the icons

63
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.280
will change in the fact that now I can export it.

64
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200
There's the export for it.

65
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.160
And these, and you can also favorite them too.

66
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520
So you can say, hey, I want to remember this asset.

67
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.160
You have an icon to click on.

68
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.600
And you'll see in your favorites,

69
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.000
you'll see that now I have one, which

70
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.480
is this rock set, which is fantastic as you work

71
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.640
and edit and collect these.

72
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.600
So you can see also what they look like.

73
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.640
You can see that the size is large.

74
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.440
You can see that it has some openings.

75
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.800
And you can see that you can also

76
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.360
use it as an assembly piece.

77
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.280
You can actually put them in groups.

78
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.000
And you can also see down here that there

79
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.680
is a collection that is all connected.

80
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.520
These assets are all connected within this collection here.

81
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.080
And that's actually pretty great to be

82
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.760
able to work in this particular type of tool

83
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.120
and to be able to get this done quickly and fast.

84
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.480
You'll see down below, we also have our settings

85
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.000
we can control, such as our download settings.

86
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.800
We can choose what kind of texture output we want.

87
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.080
We can look at the models that we want too.

88
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.800
And you can choose your LODs.

89
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.560
Now this is really important to consider when

90
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560
it comes to virtual production.

91
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.040
You want to be able to choose your LODs wisely.

92
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.600
If you have a larger scene and the camera's floating over

93
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.640
and maybe you're rendering to final pixels,

94
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.840
you may want a lot of these LODs.

95
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.520
But if you have a set that's up close

96
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320
and the camera doesn't move as much

97
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.080
and it's really static and your actors are in front of that,

98
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.600
in front of that scene, you might want to limit it

99
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.000
to more of the zero and one polygon counts for LODs

100
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.800
and not have to load all of these.

101
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.640
Because these can start to add up after a while

102
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.640
if you're not careful.

103
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.320
So let's go back.

104
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.120
And in here, you can also see,

105
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.280
you can choose your resolution, 4K, 8K,

106
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.800
and keep those things in mind based on

107
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.840
what hero objects you need.

108
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.120
We also have the export settings.

109
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.360
So we saw the download settings here,

110
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.600
but there's also the export settings

111
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.440
and we can click on those.

112
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.840
And in here, we can choose if we're going to go for Unreal

113
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.200
or any other Disney 3D package,

114
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.760
we can choose the engine version that we want.

115
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.280
And you also want to make sure you have your plugin

116
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.640
going to the right directory for the version of Unreal

117
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.760
that you have and you make sure it goes

118
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400
into the plugins directory.

119
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.560
The default project you want to keep that blank.

120
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.640
You can, you have the option to change that if you want to,

121
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.320
but I will easily forget as I'm in the pipe

122
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.640
and I'm really trying to get stuff done.

123
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.680
So I would leave this blank so that whatever Unreal

124
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.640
I have open, it will automatically export my stuff

125
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.840
into my scene.

126
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.200
You also want to make sure when you do install the plugins

127
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.960
for Quixel Bridge, that your Unreal is closed

128
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.240
at that moment.

129
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.560
And only open up Unreal once that plugin's all set in

130
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.880
and then whenever you export, we'll go into that open Unreal.

131
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.720
So make note of that.

132
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.800
We have textures here.

133
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.240
You can choose different surfaces that you want.

134
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.840
What will your 3D asset textures be

135
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.320
and your decals and so forth.

136
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.160
And they also have models here.

137
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.240
So what you will bring by default in your LODs.

138
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.840
And then finally, we have file names.

139
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.520
So here you can choose what your names are going to be.

140
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.120
So try to keep that as organized as possible.

141
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.920
And you can also edit that later on

142
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.360
if things change within your pipeline.

143
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.840
You'll see I'm saying the same thing here.

144
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.240
So I personally, again, do not have a default project

145
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240
to set that in.

146
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.720
Keep that pretty blank.

147
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
And as I said before, you'll see check boxes

148
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.240
which are little check marks off of the corner

149
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.160
which will tell you whether you have an asset

150
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.920
or whether it can be downloaded and exported.

151
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.520
And you'll see the blue right here.

152
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.920
It is ready to be exported.

153
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.560
So choosing your LODs wisely, like I said before,

154
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.760
and I will re-emphasize this

155
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.120
because this is really important to understand

156
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.480
with virtual production.

157
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.280
And Unreal is only going to do,

158
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.560
and Quixel is only going to do what you tell it to do.

159
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.200
So the LOD is very important.

160
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.240
You have to determine what and how much screen time

161
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000
that object's going to have.

162
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.040
And if that object, now LODs are level of detail

163
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.640
if you're unfamiliar with that.

164
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.000
And that level of detail is determined

165
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.120
how far the camera is from that object.

166
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.760
But if that camera never really zooms out or zooms in

167
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440
or doesn't do it very much,

168
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.320
you want to keep the highest level of detail

169
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.360
for your virtual production if you can.

170
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.400
And that's the wisest thing to do.

171
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.120
And you can always go back in Unreal

172
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120
if you need to generate these.

173
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.960
You can, maybe for another shot.

174
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.280
Maybe there's another shot you want to use Unreal for

175
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.160
and that one isn't virtual production based.

176
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.880
It's maybe a sweeping camera shot.

177
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.240
Then you can go in there and either export this out again

178
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.640
or simply go in here and in Unreal,

179
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.440
generate some more LODs to be used.

180
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.400
So here's a link that you'll see in our documentation

181
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.880
which gives you some further explanation for that.

182
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.960
I'm going to give shouts out here to Brendan Jones

183
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.320
for the donating the concept art

184
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.240
and King Chen for the concept art

185
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.520
that we'll be referencing in the next few slides.

186
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.440
So in the next video, we're going to be looking at editing assets

187
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.880
and how to work with them.

188
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.720
And I'll show you exactly what we need to do

189
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.800
to really get our stuff to come together.
