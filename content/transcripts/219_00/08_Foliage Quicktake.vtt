00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840
In this video, we're going to look at foliage, do a quick take of it, and see what the things

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.960
that we can do to build our worlds.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.140
So let's get started.

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.120
So foliage is a tool that can help populate our items in our world to get things in the

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.680
right spot relatively quickly.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.920
We can get it in there quickly and get the look and visual display that we need, but

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.120
is limited when using ray tracing due to photon counts.

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.480
Plants, assets with small details are a lot harder on your calculations and noise may

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.280
occur, which will force you to use CVARs in some cases.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.440
For the most part, when it comes to ray tracing and foliage, you kind of maybe want to stir

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.280
away from that, but if you do have foliage, keep it farther away from the camera.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.240
This will prevent anything in your virtual production from giving you some bad displays.

13
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.840
Now, if you're going for final pixels, you can run some CVARs to get you the best possible

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.840
results.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.600
And if your GPU is strong, you should be able to get some good results with it.

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.640
But just keep those things in mind.

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.720
It's very important to consider.

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.060
Ray tracing is evolving and is improving gradually.

19
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.600
And also eventually we'll absorb that, as you can see with our Unreal 5 release, that

20
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.380
Lumens is kind of taking over that particular area and getting stronger and stronger.

21
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.000
So you just need to optimize your scene accordingly if you're to introduce foliage and lots of

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.040
small assets if you're working with ray trace.

23
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.520
So if you are having trees move around, make sure you evaluate WPOs, works with your ray

24
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520
trace foliage.

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.900
It's more geared towards final pixels.

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.260
In a virtual production environment, ray trace is not really needed all the time, but it

27
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.260
may be.

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.860
It just depends on the art director.

29
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.200
They may want to see that bounce immediately.

30
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.280
And that also depends on your hardware and GPU and exactly what you're pushing to be

31
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.480
able to get these results.

32
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.380
And sometimes you could use screen space, global illumination, but you just keep those

33
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.700
things in mind too, because as the camera changes and moves, there may be some clipping

34
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
involved.

35
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
Hero Static Meshes is ideal to work up close.

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.040
So sometimes you may not even need foliage.

37
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.360
You just grab that tree, put it right next to the camera, and that can be a bit more

38
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.680
ideal in many cases.

39
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.780
But let's take a look at foliage up close.

40
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.360
So in my scene, you'll see, and let me get rid of this guy.

41
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360
He's pretty distracting.

42
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.000
And we'll change our material back to its regular state.

43
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's going to ask me to save, and I'm going to say no.

44
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
Oh, nope.

45
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
It decided to stick around.

46
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.760
I might have hit save, and that's fine.

47
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
In that case, we'll go in here and lower the strength of it.

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.440
A little more gray there.

49
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.640
Kind of closer to what we had before.

50
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.440
Maybe get a little bit wider.

51
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.240
So let's go ahead and take a look at that foliage up close.

52
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.240
Just a little small thing there.

53
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
All right.

54
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.160
So we have some plants in here, and I'm going to go ahead and activate my Foliage tool.

55
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.800
In my Foliage tool, Unreal and older versions wouldn't always populate here of what you

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.600
had before, but now it does remember what you had, which is fantastic.

57
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.760
And we're going to go ahead and turn all these on for a moment.

58
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.080
Now let's pick on one of them for a second and look at some of our settings.

59
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.100
You'll notice we have some settings here, but there's also some settings up top.

60
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.100
You can also control size, your density, and you can also have some...

61
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.380
You can place it in the current level if you want to, and there's also filter.

62
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.860
So what are you going to paint on?

63
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.580
You want to paint on other foliage on top of foliage, which is...

64
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.980
That's crazy talk.

65
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
Your BSPs, which is your generic volume structures.

66
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.100
They can be pieces of geometry for blocking, and Static Mesh and Landscape.

67
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.100
So right now we're going to...

68
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.220
Mainly Static Mesh would be our main point of contact here.

69
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.260
So see we have density.

70
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.580
You can see that my density have increased.

71
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.340
I've also messed with my scale size.

72
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.640
So when I paint, we have a range between a smaller and a bigger size there, and it's

73
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.060
free formed here.

74
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.740
You can keep it uniform if you want to, or lock it within an axis.

75
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.600
That actually can be pretty helpful.

76
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600
See my brush here?

77
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.140
I'm going to change the scale of that brush by hitting the bracket keys, because I don't

78
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.140
want to paint everywhere.

79
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.140
There we go.

80
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.460
Lower that down, just like with the modeling tool, and I can paint some foliage in place.

81
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460
Pretty nice.

82
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.780
And I have it so it's creating a really nice density in here.

83
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.680
And we can even edit some of that here as well, some generic sizes.

84
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.260
You can also do selecting of your individual assets by clicking on the Select tab.

85
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.300
It allows you to select these individually.

86
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300
So you see, oh, you know what?

87
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.300
I don't want this plant here.

88
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.620
You can select it and pick on it if you needed to.

89
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.260
That's up to you.

90
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.580
You can also lasso, which activates your brush tool.

91
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.660
You'll select a certain set that you want to do something with, or you want to change

92
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.500
them in some way.

93
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.140
Or you can even un, you can erase by hitting the Shift key.

94
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.780
It allows you to erase.

95
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.740
But there's also an Erase option up at the top, which is pretty great.

96
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.020
And I'll just erase some more, get rid of some of these.

97
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.740
We don't need all these plants everywhere.

98
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.180
It's crazy talk.

99
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.940
So you have some of these nice selection options and even Fill.

100
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.980
Now you've got to be careful with Fill.

101
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.220
You don't want to initially fill the whole world in the target area because that may

102
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.580
bog things down.

103
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.980
So there is a limit with this.

104
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.580
As amazing as this tool is, it can make your scene come to a crawl.

105
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.420
So you have to use it sparingly and you have to use it wisely.

106
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.500
And that means you know exactly where you're going to put it and how you're going to use it.

107
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.700
Now, if you come into issues in areas where you're like, you know, I think this is great.

108
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.100
But up close, I mean, I've edited some of the plants and I think they're okay.

109
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.720
But up close, I want to be able to have maybe the best, highest quality.

110
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.500
You don't always have to rely on foliage.

111
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.740
You can bring in actual pieces of geometry, just pull them in.

112
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.100
You can bring in the plant on its highest level of detail.

113
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.260
It's up to you how you work that.

114
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.580
But you can do that.

115
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.460
And that's fine too, especially for virtual production.

116
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.660
Because not everything has to be, when it comes to foliage, has to be an actual foliage

117
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.660
item.

118
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.620
If you're up close and looking at something, you may want that tree in its highest level

119
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.700
of detail without, because what happens, it'd be up close to the camera, because what happens

120
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
as you load things into foliage, it does become incidents.

121
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.540
There is a little bit of a hit with it, especially on how far you are from the camera.

122
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.500
But you can edit some of this too.

123
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.860
So if I go to this plant that we have active, scroll up, click on the magnifying glass,

124
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:17.220
I can go into this foliage actor and I can tell exactly how I want to, or how much detail

125
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.220
I want out of this group.

126
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.220
So I can say, hey man, I want high detail.

127
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.860
And when you, or even foliage.

128
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.620
I usually choose high detail when it comes to virtual production because I want to get

129
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.140
the best possible detail.

130
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.100
When you select that, it'll say it's going to change it for all of them.

131
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.100
Are you sure you want to do this?

132
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.100
I'm going to say no in this case.

133
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.060
And it will change it and make it so that you can have the highest amount of detail

134
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.060
for that foliage.

135
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.820
And it can't get expensive if you have a lot everywhere.

136
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.420
So keep in mind too with ray tracing, like I said before, it is expensive and not always

137
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.180
ideal because you want to avoid that noise.

138
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.860
And if you do use it for ray tracing, a lot of times it's better to do that with final

139
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.740
pixel, but you can have some plants and trees in the background.

140
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.500
And a lot of times you're doing a mix of that.

141
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.140
Here's my virtual tree and my virtual production.

142
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.660
Here's my physical tree next to the actor.

143
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.140
So you can actually do a trade off where you have stuff in the distance versus here's an

144
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.820
actual item, a physical prop and get it to match and look like it believes it's believable

145
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.820
for your environment.

146
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.540
So you can do a lot of cheating with that.

147
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.580
So the foliage shul is pretty great in the fact that if you needed stuff and it doesn't

148
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.060
have to be limited to just plants.

149
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.780
Now you can do rocks.

150
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.340
Say we turn all these plants off, even books in a library.

151
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.140
So if I go in here and select these two rocks, like, hey man, I need some rocks.

152
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.380
I can add some rocks in here.

153
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.380
It's really great.

154
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.300
And I can put them on static meshes if I want to.

155
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.860
I may have it deactivated in this particular case for this guy.

156
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.500
You can add it there.

157
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.500
So it's really cool.

158
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.500
It doesn't have to be plants.

159
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.820
It doesn't necessarily have to be trees all the time.

160
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.820
It can just be just some fodder, just some stuff that you have all over the place, stuff

161
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.980
that you just want to populate.

162
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.740
And again, you can control how it looks.

163
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.180
There's a calling distance control too.

164
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.660
Now this is a little bit more gamey and less virtual production.

165
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.060
Specifically for virtual production, a lot of times your camera is pretty fixed.

166
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.560
