00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400
In this lesson, we'll talk about editing assets using several of our tools that we have at

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.920
our disposal.

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.800
Some of the topics we'll be covering is Quixel Mixer, creating blueprints for quick edits,

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.560
and the Variant Manager.

5
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.120
When using Quixel Mixer, you want to make sure that your asset is in the center of your

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.080
world, and the pivot is in the right spot in the zero-zero point in the grid of your

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440
designated 3D application.

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.280
This is very important.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.240
You can do some edits when you bring it into Mixer and also Unreal, but it's better to

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.360
have this stuff done ahead of time.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.200
If we look at Mixer up close, you'll see right within our setup, we can choose what we're

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.640
going to bring into our scene.

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.400
I can have generic assets or have a custom model.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.000
You'll see we have Crunch in here, who is a custom model imported into our scene.

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.120
You can also bring in assets from our local library and online.

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.800
The hotkeys for that are L for the local library and O for online.

17
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
You can bring in those assets and immediately edit them as you work.

18
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640
This is very convenient and helpful, and allows you to have quick access.

19
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.000
Another thing is when you're adjusting your assets, if you need to, you can also adjust

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.720
the scale within our setup options.

21
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.440
You can see here that we can control exactly how our size is going to be.

22
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.560
This works in centimeters, so keep that in mind.

23
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.040
If you're working in centimeters in your designated 3D application, just make sure that is equivalent

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.560
to a 6 foot aspect ratio, which is about 183 centimeters in your designated 3D package.

25
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.840
If you're building in that 3D package, just create a cube or a block or some sort of rectangle

26
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.760
object that will represent that 183 centimeters for that 6 foot person, so that you keep everything

27
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.680
within context and then you can put things in place the way that you need.

28
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.440
We can bring in any material that we wish.

29
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.000
We're going to probably leave Crunch for a moment and go to a more simpler one and just

30
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.120
go back to Crunch.

31
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.240
Let's go in here and open our mixes.

32
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:42.080
We'll look at this alien stone to start out and we'll get back to Crunch in just a minute.

33
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.520
We'll see it load down here off in the very corner, so that it's loading the assets.

34
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.360
This is one complete asset all by itself, no extras, no extra parts, as Crunch does

35
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.720
have different pieces that come in.

36
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.060
In this asset, we have several different layers that we've created.

37
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.240
Up here at the top, you'll see that we have several layers that we can work from.

38
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.080
One of them here is we can add a surface layer if we wish.

39
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.880
This takes us directly into our local library and allows us to grab what we need, but we

40
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.920
can also go to the online library and find anything else that we need.

41
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.240
We see that we're working in all, but we probably more than likely want to work either

42
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.240
with different displacements or the overall just materials in general.

43
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.920
Whenever you're selecting an actual object, Unreal will want to know if you want to edit

44
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.520
that or excuse me, Mixer, and it will give you a prompt for that.

45
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.040
We're going to mainly focus with materials.

46
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040
Let's go back to the viewport.

47
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.520
You'll see that I have a few already in here.

48
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.520
You'll also see that I created a liquid layer, which you can do here.

49
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.440
You'll see the icon that looks like a drop of water.

50
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.200
I can turn this off and you'll see the liquid layer get removed.

51
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.480
It works similar to what you would see out of a smart material, where it tries to take

52
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.840
into account every aspect of our edges and our normals and changes in shape and tries

53
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.360
to apply the liquid accordingly.

54
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.160
It does a really cool job of doing it.

55
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.200
Again, we can change the color of that.

56
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.640
If I wanted this color to be, I don't know, more of a blue, I can add a blue to it.

57
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800
You'll see a blue tint.

58
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.840
And we can truly get like that alien landscape we've always dreamt and wanted.

59
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.280
It's really great to be able to edit that.

60
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.880
You'll see the threshold, the radius, and the detail.

61
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880
All these things can be edited.

62
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.360
And you'll also see if you wanted to add more of some custom masks and so forth, you can

63
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.200
do so.

64
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.480
You also see a thing called an add a layer set.

65
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.840
Now this is new to Unreal and this allows us to be able to paint within particular pieces

66
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.600
or different items that are separate within our model.

67
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.000
If we go back to Krunk, let me make sure I get him here.

68
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Always say his name wrong.

69
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Krunk or Krunk.

70
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It is Krunk.

71
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Krunk.

72
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Sorry, Krunk.

73
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Didn't need to get your name wrong.

74
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I'll say don't say it.

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.040
Load him.

76
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.840
You'll see that we have several of these layers already established and created here.

77
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.800
And in with each one, as soon as he pops up here, it's populating right now.

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.920
Within each one, we can paint in those pieces and those parts of that model, which makes

79
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.440
it really great to work from.

80
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.800
And you can see as I turn these off and on, you'll see that that ability is there.

81
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.420
And you also can isolate as you're painting.

82
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.120
So if you decide to make a new layer, you can say I don't want these particular target

83
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.700
texture sets to be included in this new layer set that I've made.

84
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.400
So I can turn these off and you can see these are isolated.

85
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.200
This is new to Mixer, which allows us to be able to have more finite control.

86
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.720
It's really great.

87
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.200
You can even create metal masks if you need to in particular areas.

88
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.880
And that's all available for you.

89
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.960
You can also see we can add decals.

90
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.040
So say we just wanted to do a hand smear in this case.

91
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.200
We haven't loaded anything else in our local library, but we can if we go online.

92
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.320
We can find some decals and in those decals, we can add some more things and items to our

93
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320
stuff.

94
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.960
We can add a lot of different decals that we can choose.

95
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.320
Maybe he has some graffiti that someone's put on his chest.

96
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.580
We can do that too.

97
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.020
So but we'll just say he's part of the Lord of the Rings hand clan.

98
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.360
So we can click on this one here.

99
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.840
And this hand smear is now in place within our scene.

100
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.900
And we can actually paint with it if we need to too.

101
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:38.820
So if we go to a new paint layer, we can also load different brushes, save different

102
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.460
brushes, but also go and replace them if we have that isolated.

103
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.780
So we can also place that within here.

104
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.340
So there's a lot of control that you can do within these, which is really exceptional.

105
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.500
In this paint layer, if we have another one we just made, we can go in here and paint

106
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.300
the details that we need.

107
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.180
You can increase or decrease using a displacement effect.

108
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.540
You can push up or push down.

109
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.900
This will give you that raised displacement or just set displacement in general so that

110
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:17.180
when you paint, you can accordingly change that based on our brush shape and jitter size,

111
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.680
all these different things such as angle.

112
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.140
You can control some of these effects as you go through in here.

113
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.700
And if you don't want displacement, simply turn it off.

114
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.500
So now when we paint, it's just raw paint.

115
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.540
We'll undo those because we don't want to affect crunch too much.

116
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.900
We don't want to upset him.

117
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.220
So using Mixer, again, we can turn our eyeball on and off to turn them on, but we can also

118
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.020
choose which type of things we want to paint.

119
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.100
I did mention and show you that you can also load brushes, whether in Photoshop or an existing

120
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.100
brush.

121
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.660
You can turn those decals into painting because right now what we did before, we just loaded

122
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.940
the decal.

123
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.780
But if you wanted to be able to paint the decal, that is available.

124
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.660
And you can also do a masking effect.

125
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.460
You can also control how textures are projected and how they are controlled on an object.

126
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.940
If we go back into Mixer, you'll see that we can actually go to, let's go to one of

127
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.820
these sets that are in here.

128
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.460
And you'll see, we'll open up placement here.

129
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.420
So this is the hand paint that's been done.

130
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.260
And I can control how the placement is on here.

131
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:42.940
Right now it's just box projection, but I can choose tiling if I wanted to.

132
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.980
And let's actually tweak this out a little bit here.

133
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.260
I didn't undo all the way.

134
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.100
Let's actually undo from our last stuff.

135
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.580
And let's pick, let's mess with scratches.

136
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.260
It'll be a little bit more distinct and we can see that a bit better.

137
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.720
We see some scratches that we see on his knees.

138
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.700
So let's go ahead and rotate and move those scratches, or actually on his arm.

139
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.340
We'll see that move and rotate.

140
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.300
We can choose how that projection is going to be.

141
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.340
We can control tiling.

142
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.820
We can go to free form.

143
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:18.100
Adds a little bit more edge detail, but you can control again the tiling and the scale.

144
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.260
And we can go back to box projection.

145
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.100
All in here is underneath placement.

146
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.540
You'll see many of these, which are active, we'll be able to have that.

147
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.020
You'll also see that you can add a material ID if you need to.

148
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.500
So you can separate your materials and paint with that particular material on a particular

149
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.860
area if you need that.

150
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.540
You can also add a group if you need to.

151
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.060
So you can make grouping folders.

152
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.400
You'll see right here is a metal mask.

153
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.940
As we click on this, you'll see it's isolated to what is associated with that object.

154
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.340
We can control its opacity if we need to.

155
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.860
That's on the hands distinctly.

156
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.420
And you can add some more details in here if you need to.

157
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.820
So we're not going to add a channel here.

158
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.380
We're not going to get that deep with this, but I want to show you the power of this particular

159
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.980
tool and what you can do.

160
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.540
You'll see the demonstration here within the GIFs within the lecture documentation provided

161
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540
for you.

162
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.500
I'm showing how you can paint and you can also isolate.

163
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.020
You can say, hey, I want to work with the arms.

164
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.580
I can work with a textured set editor here.

165
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.700
And that actually makes it a lot more easy for you.

166
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.980
So if we go into your layers, you can see the isolation that I talked about.

167
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.960
You can say, hey, I just want to paint on these items in this particular layer set.

168
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.420
And your layer sets up in that corner.

169
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.640
That makes it so you can isolate things a lot better and will help you with your workflow.

170
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.400
If you go into your actual layer sets that you have established, and I'm glad we have

171
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:56.040
Krunk here with us today, you can actually double click on it and you'll see, or actually

172
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.360
just simply click on it, you'll see what is being isolated for that object.

173
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360
And that's really helpful.

174
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.880
And again, having that is going to be a very strong benefit to be able to paint on your

175
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880
objects.

176
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.660
We can now, once we are finished, go ahead and export this out to Bridge.

177
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.540
This is a new feature and extremely helpful.

178
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:23.500
So if I go back into Mixer, you'll see that options in here so that we can control exactly

179
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500
what it's going to be.

180
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.680
And we can also customize what we want it to be.

181
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.900
So we can select a category and we can make a brand new category.

182
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:44.640
And in that Bridge, if we go to our local library and let's go to online and we can

183
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.060
see all the ones that we have.

184
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.220
So once I've exported it, let's go back to the very top.

185
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.580
Let's go to all our categories here.

186
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.000
And let me open up the Bridge real quick.

187
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.560
So in Bridge, we're going to be able to see exactly what we've made custom for our own.

188
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.740
Again, this is all going to be super helpful with your workflows.

189
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:16.620
So if I bring Bridge over here, we'll see any favorites that we've made.

190
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.520
We have local showing everything that we've downloaded.

191
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.100
We can say purchased collections.

192
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.060
I can also make a new one for myself.

193
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:38.120
So if I go in here and make a new one, brand new category, do a new category, new robots,

194
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.620
or just call it robots in general, and hit OK.

195
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.800
I can now export this one if I need to.

196
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.340
Export to library.

197
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.260
And it's now going to export this object.

198
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.460
And you'll see the exporting happening here.

199
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.700
It's going to be looking at all the maps, all the accessories, and everything that's

200
00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700
been painted.

201
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.900
And it's going to crunch that down a bit so that we can have this quick and easily brought

202
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:12.080
out of Bridge into any Unreal scene.

203
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.940
So this is a brand new feature, which allows us to really be able to maintain and control

204
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.540
exactly what we want.

205
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.780
And again, we can categorize new things that we've created, and then we'll take it into

206
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.780
Bridge.

207
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.380
Now, this just takes a little bit of time.

208
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.340
So I'll pause the video for a bit and let that run through because it's kind of squishing

209
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.340
things down.

210
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.980
You'll notice our texture is at 2048.

211
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.220
But when we initially set this guy up, it is set to a 4096 in some cases.

212
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.220
Looks like he might be done.

213
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.020
He may not even have to pause.

214
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.700
So let's go ahead and take a look at that in our library.

215
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.380
So in Bridge, we're going to click on our local library, and we're going to click on

216
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.380
Mixer.

217
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.900
And there he is.

218
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.180
There's Crutch, our robot, with our materials.

219
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.660
And there's a rock that you saw me messing with earlier.

220
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.900
There's that rock right there.

221
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.500
So both of these we've exported.

222
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.940
And now that we've exported them to Bridge, we can send them to Unreal.

223
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.420
It's really that easy.
