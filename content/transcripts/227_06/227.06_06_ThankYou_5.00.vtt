00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
So thank you for checking out today's tutorial.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.520
We've learned a lot about communicating between blueprints and UMG, talking about materials

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.860
and material instances, talking about how to change parameters and variables based on

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.320
certain inputs via blueprint, and then we've learned how to communicate between the both

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
of those.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.820
So hopefully it's given you some good directions of working, learn how to create customization

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.140
for your own projects.

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.820
So thanks again for watching and we'll see you in the next video.
