Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on the UNG fundamentals for HMI.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.720
So we'll be specifically talking about materials today.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.340
In the course outline, we'll be talking about how to create UI materials and adding some

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.680
border effects to the UIs.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.300
We'll talk about how you want to think about creating materials and then material instances

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.520
to edit certain variables based on a parent material.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.160
We'll talk about how to edit these parameters and then also the communication of data.

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160
So let's jump in.
