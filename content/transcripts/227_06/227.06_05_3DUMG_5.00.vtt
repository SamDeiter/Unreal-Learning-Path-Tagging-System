00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's just finish out this tutorial by creating a quite a quick 3D UMG widget which creates

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.400
some kind of stylized display in the world.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.600
So we'll create a new 3D widget which I'll jump into my editor here and show you and

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.880
essentially we can just render the speed of the UMG in the actual world so we can see

5
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.040
the speed changing to reflect the UI.

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.320
So in the editor here just right click, user interface and the widget blueprint selected.

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
I've called this 3D display menu.

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.720
So if I open this up you'll see that we have the canvas panel in place, we have just a

9
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.520
background color which you can see here width and height is 200 and then we've also got

10
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.080
some kind of bar here which I've bound to a progress bar which I will dig into in a

11
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.880
second here and we've also got the speed text which is the vehicle display which again

12
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.120
will bound to a set text functionality which again we'll go over in a second here.

13
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.360
Now the actual styling doesn't matter so much something along the lines of some text

14
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.560
and a bar is good here, a progress bar and if we go into our vehicle blueprint now you

15
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.400
can see that we've got this 3D widget component.

16
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.160
So we can actually go to add and we can go to widget and you can actually add a widget

17
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.200
into your blueprint and the widget class is going to be that 3D display widget.

18
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.480
So you can see here if I just delete this empty one now you'll see that this 3D widget

19
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.400
just has a location and a rotation kind of moved it out.

20
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.320
We've got the widget class set here so now when you actually go into the map you can

21
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.520
see this widget displayed in real time which is really nice if you want some kind of visualization

22
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.600
that's actually presented in the scene rather than just 2D on the user interface.

23
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.880
So go ahead and compile and save and let's look at the blueprinting involved in this

24
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560
display menu.

25
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.720
So first of all we want to use pre-construct again so we've got our pre-construct if you

26
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.800
just right click enter pre-construct and then we want to right click get player controller,

27
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.680
drag off the blue player controller and display controller and then the display controller

28
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.400
we want to get the hood reference and then we want to get the input UMG promote that

29
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.200
to a variable set that as the input UMG reference so input UMG you just want to set that there.

30
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.500
And then on the actual function side so when we've added functions we've got the speed

31
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.640
bar which if we go back into the designer the speed bar we want to create a binding

32
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.800
called speed bar and if I go back into here let's see what's going on.

33
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.880
So we've got the input reference so we drag off here holding down control drag off we've

34
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.520
got the car speed UI which is what we've created previously and you can just return that node

35
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.160
there and then the set text in a similar way we can go to the set text we've got a bound

36
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.300
event here so set text is our binding and essentially what we're doing in this function

37
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.020
is we're getting the UMG again so drag out here we're getting our car speed UI we've got our map

38
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.380
range clamped at 0 to 1 and then 0 to 150 on the out range and then we want to floor that value

39
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.460
and in a similar way as we formatted the speed before if you drag out here type format text you

40
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:02.100
want to type in speed and then add value in this the swirly brackets and then that will give you

41
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.100
a value input which you can plug in that floor value there so that's essentially what we've got

42
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.460
going on quick overview of a little UMG widget but hopefully that gives you an idea about is a similar

43
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.500
functionality if we've done previously but instead of it being on the 2d interface we've now got this

44
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.420
3d widget which if we jump into the map now just check out what's going on if I just full screen

45
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.420
this and press Alt and P you'll see that we've got our value in here we've got the car speed

46
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.940
going up and down so you can see that that value changing and then the things that we've done

47
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.540
before you'll see the airspeed changing and then also the temperature change in there so we've got

48
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.620
some nice basic UMG functionality going on here again the styling could change but the main thing

49
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.780
is that we've learned how to communicate between UMG and blueprints so let's go ahead and close

50
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.620
out this tutorial in the next video
