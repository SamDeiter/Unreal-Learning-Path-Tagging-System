00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Now let's talk about the vehicle display blueprint and how to create a controllable scene.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.160
So first thing we want to do is assign the material to the car mesh.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.020
So open up the display vehicle blueprint by double clicking it in your content browser

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.360
and then just select the vehicle mesh on the top left and then plug in the material by

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.140
pressing that little arrow there.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.940
And that will essentially assign the material that you've just created to the blueprint.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.940
Next up we'll create a display vehicle blueprint in the construction script here.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.120
So whatever element we plugged our material into we can create a material instance based

9
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.660
on that index.

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.380
So if you ended up plugging in your material just into element 0 which was the same for

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.620
me on the previous slide so if I just go back to the previous slide I've got material element

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.340
0 on my car.

13
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.780
If you've got a different material element so say it's on number 1 or number 2 which

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.340
gives you the overall vehicle you need to just make sure this element is updated.

15
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.900
So I'll jump into my editor and show you how to do that.

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
So with my blueprint open I will go to construction script at the top here.

17
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.380
I will bring in my vehicle mesh so I'm just going to hold down left click and drag out

18
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.820
the vehicle mesh from the component list and then I'm going to create a dynamic material

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820
instance.

20
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.540
So create dynamic material instance.

21
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.380
Again element 0 is going to be my element so just make sure whatever element you've

22
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.420
plugged your material into so if I plugged my material into a different element say the

23
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.740
chassis or the tyre something like this you would update this number inside the blueprint.

24
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.480
So just make sure that you have in the construction script the correct element for your vehicle

25
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.680
selected and then what you can do is you can just drag off here and promote this to a variable.

26
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.500
So drag off the blueprint promote to a variable and call this let's call this I generally

27
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.980
go with the naming convention mi underscore car material but you can name this whatever

28
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.180
you would like.

29
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:31.700
So that's just created an instance here which we can use later in the tutorial but essentially

30
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.980
this is the main setup.

31
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.140
Now you can override the source material here if you would like because the vehicle has

32
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.620
got the material already assigned you don't necessarily need to plug it in but I mean

33
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.820
even as a backup if you browsed to the material and then plugged it in there that would also

34
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.860
work completely fine.

35
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.820
So you can plug in them just as a backup just to make sure the correct material is assigned

36
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.380
but because the vehicle mesh already has it assigned you should be okay without plugging

37
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.020
that in there.

38
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.500
Next up we're going to add a scalar parameter to the variable that we just created so we

39
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.620
want to create two new variables which are two float variables one called display airspeed

40
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.900
and again you'll see that we are capitalizing each letter and there's no space in the name

41
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.220
but you'll see Unreal Engine creates a space which is really nice and readable and it also

42
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.820
means that we have a nice condensed variable name.

43
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.340
So we've got display airspeed and airspeed total time with this kind of setup I'll jump

44
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.340
into my editor now and show you exactly how to do this but this is the overview if you

45
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.940
want to move forward into the next section.

46
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.780
So inside of Unreal here I'm just going to go to my variables tab I'm going to create

47
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:56.740
the plus here and we'll call the first one display airspeed and then what we'll do we'll

48
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.540
change the variable type on the top right to a float so we'll call that a float so

49
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.460
it needs to be that green icon there and then we'll press plus again and this one needs

50
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.060
to be called airspeed total time like that and again you'll see that I'm not putting

51
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.660
spaces in my variable names and because I just create a float it creates another float

52
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.500
again which is handy so I'm just going to compile and save just to make sure everything's

53
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.020
okay.

54
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.740
So when I'm dragging out variables I'm going to hold down control on my keyboard and left

55
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.020
mouse drag so it does that.

56
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.540
If I just left mouse drag this out without holding down control I get the option do I

57
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.020
want to get the variable which is what this is or do I want to set the variable which

58
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020
is what this is.

59
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.780
If I hold down alt and left mouse drag I get the set so it can be a few less button clicks

60
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.180
if you hold down control on your keyboard and drag to get if you hold down alt on your

61
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.100
keyboard to set alternative if I didn't hold down anything on my keyboard I would get the

62
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.980
option get and set so completely up to you what methods you use there but essentially

63
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.300
if I just delete these I want to get the display airspeed so I want that and so from the delta

64
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.420
seconds I just want to multiply this so I'm going to multiply this by pressing the star

65
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.140
key you can alternatively just type multiply and I need to add a additional pin here from

66
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.540
the previous slide the bottom value is going to be 0.1 and I'm going to plug the airspeed

67
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.100
into here so you should have something like this this is a multiply going into the display

68
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.500
airspeed and then what we'll do is we'll add so I'm just going to press plus or you can

69
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.940
type add onto here and we want to get the airspeed total time so I'm holding down control

70
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.820
on my keyboard left mouse dragging so we get this kind of setup here next we want to set

71
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.900
the total time so I'm going to hold alt on my keyboard left mouse drag and let's just

72
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.140
plug that into there so essentially now we've got the variable that we need and now we just

73
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.020
need to set the correct scale parameter on the material so you don't need to click here

74
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.020
but on the construction script we've got this material now where we can edit parameters based

75
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.100
on the material that we created so if I again you don't need to do this but I'm just going to go

76
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:36.020
and find this in my content browser if I pin this up here I'm going to open up the material and what

77
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.060
I'm looking for is I'm looking for airspeed so you'll see that I have this airspeed value here

78
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:49.300
and this is the parameter that I want to edit so you'll see airspeed there so I'm just going to

79
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.260
go back into my blueprint so you should be here by now if you didn't follow me down that little

80
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.100
rabbit hole I'm going to stay in my edit graph I'm going to get my material instance so I'm

81
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.180
going to ctrl drag out the material that I created again whatever you named this in your

82
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.260
construction script this is what you're dragging out from the left-hand side I'm going to drag

83
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.820
out the blue pin and say set scalar parameter value and then I'm just going to drag this out

84
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:27.700
into here and then the value is going to be from this airspeed total time so you can just drag it

85
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.220
into there sometimes I like to double click on the wire and add a little reroute node

86
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:41.060
alternatively you could just if you don't want wires there do this as well and that would keep

87
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:47.740
it equally as nice and clean and tidy so the parameter name here as I mentioned is airspeed

88
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.580
and again that airspeed value is just from what we put in our material so whatever you named that

89
00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.060
in your material just type in airspeed there and then compile and save and we can move on to the

90
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.420
next section lastly in this section we just want to create a new function which again I'll jump

91
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.780
into the editor and do and so you can follow it step by step but if you know how to create functions

92
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.740
we just want to create a set scalar parameter value and make sure the parameter whatever we

93
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.220
named it whether we named it temperature or temp or whatever you called that parameter in your

94
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:26.300
material that's essentially what we want to do so we'll send the value to the temp parameter in

95
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:33.700
the material so let's jump into unreal and break that down for the function so back in our editor

96
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.540
we can see that we've got a function section on the left on the side so I'm just going to click

97
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:46.620
plus function and I'm going to say set temp again using lower and upper case letters to

98
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.420
differentiate between sets and temp so there's no space here but because I capitalized a T that's

99
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:59.540
now got a space I'll compile and save just to make sure I always just get into the habit of compiling

100
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:06.380
and saving as you go so what we want to do here is we want to set a scalar parameter value based

101
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.900
on the material so let's drag out our material again holding down ctrl I'm going to set scalar

102
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:20.020
parameter by value and if we look at our material again you'll see that we've got this temp here so

103
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.980
whatever you called this a value whether you call it temperature or temp this is what we're looking

104
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:31.500
for here so I'm going to type in temp also a good practice is sometimes if you've got complex

105
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.540
material parameter names I just click and then click again so it highlights you're going into

106
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:43.740
the rename you can also hit f2 to rename but I'm going to copy that text paste it in there now it's

107
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.580
quite hard to get temp wrong but if you have complex parameter names sometimes it's good practice

108
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.060
to copy and paste the values in so you know that that's definitely working I'm gonna drag this

109
00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.980
variable in here now now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to do a bit of a shortcut

110
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:08.380
here so I'm going to get this value I'm going to drag it into here and it creates a new node so

111
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.860
if you drag it into there it creates a new value I'm actually going to call this value temperature

112
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:22.620
let's see if I can just disconnect this compile save let's try and call it temperature now

113
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.660
so maybe that's not a shortcut maybe this works in yours this has always historically worked for

114
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.900
me maybe doesn't work for some reason but I'm just gonna compile and save I've deleted the

115
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:42.020
input let's go back to do it the old-fashioned way so I'm gonna select set temperature I'm going

116
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:49.860
to go to input I'm going to press new input I'm going to type temperature wow it's not working

117
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:57.220
okay this is super interesting let's call it temp okay so temp seemed to work so maybe it just

118
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.740
doesn't like a certain variable I'm not sure why that is you should be able to type temperature

119
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.580
but if you can let's go with temp which is a good temp name for this let's drop down to make sure

120
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:18.020
it's a float and now we got our temperature input let's compile save and what I need to do now is I

121
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:24.980
need to divide this so let's go to the the forward slash key for divide or we can type in divide here

122
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:31.260
and we just want to divide this variable let's go like that and we just want to divide this by

123
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:38.780
100 so plug in divide by 100 and then compile and save and that is your function created
