  "text": " Next, let's talk about how to import animations into Unreal Engine with some best practice tips here. So we want to import FBX using the Content Browser in Unreal Engine. So we want to make sure that because UE5 triangulates the meshes, you have the correct settings assigned here. So whenever you're first importing an FBX, click Import on the Content Browser, select FBX, and the first time you import a whole new character, you'll need to import the mesh and skeleton together. So the skeletal mesh needs to be checked onto, which is this box here, and import mesh needs to be checked too. Every other animation as part of a skeleton that already exists is fine, you don't need to do that every time. But again, first time you import a whole new mesh, a whole new character mesh, you want to import the mesh and the skeleton together. On the animation options side, we've got animation length, so the exported time is just the whole thing. Animated time is just the animated parts, and set range manually selects the frames. So you can also set the sample rate and import bone tracks, and some helpful importing notes, you've got your transform, which can fix any incorrect rotations, you've got the scaling, you can prevent any scaling issues by changing the uniform scale as well. And then also if you want to force front x axis, because the DCC might be in a different orientation than Unreal Engine, you can do that. And then you can also convert the scene units. So just a few settings that you can look through and see what works best for your projects. And then finally, we've got some new animations for old skeletons. So you would import just like normal, you'd select the skeleton that you want, and then you also then choose the animation length. So if the skeleton is exactly the same, then it should be pretty straightforward. If not, you may have to retarget it with the new retargeting tool. So do some research on the retargeting tool if it isn't exactly the same, and you want to know how to retarget directly using Unreal Engine. And then also, if you've purchased any animations in the library tab, you can go to add to project directly, and then you can add them to the different projects and migrate just specific animations. So if you want to add everything directly to your project, you can just select add to project in your Epic Games launcher browser. Or if you don't want all of the content, what we'd suggest doing is opening a new project with those purchased animations and just right click on the asset and then go to asset actions and migrate just the specific animations. When you migrate an animation on its own into a new project, anything that's connected to that animation, it'll ask you, do you want to migrate that as well? So it will bring the skeleton, if there's any materials or anything connected to that asset, it will migrate over. So that's a cleaner way to do it. If you're only using a select number of animations from a piece of purchase content, it's probably better to open a blank project, put the animations into that blank project and just move over using the migrate tool, the specific animations that you need. And then they may need to be retargeted. So it likely comes with its own skeleton there. So just a few settings to help you start getting your animations into Unreal Engine.",
