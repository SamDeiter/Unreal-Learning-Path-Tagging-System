  "text": " So to adjust the intensity of our tint and its interaction with the albedo. In the past we've used a scalar parameter and we'll do that here. So hold down the S key and click on the grid to get a scalar parameter, which we will rename albedo tint intensity. And we'll tie these two together with alert, a linear interpret node. Hold down the L key, click on the grid. And we'll pipe the RGB values of the albedo into the A channel of the LERP. So it's getting that information directly. Take the blend overlay information, pipe it into the B and use the alpha channel as the filter for this network. Now, because we want to use as much of the control this offers in our instancing tool, we need to expose as many of the parameters here as we can. So our three constant vector of tint, we want to be able to change that. So if we right click on our three constant vector, our color chip, we can convert it to a parameter and we can call it albedo tint. This already has a name and we want to include these in the albedo group so that they will be together in our tool, so that they'll be grouped together in our tool. So by selecting one, we can go to the group name. We've already named our texture albedo and so that name is still resident there. We can simply apply it. We can do this for the intensity as well. Go to group and set the albedo, set it to the albedo group. And so now in the tool that we're building, we'll have access to the map. We'll be able to swap that out, change the tint color and adjust the intensity of it. We'll take the result of the nerp, lerp and pipe it into the base color. And now we have the beginnings of a material. The next thing to do is to put together a metallic series of nodes to go into the metallic channel. And for that we'll need texture sample parameter 2D. This behaves a little bit differently than just a straight texture sample. We can get a sense of what it does by holding down, by having our cursor over the node and holding down the control and alt key. It's identical to the texture sample, except that it's a parameter that can be modified in instances of the material through code, say through, if this were being fed through a blueprint, you could gain access to parts of this, aspects of this that you don't have available through just the texture sample. So with this, we'll change this texture to something that we can say is metal-like. Again, it doesn't really matter. It's a placeholder. So we'll try, let's look for a blank white, which is a color that can often be used for metal. For metallics. And we'll call this metalness. And we'll create a group for it called metal. And we'll add something to control its intensity, a scalar parameter. Hold down the S key, left click. We'll call this metal intensity. And we can tie these together with a multiply. Hold down the M key and left click. And pipe the RGB channel into the A of the multiply and the metal intensity into the B. The next thing I want to do is introduce another idea that we haven't seen before, which is a switch. A switch will allow you to choose what attribute you want to apply to the channel, in this case, the metallic channel. Do you want it to be a texture or do you want it to be a value? Metal goes from zero to one unless you're using a texture map, in which case it can be used to make certain parts of the map more mentally, other parts less mentally. And to do this, we'll need something called a switch parameter. So if we click on it, right click on the grid and search for switch. Parameter, static switch parameter, it's actually called. And we'll call this, it comes up asking for a name, we'll call this metal switch. And we can plug our texture map and its controller into the true of the metal switch. We'll use another scalar parameter as the controller for just adding a value by holding down the S key and right clicking and we'll call this base metallic. And we'll pipe this into the false. We can see by reading the node that the default is false. So by default, base metallic or a single value is what will be used to influence the metallic look of our material. But we'll be able to switch to this system of texture and intensity within our material instance. So we'll take the metal switch and pipe it into metallic. Okay. I think I want to set this, the default value of our metal intensity, let's set that to a default of one. So we can see it later when we turn it on. We'll see it sort of more quickly, instantly, essentially. And we want to, again, group these as much as possible to expose them in the tool that we're building. So we already have a metal group and we can choose each of these individually and set them to a group or control click. And we can set all of these together to the metal group and now they're all together. Next, actually next what I want to do is make sure that we have access to it later. Create a parameter for specular. And the easiest way to do that is simply to go to the pin on the result node and right click on that and promote to parameter. And it comes up as a scalar parameter. And we can change it to, we can change the name to, you can leave it as is, or you can set it to specular intensity. So that matches the naming convention we've used for others. You may recall that specular intensity is default. If we look at the end of this tool tip, at the very end it says the default is .5. When you create the parameter, the default is at zero. Let's set it to be the same as the default. We'll set the default parameter in the details. The default value will make it .5. And that's taken care of.",
