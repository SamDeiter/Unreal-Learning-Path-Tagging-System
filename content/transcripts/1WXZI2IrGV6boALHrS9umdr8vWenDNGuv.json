  "text": " Hello, everyone. My name is Martin Cousins. I'm going to be your instructor for this course, Introduction into Gameplay in Unreal Engine for Programmers for Unreal 5.5. This is a follow on from the first course that we did, which was Introduction to Unreal. Quite obviously from the title, we're going to focus more on the gameplay aspects of the engine right now. So just covering what we're actually going to go over in the duration of this course, we've got to do a quick recap of a little bit of what we covered towards the end of our first course, just talking a bit about how the fundamental types in the engine. Then we're going to go more on to the first entry point for key classes relating to the player and some of the gameplay framework, it would officially be called, that's involved there. Going to move on from that a little bit and broaden that out a little bit to talk about game world and the flow that goes on when you start a game. Then we're going to talk about animation and inputs, both obviously very relevant for gameplay code. And then we're going to finish off with a couple of sections about just general coding concepts that are important to be aware of. You'll probably have encountered things like this in other domains, but just how Unreal works with these things. So that's delegates and events, serialization, programming subsystems, which is a more Unreal specific thing to be aware of, and then just some of the libraries available to you that can just provide some out of the box functionality to make things a little bit quicker. So first off, a little bit of a recap of what we covered in our last session. So the kind of fundamental classes on the absolute most base level Unreal, we start with UObject. We'll get into each of these in a little bit, but we've got UObject. Inheriting from that, we have Actor and ActorComponent. And then inheriting from that, we have SceneComponent. We'll go into a little bit more detail. UObject is the kind of base class for all our other Unreal classes. It's the entry point for reflection. It's got no physical representation in world, so most objects that inherit directly from UObject are kind of intended to be data only. They have no inbuilt tick functionality, tick being the update. If your game is running 60 times a second, your tick would be called 60 times a second. And UObjects have no inbuilt tick functionality. When you're spawning UObject, you have to provide it with an outer, which is the thing that owns it. If you don't provide an outer, then we use the transient package, which is essentially things that are not saved. So it's a kind of temporary transient object that exists for probably the duration of a level. UObjects can support networking, but it's not. You need to do some kind of additional layers of functionality. So if you're intending on doing networking, UObjects might not always be your first protocol or shouldn't necessarily be always your first protocol. And what we gave an example of in our last session was just a data asset, which is quite a typical way to use a UObject, which is, say we're trying to define an explosion. We might have a UObject that has some data that groups that data together in a kind of editor-friendly way. So we might have a particle, an explosion, and a radius. And we use all of those to define an explosion. Then we use that later elsewhere. Actor inherits from UObject. And this is kind of another big branching point for the engine where a lot of things then extend from Actor. That covers a lot of the gameplay functionality we'll inherit from Actor. Unlike UObjects, Actors do provide kind of easy functionality for replication and connecting between client and server. So it's whereas you should be a little bit more considerate when you're trying to implement networked UObjects, once you're at the Actor level, yeah, it's a lot simpler. We talked a little bit about this in the last session. But when things inherit from the UObject, they start with this prefix U. When they inherit from Actor, and downwards from that, they start with the prefix A. And that is hard-coded into Unreal. You'll get compile complaints if you're not obeying that naming convention. The other thing about Actors, which you can kind of see from the display here, is that Actors are intended to utilize a kind of component architecture. So an Actor might inherit and implement a lot of functionality itself. But they are also intended to utilize this kind of modular framework of components so that it's easy to import kind of similar sets of functionality between multiple Actors. Again, referencing our last talk, we had the Explosive Barrel, which was our example Actor. And as you can see, that utilizes several components. We've got a Scene component, which is our Scene root. I'll talk a little bit more about that again in a second. Static Mesh Actor. Explosion component, which is our custom component that we made. And then just some variables. So Actors can implement their own functionality, but they're best used as kind of ways to combine sets of functionality through components. Components, again, we've already covered a little bit. But they are essentially our modular building block. So typical out-of-the-box examples would be a Collision component or a Mesh component. So if you want to be able to visualize something or provide collision, those are really, really obvious examples. Another one I can think of off the top of my head is something that provides just pure functionality, something like a Path Following component. Or I think there's a component just to make things spin on the spot. If you just need a display in a gallery that just spins, there's a component for that. It provides this functionality in a portable way that you can easily chop and change it and put it on different Actors. There is a relatively strict relationship between components and Actors in that components can't exist without Actors. Actors contain their components. And it's not a one-to-one relationship, because an Actor can have many components. But a component cannot exist without an Actor. Yeah, and essentially they provide that kind of back and forth communication between them. Components are aware of the Actor that owns them, and the Actor is aware of the components that it has, which hence what this blue arrow is there to communicate. And the step down from just a plain Actor component is the Scene component. This inherits, hence this line to indicate that. And a Scene component is essentially an Actor component, but it has physical presence in the level. Where an Actor component can just provide functionality, Scene components also provide functionality, but in the context of a position in world. So when I gave the example of a collision or a visual mesh, obviously both of those things would have positions in world. So both of those things would actually inherit from a Scene component. Actors also require, at least at the Blueprint level, require at least one Scene component, which is referred to as the Root component. And when you ask an Actor, what is your location or rotation in world, actually that Actor doesn't innately have a location and rotation. What you're actually asking is what is the location and rotation of that Actor's Root component. They can only have one Root component, and then their other components are attached to that component. And Scene components have this kind of hierarchical, unlike Actor components, which are just slotted in, Scene components have a hierarchy between them. So you can child them to each other. And all Scene components of an Actor are childed to the Root component. So that about covers our fundamentals. Again, if you want to go into any more detail on any of that, you can go into our previous talk. But now let's talk a little bit more about the key classes relating to the player. So once we get to this level, we've got quite a bit of a more complex web of relationships to be aware of, hence the slightly, possibly overwhelming graph. Again, just to highlight what all these visuals mean, we have these solid white lines. This is just to demonstrate inheritance. And the dotted white lines are just indicating, obviously, there are a lot more classes that inherit from Actor. There are a lot more classes that inherit from Porn, and so on and so forth. But this is the kind of things we're going to go into right now. These are the kind of relationships we need to be concerned about. We'll zoom into each of these as we go along and talk a little bit more about them. But this is just an overview of all the things we're going to be covering. So we already talked about Actor. But once we're at the player level, one of the first things to talk about is a Porn. A Porn is essentially a base class of any Actor that can be possessed. That is either be by a player or an AI. Possess is the term for this thing has something controlling it. A Porn is the physical representation of a player or an agent. So it exists in world. Typically, when you have a playable character, it would be a Porn. And it's kind of a very basic plain canvas. It doesn't innately have much in the way of movement capability. It doesn't have collision. It has no visuals. Basic Porn has very, very little in it. It's just this functionality to be controlled. Porns have a one-to-one relationship with a controller, hence this kind of blue arrow here. Porns are aware of the thing that controls them, which is a controller, which we'll touch on in a second. And controllers are aware of the Porn they're controlling. Porns aren't assumed to be humanoid. They could be anything. They could be abstract. They do have a location in world, but you could have a Porn that represents a mini-game. And it's kind of like the thing that's pulling all your input together. You could have a Porn that represents a flying drone or something like that. It's not inherently a character with two legs running around kind of thing. It's also worth touching on the fact that actors themselves can consume input and have their transform manipulated. So that is not unique to Porn, but it is facilitated more strongly within Porn. So if you are thinking about controlling something, Porn should be your starting point. It's actors you can listen for input, but it requires a bit more setup. And that should be for special cases, really. So coming down from the Porn level, we have two more classes. We have Default Porn and Spectator Porn. Default Porn is not inherited from in other classes from the game. It's only into Spectator Porn. So it should not be the base class for when you're intending to make your own. It's just the kind of Engine Default Porn. So if you're in a random level and you don't have anything playable and you just click Play, I'm currently playing as the Default Porn now. It essentially provides some basic movement functionality. It does have a collision. It's got no gravity. It's kind of a flying style movement, and it's bound to input. So by default, you can use WASD and jumping to kind of move up. And it just provides some really, really basic fundamental functionality. Spectator Porn inherits from Default Porn and therefore brings along a lot of the same functionality. Actually, what the Spectator Porn does is replace the movement component that it uses. The Spectator Porn's movement component is primarily there to add in some extra functionality for the ability to possibly ignore time dilation if you don't want slow-mo to affect it and also just to remove the concept of a mesh, because the spectators are meant to be abstract. A spectator obviously being for at the end of a match, if your character has died and you still want to move around the space, that's the kind of assumption for why the Spectator Porn exists. Obviously, if you want to implement your own, you can absolutely do that. So going back up that chain slightly, the other class that we have out of the box inheriting from Porn that we need to talk about is the Character. Character is essentially a shortcut class. You don't need to use it. But essentially, what Epic realized was the vast majority of the time when we are making games or if we've got a playable character, it is typically an upright, probably capsule-like shape. And we would need movement. We would need visual mesh. And we would need collision. So the Character essentially just provides all of that stuff out of the box. It comes with a collision component. It comes with a skeletal mesh component, because most of the time our characters are animated. And it also comes with movement functionality baked into it. It has this special relationship with a unique kind of movement component called a Character Movement component, which we'll get into in a moment. But typically, when you're making a human-like or humanoid character, a character might as well be your starting point, because it just provides a bunch of functionality for you. The Character Movement component is a specialized form of the Porn Movement component. And it's linked quite tightly with the character. So every time you pull in a character class, it's always going to pull in a Character Movement with it. And the Character Movement component depends on a character existing. It expects to be implementing movement for a character class. The Movement component provides a whole bunch of functionality. It's first and foremost, it's got networking already baked into it, meaning that if you just instantly create a networked multiplayer game and you're using characters, that will mean you've already got your positions and rotations being communicated between the server and client. And it means that you've got client-side prediction, meaning that you're going to get a less aggressive reconciliation between your server and your client. It accounts for several different modes of moving. So we have walking, running, falling, swimming, and flying. And each of these is handled distinctly within the code. So if you need to investigate or inject functionality into these classes, they're all broken up into separate sections. You can also add in additional movement modes. So if you want to add in your own custom new movement mode that doesn't fall under any of the preexisting categories, you can do that. That being said, the Character Movement component isn't marked as blueprintable. So you can't make blueprints that inherit from the Character Movement component by default, unless you're going to go and edit the engine code yourself. And what that means is that if you do want to kind of blueprint your own custom movement mode, the way that's actually best to do that is on the Character Blueprint itself. So because the Character and the Character Movement component are so tightly linked, quite a lot of the movement functionality can be accessed through the Character class. And so the update custom movement event on the Character Blueprint itself would be getting called. And that's the point where you can inject any kind of custom movement functionality that you need. The other thing to kind of bear in mind is that as Character is inherently got a capsule, an upright standing capsule, Character Movement component is expecting you to make an upright vertically aligned character. So if you're not doing something like that and you want something more like a maybe like, I don't know, something quadrupedal, like a dog or a cat, the Character and the Character Movement component might not be completely suitable for that. So stepping all the way back up the chain now, up to Actor and inheriting from that, we have controllers. We've touched on this a little bit already. But controllers are essentially where a pawn is the thing that gets controlled, a controller is the thing that does the controlling. So where a pawn represents the kind of physical object in world, a controller represents a little bit more like that object's mind. It has no physical actor. It does technically have a position in world. Like if you started play, if I played a level, and you could actually see that I do have a, there are controllers actually in my level and they do actually have a location. But for the most part, their transform is somewhat irrelevant. They don't have any kind of collision or visual representation. The main purpose for a controller is to possess a pawn. It has a one-to-one relationship with a pawn. So a pawn can only be controlled by one controller. Really, it's intended that controllers only control one pawn. Obviously, in certain situations, in certain game setups, that might not be completely suitable. But the standard intent is for a controller to control a single pawn and a pawn to be controlled by a single controller. Controllers also get informed about a lot of events and notifications about the pawns they're controlling, if they stop possessing it, and many other things. The other thing is that none of the transform functionalities are exposed in native in C++. So again, you're really not intended to manipulate the location and rotation of the controller. One thing to talk about very briefly, though, is that, as you could see when I was quickly demonstrating there, if at runtime you have your controller selected, you will be able to see that our rotation is changing as we move our viewer around. This is slightly more in-depth. But essentially, when you are controlling a pawn, you have a concept called the control rotation. And that is vaguely meant a default way of representing what is the intent direction of this pawn. And that might be the player's view rotation. It might be the direction that an AI is moving in. And that is, when you're talking about that control rotation, that is actually the rotation of the controller. So whilst, for the most part, you don't need to be editing these things, the rotation of the controller does actually have some meaning, which is why you see it updating in runtime. So inheriting from controllers themselves, we have two different classes. Unlike these other classes, pawn and actor, which might have a lot of things inheriting from them, controller is specifically only inherited by these two types. You could inherit from it yourself. But controller is an abstract class. And player controller and AI controller, where you actually get into things that you might actually see getting spawned in your game. So a player controller represents the human player's will. You would have a player controller exist for every human player in your game. So if you had a local co-op game and you had four players, you would expect to have four player controllers spawned in your level. They essentially act as a centralizing point for your player's camera and input. Both of these systems are actually handled by other systems under the hood. There's something called the player camera manager and the player input components, which they really handle each of those things directly. But the player controller gives you a way to interface with both of those things. Player controllers also persist throughout the duration of a world. That's true of controllers in general. But typically, when you start a level, your players would already exist. There is functionality to spawn new players in. But a player controller would exist for the duration of a world as long as that player exists. The other thing we'll get onto in a moment is the fact that the player controller exists on the server and on the controlling client's machine. So in a networked multiplayer scenario, the server would have a copy of each player controller. And each client would see their own player controller, but not others. We'll go into more detail about that later. But it's a thing that's worth highlighting. So separately from that, the other kind of branch that we can go down is AI controllers. Pretty self-explanatory. This is the will of an AI entity. So where a player controller represents a human player, an AI controller represents some kind of AI that would be controlling entities within the world. Just like a player controller, because they're a form of controller, they can possess pawns. And this means that you can have a pawn that can be controlled by a player. And the exact same pawn could be controlled by an AI. And the idea being that's intentionally abstracted into separate sections so that you might be able to reuse these things. Thinking about something like a game like Unreal Tournament or something like that, you really have the same characters running around picking up guns, driving cars, shooting things. And it's just it might be a human controlling that entity or it might be an AI. So this is kind of a helpful way to think about these things about why they might be structured the way they are. And the way an AI controller works is there's a set of components that really kind of drive that logic. We'll get into more detail in this in another session. But just briefly to touch on it, you have the Blackboard component, which is essentially that AI's kind of knowledge and memory. And then you have the Brain component, which kind of performs the logic. And that most typically exists in the form of the behavior tree. But there are other classes that implement that kind of Brain logic. The other thing to highlight is unlike player controllers, these only exist on the server. Because Unreal is server authoritative, it's only the server that really is managing the AIs. And then each client, what they really get is just a replicated form of what all the AIs are doing on the server. So it's only the server that needs those AI controllers to exist.",
