Hello everyone and welcome to this session on Datasmith Automation. My name is Amer Yassine and I will be your guide today.

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.500
Our agenda will review some general aspects of Datasmith Ingestion, and why it's important to clean up incoming data before ingesting it into the engine.

3
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.200
We will then explore ways to automate repetitive tasks using two different approaches, one through Python scripting examples,

4
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.900
and another by using a tool called Visual Data Prep, which will be the focus of this session.

5
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.100
To feel comfortable following this class, you should have some knowledge of Datasmith Ingestion techniques,

6
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.100
and a working knowledge of CAD or Digital Content Creation applications in order to build the data you wish to import into Unreal Engine.

7
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.700
And so, if you're ready, let's start.
