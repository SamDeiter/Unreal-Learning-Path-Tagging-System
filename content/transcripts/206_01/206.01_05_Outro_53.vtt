00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this class, we have reviewed some general aspects of Datasmith ingestion, and why it's important to clean up incoming data before ingesting it into the engine.

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.700
We also explored ways to automate repetitive tasks using two different approaches, one through Python scripting examples,

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.300
and another by using a tool called Visual Data Prep, which was the focus of this session.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.100
Both methods showed you ways to intuitively clean your incoming Datasmith files and cut down the time it takes to clean them up manually.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I hope you have found this class useful and that you will be able to apply what you have learned to your own projects.
