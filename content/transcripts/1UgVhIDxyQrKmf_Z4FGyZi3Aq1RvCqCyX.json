  "text": " Now, let's walk through the basic workflow of a project environment so that you can gain a better understanding of source control collaboration in action. First, let's meet our team. Developer A, an artist. Developer B, another artist. Their team lead, Developer C. And finally, the star of the show, the depo or server. Now, Developer A is super good at flowers, but not so much at Sims. So, it's time to team up with Developer B and get to work making the total flower package. First, Developer A creates a file locally. This is the flower asset that she's going to work on, but before she starts, she needs to add the file to the depo. This tells the depo to start tracking the flower and to include it on any submissions or updates. Developer A then works locally and when she's finished working on the flower, she uploads the finished file to the depo with a description, submitting it and creating a version. Now, Developer B gets updated and downloads the latest version from the depo locally to their machine. This gives Developer B an exact copy of the version that Developer A submitted. Developer B is now ready to do their thing and put that stem on the flower. So, they start by checking out the flower and that in turn locks the flower on the depo so that Developer B can start modifying the flower and add that stem. Now, checking out the file doesn't really prevent others from modifying the file, but it does prevent them from checking it out. This means that Developer B doesn't have to yell across the room to let Developer A know that they are working on the flower, so they really shouldn't try to change it. Developer B gets to work and in no time he has modified the flower and saved it locally. The stem is glorious and the revision is ready to be submitted. So, once again the file is submitted and versioned. This new version now becomes the head revision or the latest revision for the flower. Once the flower is updated, the other team members will see that the file they have is now out of date. So, if they try to modify it, they are going to be warned and they'll need to jump through some hoops in order to save that file. Instead, the team will just update the copies that they've got locally. So, Developer A will pull a new version and update her copy. Next, the team lead will pull the latest version for review and he's happy with the results. Now, the entire team is on the same page and ready to party. Okay, that's an ideal example, but let's say the team lead takes the flower to a director and they aren't happy. So, the team repeats the process and goes through several notes to make multiple changes on the flower, pushing four or five iterations to the depot, eventually creating a version that results in a happy director. Unfortunately, the director after seeing the results on camera changes their mind and decides that where we ended up was not great. In fact, the director asks the team to go back to a second version and it looks like that was the best version on screen. So, in Perforce, you can revert to that in multiple ways, but the end result of reverting to the second iteration will actually create a six iteration, since the update to that file will be non-destructive to the other versions. Just in case someone changes their mind one more time. That's it for the basic workflow and project environment. I hope this helps with your understanding of source control and in our next section, we will explore the server and client setup as we look at working with the Perforce client.",
