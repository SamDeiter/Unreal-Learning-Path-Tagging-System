  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at GPU light mass in detail for optimization. And it's going to be a bit of a review. So let's go ahead and tackle that. So GPU light mass, it basically improves on the current light baking system, or I should say the older light baking system. It uses a progressive light mapper with optional real time preview in the viewport. So offering multiple modes for building lighting. You can do a full bake or you can bake what you see, which will help speed things up. It significantly increases the speed of light bakes for complex scenes, producing a more physically accurate result than CPU based light mass, but it has more limitations. There's a few things we'll talk about on the back end of this on what those limitations might be. So in review, again, we were reviewing this. The other foundational courses talk about this. First up, you do need to turn it on. It's in your plugins. But from there, you also want to make sure your DirectX 12 should be on by default. But you do need to enable ray tracing that needs to be on virtual texturing and virtual texture light maps can show you your interactive preview as you're working. If you're working in ICV effects, you don't necessarily need these unless virtual texturing you're using them. But for the most part, that update, as you see the bar build things is not really necessary. GPU light mass window is now after you do all this X accessible to be able to look at your stuff and to do a quality control pass. So some of the settings here we're going to briefly talk about. We're not going to get too much into button ology. This is a review, but I'm going to start talking about some of the key features and things to look out for one. Again, you have the option to full bake or partially bake. Make sure you turn off your compressed light maps in your scene. Here, GI samples and stationary light shadow samples. You can control that as a sweeping control. I like to do those on an individual level because it's a case by case volumetric light map a simplified option version of the CPU volumetric light map control. So you have a little bit of quality control there and iridescence caching here. So helps with interior scenes. It may not be needed to be adjusted. The default works pretty well. So workflows here, you have a denoiser here. No denoising is applied to the lighting render. And this can be useful for to determine a number of GI samples. So it's up to you how you edit those. We can look at the settings in just a bit here on completion denoises the results of the light build. So it makes it a bit cleaner for you during the interactive preview. You can also have this here. It will denoise it on the fly. So you have those options, either none on completion or interactively, and you can see it do its job. Now, let's go back into Unreal and we'll get back to this slide and we're going to take a look at those settings up close. So in my scene here, you'll see that my build is active, ready to go. There's a viewport real time is on. If I wanted to, I could turn that off. I'm just leaving mine on for now. There's a full bake or you can just bake what you see. Again, that option is available for you. And the denoiser, I have mine, the default set on completion. And again, you can say no, or you can have it during the interactive. So you really do want to try to use that denoiser if you can. You'll see it says Intel open image denoiser, which works really well. We have GI samples. Most of these default work pretty great. And it is pretty darn fast and compared to the CPU build. So all of these are at your fingertips. Now, let's talk about a few things when it comes to some pro tips and some optimizing. So final pixel, it's helpful to speed up things and get them ready to go if you need it. But again, I would lean more towards Lumen or even a path tracer. If you're going for a better visual overall control, because there are limitations with reflections and reflective properties. They just won't quite look right, especially if they're clear. And you can see characters walking past them. It's a little bit of a stretch and you'll have to do some tweaking to try to get it. And there's still high levels of limitations there. And the fact that the reflections won't look realistic, they'll be screen spaced. So you might want to switch to path tracer or even ray tracing or Lumen in that case to be able to get the better visuals in that area. ICV effects, it can't be perfect for making quick lighting changes and can be combined with ray tracing. But you'll have to play with that workflow a bit. I'll mention it. But again, I do want to encourage everyone to try to lean towards Lumen if you can, because Lumen is going to give you the best results. But there may be a shot where you have lots of noise and you can't get past it. Then you can actually maybe use this light mass GPU on that case and to be able to tweak things accordingly. After you do a build, you want to make sure that you go to ray tracing and you turn off all those effects. Let's actually look at a build that I just made and run this CVAR. And you can see what I'm talking about. So once I have this build set up and you see that we've built this, ignore this up here. It's a little bit of an error. It's an older conversion from an older version of Unreal, which will continually tell me it needs to be rebuilt, but it's already done. So I'm going to go to my output here and I'm going to do a control V and I'm going to go ahead and get rid of all my ray tracing effects. And this is going to give me the true bake, because remember, GPU light mass is using some of that ray tracing to be able to speed up our process. Unfortunately, some of that can still be in the air and will give us kind of false results. So I'm going to hit enter. So when you do that, you now actually make it so that the ray tracing is gone. Now, I may have already run this command in the past, and that's fine. But for the most part, that removes any errors that may be occurring in here. And no ray tracing is going to be set in. So again, you want to run that CVAR when you can. Again, that makes it so that that is we're not using any kind of ray tracing. We're turning it off so that it doesn't interfere with our final results with our scene. Now, again, you can turn them on if you need to. And you can turn them off if you need to. You'll see it's turned them on and I will turn it off again. Just so that you know. We are in the mode we need to. You can see the shift there. So that's probably just because I ran that console in the past. Cool. Awesome. So when running GPU light mass, you may run into a TDR delay is situation happening. If you do, make sure you go into your windows and you want to go to your local machine here and then you want to set your TDR delay, you want to modify that and set it to like 60 if you need to. You can even go a bit higher if you need to. Never mind here where it says an old reference link. This is still valid. And it's basically just the TDR information that we're using. And, yep, here's some limitations and things you need to consider. So light mass portals are not supported. We talked about that before. Pixel depth depth offset is still not supported yet. Lighting channels not supported. Use light maps, excuse me, light mass importance volumes to help with the volumetric light maps. This is really important to consider because using a light mass importance volume is used in a regular CPU baking environment. And you can find that under volumes, but you really do need it for GPU light mass, especially for characters moving around, because it actually helps unreal digest that information for characters moving around for updated shadows. Now, typically in CPU, you want to use that because you have priority areas, especially for a larger scene, or maybe you're working with terrain. But it's really key when it comes to the GPU light mass. World position offset is not supported. Texture encoding and denoising are run on CPU and are not affected by multi GPU. So consider that if you are using the system. Stationary skylight currently not supported, but on the road map and custom settings and properties of lights. Some things such as indirect lighting, intensity, source texture, and a few other things are not fully supported and quite there yet. Now you see a list of limitations found here, which can also help you in the direction for five point three. Also, light channels are not supported, so make note of that also. That's it with this section. In the next section, we're going to go ahead and take a look at screen space, global illumination. Thanks again.",
