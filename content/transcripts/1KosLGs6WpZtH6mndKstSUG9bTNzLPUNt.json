  "text": " Now that we've customised some of our animation with the Simulate Physics options, maybe we want to capture and to save it and be able to play back the same animation every time. So the Tape Recorder is a great tool to use for something like this. You can capture something that's happening in real time and save it as a sequence that you can then edit further. As a quick overview of Tape Recorder, it's a plugin that you need to activate before you can use it. You'll find it in the Plugins window inside your editor and it should ask you to restart your engine once you activate it, so be sure to save things first. It now replaces the Sequence Recorder and is a great tool for use within virtual production environments, because it can record everything that happens to any actors that you specify. It also creates a sequence with tracks for each actor that you can review and edit instantly. Now we'll jump back into the engine and capture some of our physics animation and see how we can view it and edit it in Sequencer. We're back inside our project and we've got our physics set up on our character how we want it. So let's see how we go about recording that character using the Tape Recorder and we'll review the recording of the sequence and just see how we make any edits to that take. So the first thing we need to do is actually load the plugin for the Tape Recorder. So if you go to the top right to your Settings panel here, we have an option called Plugins. So here you can search for Tape Recorder and if yours is not enabled, you can enable it with a little checkbox here. And as soon as you enable it, it'll ask you to restart the engine so that it can load the plugin. I've already done that just so you don't have to sit around waiting for my engine to restart. But once you've done that, inside the Window drop down inside Cinematics, you'll see a new option as Tape Recorder just inside here. Now this is your Tape Recorder window and there's a fair amount going on in here and we're only going to go over the basics of how to load your source and capture a take and then how to review the take and make any edits you might want to in the Sequencer file. So the Tape Recorder is going to be able to capture everything that's going on in the scene for anything that you specify as a source. And you specify your source with the plus source button here. Now you can choose anything from your level using the From Actor option. This might be static meshes or skeletal meshes, player characters, anything you have in your level. You can also choose from Live Link. So this might be anything that you've got connected from your virtual production process. So it could be a MoCap actor that you're capturing or it could be an external camera tools that you want to capture data from. You've also got any chaos caches that you have in the level here that you could select as well as a handful of sources, sort of default sources down here. Now we want to capture the player character. So we're going to choose player down here as our source. Just to touch upon some of the settings for the Tape Recorder window that could be useful, you can access them via this cog in the top right. And this way you can change a bunch of different parameters for the recording that you're currently capturing. So you can decide where you want to save it and whether you're not using time code and any sort of working units you're using. And something quite useful that we're going to use here is the countdown. So this is a countdown until the recorder actually begins recording. So it allows you to get things set up in a few seconds or however long you think you need there and before the tape recorder starts recording. And it gives you a countdown on screen so you can see when it's about to begin. Now I'm going to leave everything as default for now, just because what we're doing is quite simple recording. So the first thing I'm going to do is hit play. And this is just getting the level ready because we're capturing the player. So we need to be simulating or playing in the level. Now I'm going to hit record and we'll get that countdown timer that we talked about. And now we're recording. So we can see it recording live in the sequence underneath. So if I hit number nine now, we'll see our character go into their simulate physics mode and we're capturing all that data as well. Now, as soon as I hit escape, we'll stop simulating or stop playing and the tape recorder will actually stop recording at the same time. Now to access this recording, we could, you know, take a look at where we'd saved it and take a look at this file path. But if it's the previous recording that you want to review, it's quite useful button at the top here that says review last recording. And as we click that, we'll see that the sequence opens, the master sequence opens with our camera track in it that has captured the recording of the player character camera. And there's a sub scenes track which adds the sub sequence which contains the information from the character that we added as the source of the player character. Now in here, we can edit all the animation that we have, edit any of the parameters or any of the tracks that we have for the transforms and for the character for the camera. But you see at the moment, we can't do anything with them. They're kind of grayed out. And that's because by default, the sub sequence comes locked. We just need to hit this little padlock to unlock it. So now we can kind of move these around if we want to. We can retime things. We can chop and edit animations. So if we just want to capture the bit where our character activated physics, we could just do that. So we could shrink that right down and see that we can just capture that section there. And what it might be worth doing as well is just shrinking the timeline of our sub sequence to match that there so we can just capture a small performance. Now what you can also do here is save this animation out as its own animation. So if we right click our character mesh, you can choose bake animation sequence. And then we can choose where we want to save that. I'll just put it inside the content folder for now and you can give it a name. So we could call that physics animation. Oh, of course, we can't be putting spaces in. So physics animation. And you can edit any export settings that you might want here. We'll just leave all those as default again. And now if we go and access that folder, oh, here we are already. You can see we can open this physics animation or this animation that we baked down. And we've just got that section that we cut up. We could then throw that into a new sequence. We could then blend between multiple animations if we wanted to. And anything else that you can do inside the sequence of file. But that's quite straightforward there how to capture a simple take. If you wanted to capture another take, you would just hit the return arrow here. And then set it up in the same way. So you just hit play to start your level, hit record, wait for the countdown to finish. And then you're off again. Thanks for watching.",
