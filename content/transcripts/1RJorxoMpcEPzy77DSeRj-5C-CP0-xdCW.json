  "text": " Hello and welcome to this next video. For this, we'll be going through another example. We're going to be having a quick look at the WorldRayHitQuery node. So for this example, we are on slide three, example three, projection. This is actually slightly different from the projection node itself, which is usually used to make things stick to the floor if you're working above that. However, what we are looking at here is the WorldRayHitQuery. And so this is a different method of getting our first starting points. Because when we, what we've been using up to this point is spines and landscape materials. In this example, we're doing it in a slightly different way. What we're doing is we're using the WorldRayHitQuery combined with a filter so that we can see that we're only looking for actors which are including the filter. Vines, it's going to ignore everything else. And if we have a look into the level of how this looks, you can see that we have a whole load of different vines that are hanging off of these different static meshes. It's a nice way of getting stuff on things because we're not always going to be working with landscapes. And you might want to put stuff on the bottom of meshes or on the top of meshes. And the WorldRay is a good method of doing that. In this case, it's a more perfect example, but it gives you sort of an idea of how you can do a powder. Just hanging a couple of, a bunch of vines in on the meshes as they are. So a quick look at it. What we have is our origins. And then we've got the world direction. And it's going to do a whole load of lines out from that point. A bit like how the direct light functions. It's like doing lots and lots of line traces, which is kind of the same thing that the projection node does as well. In this, I'm using the landscape as a cutout so that we can not create the vines too low down. OK. And that's it. A nice quick one.",
