  "text": " With all the under the hood stuff out of the way, let's take a look at what the actual DNA of an Unreal game looks like, and how we can best use it to build our games. As mentioned previously, UObject is the base class for all UE4 types, including all assets inside the Content Browser. They have no physical representation in the world, and they have no built-in tick functionality. As they've got no concept of the world, they have no ability to update per frame. They must be given an outer, this is the object that this object resides in. If one is not given an outer, it's put inside the transient package, which is the top most package used for storing temporary objects which should not be saved. Objects can support networking, but they do not come with it set about the box. If networking is required, perhaps reconsider whether or not UObject is the right solution for your current technical requirement. As an example of a UObject, we have the UExplosionData asset, which is used to define properties regarding an explosion. UExplosionData extends directly off a UObject, and is usually accompanied by a scene component as its root, giving it a physical representation in the scene. For example, consider an exploding barrel. This would be an actor, consisting of smaller, discrete pieces of functionality and a physical representation through some flavour of mesh. Actors do have networking support by default, giving us access to RPCs like we discussed earlier, as well as standard variable replication. They're exceptionally well suited to a component-based architecture as opposed to a giant monolithic class. So at this time consider the following. If my current technical design requires either networking or ticking, go with actors and components. If you don't require either, consider using the UObject. Actor components allow us to roll functionality into a single class. They require an actor to exist because they cannot simply exist in the world. They're designed to be part of an actor. And they're excellent when used in conjunction with Blueprint to expose their parameters to design with sensible UProperty use. So as an example, we can add an explosion component to our exploding barrel actor and keep the actor class completely unpolluted. If another actor in our game requires some kind of explosion functionality, we can simply add the component to that class as well without having to duplicate anything. We can also add UProperties to the explosion component to allow design to plug in an explosion data asset in as a field, letting them balance and tweak the functionality separately. Actor components are not particularly ideal for networked functionality as dormancy can only be set on an actor level as opposed to a component level. A dormant actor will send all of its components dormant as well, so we may end up with erroneous or unacceptable behavior as the project grows. A scene component extends off of actor component with the benefit of providing a physical representation in the scene. They can be attached to other scene components as well as bones and sockets. They can also be used to detect collisions and overlaps. It's the scene component that gives a base actor its physical representation in the scene. An actor itself has got no intrinsic transform but it does have a root component which is a simple scene component giving us our scene representation.",
