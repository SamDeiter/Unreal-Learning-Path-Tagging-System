  "text": " Now before we get started on the displacement part of our landscape material, I want to talk really quick about how this works. First off, in order to actually use this, you are going to need to go to the details panel of your material and then under Nanite, enable the enable tessellation checkmark box. That's going to enable the displacement input on your material. Now under displacement in the details panel, there's also a magnitude and a center. What these two properties do is control the steepness and kind of the center or the high and the low points of your displacement. So for example, if we were to take the center and set this to a value of one, what we would what would end up happening is we'd get something like this far image. The entire displacement would be actually shifted up as we start to move the center down the from say value of one to point five all the way down to point one. We're actually going to be shifting or offsetting the displacement. So here in the middle, we have a value of point five and then here we have a value of one and the point five value looks and works pretty well with this content. The magnitude on the other hand, this is going to control the steepness of your displacement. So if we have a low magnitude, we'll have kind of kind of high bumps, kind of not really that big. If we start to increase the magnitude really, really, really big, then we're going to get some really, really large features. We can also control our displacement through our material by multiplying our end displacement by some value to control over that. So for our material, what I have found throughout testing and building this is that if we set the magnitude to one point and leave the center at point five with the content, we will get really good results. So let's go ahead and pop back over to our material now. So right here and then we get a click out of the out of have nothing selected and then we're going to come in here. We're going to look for our Nanite and then here enable tessellation. You can see here I get the displacement input and then right here under our displacement, we're going to set our magnitude to a value of one. And hit apply and then save. And what we're going to be doing inside of our material now is the following. We're going to basically take our dirt and our grass, copy them. We're going to change the channel, though, to the blue channel, because that is where the displacement is located inside of our mask. And unlike our other ones at the very end of our lerp before we go into our displacement, we are going to add a multiply and then a displacement amount to allow us to control that displacement inside of our material. So let's pop back here to the editor. Now, there we go. So we'll just take this grass tile, take all this code right up here, control C control V, move this down. And then we're going to rename this to D grass for displacement grass and then D dirt for displacement dirt. And we do need to change these textures. So that's just a matter of coming in here and selecting our grass and then doing that again for this one coming in here and selecting our rock. There we go. And then we're going to change this to the blue pin. So right there and then right there like so. And now we need to add our displacement control. So we're going to hold down the one key and click and we're going to right click on this convert to parameter and call this displacement amount. We're going to have this a value of one. And then to control this, we're going to hold down the M key. We're going to add a multiply and then we're going to have our displacement value go into here. And then we're going to have this go into our multiply like so. And then last but not least, we're going to come right up to our displacement and hit apply and save. All right. Fantastic. So what we're going to be doing next is we're going to be adding something called distance blending. Now, here is an example of distance blending in action. So this is the exact same location. And what it's using here on the left hand side is a texture that maps the entire resolution of the landscape to one texture. And while this is very performant and looks really good for the detail and the far distance, the detail that's very close to the camera and the mid ground doesn't really look all that great. It's actually very pixelated. We can actually even see the individual texels inside of that texture map. And that's just not very good. On the right hand side, we have the exact same setup, but we have this distance blending enabled. And what distance blending allows us to do is it allows us to basically take two different textures and have one texture displayed close to the camera and in the mid ground. And then the other texture displayed far off in the distance. And we're actually going to utilize this for our landscape material by creating the following material distance blending function. So what we're going to do is we're going to create a parameter and we're going to call that distance blend. And then there is a material function called distance blend. We're going to use that and plug that into our distance blend reroute. So let's go ahead and do that now. So inside of our material, we're going to just come over here to some area and I'm going to hold down again the one key on the keyboard and click. We're going to click on this and go convert to parameter. We're going to call this distance blend range. We're going to give this a default value of say 1000. And then what we're going to do is we're going to look for our distance blend by clicking into our graph. And there we go. Miss distance blend. And then we're going to take the output of this range and plug that right here like so. And then what we're going to do is we are going to click inside of here and we're going to look for a named. We're going to add a named reroute declaration node and we're going to call that distance blend. And then we're going to plug this in like so. So there we go. Just have a look at this and we'll recap this. What we did is we took that distance blend. We made a parameter by holding down one and left clicking to add the constant. Then we right clicked on it, converted it to a parameter, gave it a name of distance blend range and a default value of 1000. We then right clicked inside of our event graph to look for our distance blend function. And this allows us again to set that range. We connected our output here and then we added our named reroute declaration. Call that distance blend and plug these in like so. All right, so we are going to need to add some other commands here. We are going to make a far tile grass and a far tile dirt. And they're basically going to be exactly the same as our dirt tile and our grass tile. This is just going to be for things in the difference. And the main difference is that, again, we're going to change the name, but we're also going to change the default value to be something very, very small. And this is going to make the texture really large. Let's go ahead and do that now. So we're going to come over here and let's just grab these two nodes right here and we can control C, control V. And we'll just move them out of the way. And then what we're going to call this is we're just going to put in the word F A R underscore. What I'm actually going to do is I'm going to take this farm to copy it to my clipboard here. And then we're just going to do this. We're going to come here and we're going to go paste. So we get that far dirt tile. Oops, that E there. And then we're going to do the same thing for here. Grass tile. So we're going to call this far grass tile. And then we're going to do the same thing here. So there we go. We have now a far dirt tile and our far grass tile with the accompanying nodes. And now what we're going to do is we are going to grab basically set up our same slope like we have. But instead of it being dirt tile or grass tile, it's going to be called far dirt or far grass. And then what we're going to do is we're going to take both of these. We're going to take our near and our far. We're going to use a lerp node with our distance blend to blend between them. So again, let's go over to the editor and let's go ahead and set this up by first coming up here. We're going to grab these two up here. Right. I'm going to hit control C control V. We'll just move this up and we are going to have to get rid of these two because we want the far dirt tile and the far grass tile. So let's just put the dirt down here and the grass up here. So we're going to plug this in like so far dirt. And there is our I should say far grass. And we're going to call this one B.C. underscore far grass and B.C. underscore. Underscore far dirt. So there we go. And then we're going to take this lerp and I'm going to hit control C control V. All right. And we're going to take the output from this one and plug that into here. Then we're going to take the output from this one and plug it in like so. And then we're going to look for our named reroute of our distance blend and we're going to plug that in. And once that is done, we're going to plug this into our base color. So now what we have here, we just kind of move this out of the way a little bit, is we have again, let's go over this. So we have our far grass tile and our far grass and our far dirt tile and our far dirt. And again, we're using the lerp based off of the slope. So whatever we set here for the slope will determine where these are set on or should say where these are shown on our landscape. And then for our near grass and our near dirt, what we're going to do is the same thing. We have B.C. grass, B.C. dirt. We're using this linear interpolate along with our slope to mix the two. And finally, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking these two and then using our lerp again to show one in the distance and one in the foreground. And finally, plug that into our base color. So what I want everybody to do now is to repeat this process and we will be back with creating a new level, which will allow us to test some of this before we go further.",
