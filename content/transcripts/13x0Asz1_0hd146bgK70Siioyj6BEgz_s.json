  "text": " And then looking at alpha information on thinking about optimizing textures. So we want to look at the difference between some kind of foliage and on the alpha channel we've got the masking for that foliage so that you can you know not see that green background and it renders properly as a bush for example versus adding another texture so an alpha texture to the opacity mask and what the trade-off is between adding an extra texture sample versus just packing it into your alpha channel. So if we look at the embedded alpha versus a separate alpha we're getting a higher visual fidelity from the separate alpha it is including an extra texture but again it's the trade-off between do you want your alpha maps on a separate texture sample and you can pack these all into one RGB texture sample or do you want to embed the alpha inside of that one texture so if we go back to the previous slide you have the RGB going straight into the base color and then the alpha channel is packed into that alpha so that we can plug it into Whereas on the second separate alpha example we are just using the R channel to have our opacity mask so again it's an extra texture map but you can compress them in such a way whereas if we go to the next slide that we can compress without alpha if we tick that box then we're making some affordances for our texture so that in our channels in Photoshop or whatever package you might be using we can just see the RGB channels that we've not got an alpha channel so therefore we can make some affordances to say okay compress this without an alpha channel we can have our compression settings as masks no sRGB and then just make sure the sRGB isn't checked and therefore when we go to see the incorrect versus correct with the sRGB disabling you can see that there's a crispness to the correct side which is the right hand side if we're looking at maybe some of the small branch detail or just anywhere there's those extra little details with the branches coming out you can see that when it's incorrect Unreal is trying to optimize things but it's not doing a great job at trying to figure out the rendering here because it's missing some crucial information that just makes that asset look correct so it's good to consider how you're packing your alpha channels and which approach you're taking whether you're packing them into the one texture sample or using a different alpha to set that opacity",
