  "text": " For this next section, we're going to dive very deep into our cameras, in particular, talking about the difference between our game camera and our cinema cameras. So a game camera is traditionally what the player uses to view the world, to play through the world, right? When you play a game, you are possessing that character or, you know, if you're doing like a third person or top down, right? That camera is the camera into the world and what the player sees through. So traditionally we use these game camera actors. In fact, if I go back to the editor, kind of work over in this section here, I'm going to go up to my windows, place actors, and I'm just going to simply search for camera. And you see here is our camera actor. All right, now I'll move this up. So you see there's our camera actor. Move this up and it does in fact look blue. So taking just a quick look over in our details panel here, you'll see that we have our camera. And for the camera settings, it's very basic. We have a projection mode. So go perspective or orthographic. Our field of view, which you should be familiar with. Obviously, if it's smaller, it's a tighter field of view. And if we go up, it's much wider. And we have our aspect ratios. You can see as I change this, I can make it wider or skinnier. Now beyond this, we have a few camera options and we have the ability to do some post processing. Now we're not going to cover post processing in this class. But the important thing to note here is that we don't really have a lot of traditional cinema controls that we'll see here in just a second with our cinema camera actor. And that is by design. This camera is meant to be a very basic camera because again in traditional games, we're not really looking to overload a lot of post processing effects or special different on screen visuals. We simply just want a camera that's looking into our world that the player can play through. Now I'm going to take a note real quick. We have this constrained aspect ratio. We'll talk about this in a little bit, but just know that it's within our details panel. All right. So this is going to be just our regular game camera. Go ahead and press escape. And I'm going to drag in a cinema camera actor. Let's go ahead and pull this up. And you'll notice that the visuals are different, right? Here we have our gray camera opposed to the blue. And if we go over to our details panel, you'll see that we actually start to have a lot more control, which all of these controls are intrinsically tied to real world counterparts to traditional cameras and cinematography. So for example, we have our film back. I'll expand these out and you see we can start playing with sensor widths. There are some presets here, but know that you can always override these to do custom. But these are just some presets based off of again, traditional film, traditional cameras and the way they operate. Our lens setting, you'll see that we actually now started to talk about f-stops. We're talking about focal lengths. This is important to understand too, that if you've ever looked at that rich cinema feel, right, we've got this beautiful depth of field. In fact, let me take the camera and we'll kind of move it down. And you'll see we're starting to get some of that. In fact, let's go ahead and just focus in on this little bush up here. Right. So the bush is slightly fuzzy and then it starts to take a little bit more in focus. And right now, in fact, if I turn on, I'm going to go back to our focus settings here, turn on our draw debug focus plane. And as I kind of drag this in, we should see it come into focus. So this is going to be where the camera is focusing. So if I zoom in to kind of put it right in the middle of this little plant here and uncheck it, you'll see now the actual plant is in focus and the background is blurred. Right. So it feels very cinematic, feels like a real camera. And that is by design. So without going through all of these various different settings within the cinema camera, it's important to note again from a very just high level simplistic kind of explanation of this is that our blue camera is going to be a very simple camera and then our gray camera is going to be our very cinematic. So hopefully that makes sense. So inside of our sequence, traditionally speaking, we're going to want to use this cinema camera because again, we're going to want to take advantage of all of those really high details. Now you could use a player camera. That's completely fine. But for the cinema camera actor, it's going to allow us to do again, those depth of field is going to allow us to do focus tracking, a lot more controls that typically speaking, we're going to want to have when building out our sequences. So a couple of things to note, as I had mentioned, one of the important things is this constrain aspect ratio. So it's important to note, I don't know if you've played a game before and you're playing your game and let's say that you have an ultra wide, you have a much wider field of view. And if a game has been made to where you go into that sequence and you have these black bars on the side, that's probably because the sequence itself, which we can specify the ratio within our camera was probably set up as a 16 by nine. So if you use your camera and you uncheck constrain aspect ratio for users that have a non 16 by nine ratio monitor or whatever they're viewing it on, it'll actually allow it to stretch to the full length. So just keep that in mind in your back pocket as you're building these. It's a very simple button that we can or toggle that we can just check on or off to be able to get rid of those black bars on the side. We talked about our film back. So again, this is going to be our sensor, our width and height. We talked about various different lens settings, our focus settings. Now if I jump over to our sequence real quick and I'm going to go ahead and stretch out our timeline here, you'll see that we have a couple of different shots. So we have this one where it's following and then we have our second shot, which you'll notice is actually tracking with the player. And that's because we've enabled look at tracking with our camera to track this particular character as he moves across the screen. And then here you'll see we also have some various different lens settings. Our focus is directly on this NPC for lack of better terms. And you'll see this blurred in the background. And again, that's something that we can take advantage of by using a cinema camera as opposed to just a regular camera. And then finally, we talked briefly that within the cameras themselves, we do have post processing effects. Now something just to throw in your back pocket to keep in mind is I don't typically recommend using post processing on the camera, but rather using a post processing volume with that. The advantage that you have there is say, for example, that you set up a camera with a specific lens ratio, a specific f stop, right? Like a camera that you want to use quite often throughout an entire sequence or multiple sequences by decoupling your post processing volume. It means that you can swap in different cameras or you can change things out as needed and you're not locked to just having those post processing settings on that one specific camera. So just keep that in mind that you can still do all the same post processing effects through a post processing volume. But as a handy feature, we have some of those post processing things directly on the camera itself. So just keep that in mind. The other thing to keep in mind here is that as we're building out our sequence, we can have multiple cameras. In fact, if we jump back over to our sequence, you'll see here we actually we have our three So CCA1, 02 and 03. In fact, these exist in our world. So let me go ahead and just delete the example cameras we have here. So I'll select my CCA1, press F to frame you to see there is that camera. CCA02 is down here. So you see that we can have multiple cameras within our scene. Now within each of these shots, we can actually associate those with a particular camera. So if I right click and go to properties, you'll see here camera binding ID. Now fun fact pro tip here, if you've ever opened up a sequence and you get this red bar around there saying the camera binding has been deassociated, but you're looking at your scene and you're like, but wait, my camera is in the scene. What's happened? It happens occasionally. All you need to do is go back into the shot itself and rebind your camera and all the key should still be there and it should work like normal. But just a couple other cameras to keep in mind, we do have the scene capture component 2D, which is a special type of camera that allows us to essentially capture our scene and render what is being fed into that camera to a texture. In fact, this is one of the cameras that used if you're trying to capture like HDRI cubes within your editor. Yes, that is the thing that you can do. It is awesome. And you use this to use this camera essentially to be the eyes in the world, the position, and then you will capture whatever it's seen and render it to a texture. We also have a cinema capture component 2D. Now this is new as a caveat. It is in beta mode as a 5.3. So just kind of keep this in mind. But it essentially just extends the capabilities of the capture component to allow for a few other nice visual effects such as our post-processing, OCIO and lens distortion. And then we also have a V cam actor. Now this is outside of essentially what we're doing for this particular class. But as I had mentioned in our plugins, there are different things that we can use. So say for example, we can use the Apple AR kit to capture your face via motion capture. We can use motion capture suits as well. And one of the other really cool features is by leveraging an Apple device such as a iPad or an iPhone, we can actually transmit the location, rotation, position information of that iOS device. Also works for Android, but iOS is more supported. We can translate that information directly in engine to a camera actor, in this case using a V cam actor through the Live Link plugin. This is an amazing tool to use. So if you are familiar with traditional film, one of the things that makes something feel more natural as opposed to synthetic is the camera movement, right? Traditionally when a film is working, right? It's either on a operator's shoulder or it's on a dolly or a track. And there's these very subtle movements that you get, whether it's from the mechanicals of the camera itself moving along the track or the operator's slight movements that we've grown accustomed to as we've watched film over the years. All that to say, so you can use a V cam actor coupled with say for example, an iPad and actually record all of that information and essentially do the camera movements with that iPad and you see it in real time. It's amazing tool. Absolutely worth looking into. We're not going to do this for this class, but just keep that in mind.",
