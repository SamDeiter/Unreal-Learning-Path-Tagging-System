  "text": " Hi and welcome to this session on Visualization for Architectural Exteriors. My name is Amer Yassine and I will be your instructor today. Today we'll take a look at building an exterior scene together. The outline will take us through the initial setup and how to work with templates and levels. We'll also discuss the concept of streaming levels along the way. We'll then start building the environment by placing bits and pieces to place residential dwellings around the plaza. We'll experiment with various ways to adjust the sunlight in the scene, as well as adding foliage to the environment in the shape of trees, grass and bushes. Post-processing effects will allow us to tune the scene, much to our satisfaction, and we will also adjust the sun effects for ray streaks and better shadows. Finally, we will add human characters to bring the scene to life, and learn to capture high-resolution stills to output to disk. In order to follow along, you should have downloaded and extracted a zip archive that gives you access to an Unreal project file and most necessary assets that you need. I say most because if you want to include human characters in the scene, then you also need to download a free Marketplace pack to that end. Simply use the Epic Games launcher to go to Marketplace and do a search for Scanned 3D People pack and download it. It is a free pack that gets added to your vault. Later, you'll be able to access it when we get to that step. Once you have done that, you are ready to start. Find the AEC Exterior 427.U project file and double-click it to start your journey.",
