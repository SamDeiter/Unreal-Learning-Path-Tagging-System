  "text": " Now that we have all of our controls created, what we can do is we can use the tag function, or tag node, should I say, to actually colour our controls, as well as set up the FK chain function in the forward solve in a moment. So what I'm going to do here is drag off the item of our spawn transform controls node and search for add tag. And under the tag drop down, I'm just going to open it up and type controls, because the item that we're plugging in here is all of the controls that we're creating based on the bone names. And you'll see when I connect up the logic, that controls fills in in white. And what we'll do over the left hand side here is actually tag all of our bones that we're finding. Again, so we can use that with the FK chain function with the forward solve logic. So if I drag off the element of the foreach, search for add tag again. Under the tag heading we'll type bones, because this is going to be all of our bones, and just insert it in the logic between. It doesn't have to be here, but it's just a bit neater than doing it at the end. Now the first thing we can do is use this information of our control tag to colour the controls. So if I right click, search for colourize controls. What this looks for is an array of controls to then colour based on their position. So the position is based on which of these plane options you tick. So in our case, the X plane works perfectly for us. We'll see in just a moment. And you can actually change the colour of what you'd like each control to be, at the centre, left or right, just inside the details panel there. But to find all of our controls with the tag controls, if we right click, search for find items with tag, and then under the tag heading we'll search for controls. And if we connect that up, and then connect our logic up, you'll see that we get a bit of a warning here. And this is just to do with the default limits in the class settings, or the node run limit and the procedural element limit. So to fix that, if you come up to class settings here, and search for limit, what we're going to do is just increase each of these to 10,000. And you should see if we compile, yeah, we no longer get those warnings. So if you have a rig that has a lot of elements, you might find that you hit up against this node run limit. If you do, again, just jump inside the class settings and make a change to those limits. Just something suitable depending on how many sort of warnings you're getting. So we now have a control created for every bone in our skeleton. The only thing that's missing is connecting up the controls to the bones so that when we move the controls, the bones move along with them. So you see if I move this right now, the controls are coming along too because they're in the hierarchy, but we've not connected to the bones yet so our skeletal mesh isn't moving yet. And we're going to do that with the FK chain function. So if I just bring this down here and give us some more space. Search for FK chain. Now all this function looks for is an array of bones and an array of controls. So earlier we tagged our bones in our controls. So we tagged our bones here and we tagged our controls at the end. And what we want to do is search for those tags to use as the information to feed into the FK chain. So if we right click and search for find items with tag. I'll just duplicate this so we have two of them. Now the tag we're going to look for first is bones and we'll connect up the bones arrays there. And then we'll search for controls and connect up the controls arrays. Now if we connect up the logic and just hit compile, what we can see here is if we move one of the bones, we'll see that we've now connected up the controls to the bones. And that's really as simple as it is to create your FK rig. So we're finding all of the bones within our skeleton. We're then sorting out the hierarchy based on the bone names and adding underscore control to the end. We're then setting the location of our, or the transforms of our controls based on the transforms of the bones. And we're utilising the tags to both colour the controls automatically and connect up the bones to the controls in the forward solve to actually be able to animate this character. Now something really cool we can do here is actually change our preview mesh to be a different character. So for example something like this bungee man. And you can see that automatically all these controls get recreated based on the hierarchy of the bones of the new skeleton. And they're all connected again. So any that we want to move here you'll see that that moves our mesh. And it doesn't have to be just biped characters. It can also be things like cardboard box that we have in the system here in the project. So any of these controls are all connected and created again automatically just based on the logic that we have set up here to read the bone information and generate a control for each bone.",
