  "text": " Okay, so now that we know what PBR is, it's time for us to take a look at what primary nodes and textures we'll be using in order to actually adhere to the PBR pipeline. So the topics that we'll be covering on this are the primary PBR inputs that we'll be using, material settings and textures that we'll be using for PBR. So when it comes to the primary PBR inputs, the inputs that we're going to be using are base color, metallic, specular and roughness. We'll take a look at these individually so that we have a better idea of what's what. So base color first. Sometimes you'll hear it referred to as albedo, but it's essentially flat color without any specularity or any shading whatsoever, as you can see here in this example. The textures are vector 3, so RGB, the values of each one of those channels will go between 0 and 1. And just as a rule of thumb, it's best to avoid pure black and pure white as they don't really exist in nature. So whenever you're making textures for this kind of stuff, try to avoid pure black and pure white. Then we have metallic, which is a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1. So in this case, no RGB or any of that type of information. It's just how metallic are you, so from 0 to 1. The usual usage is for it to be on or off, so 1 or 0. So you're essentially telling the engine whether something's metallic or dielectric. So when on, it yields a 100% specular reflection, so that's something to keep in mind. So when it comes to roughness, just like metallic, it's a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1. But in this case, it ranges from like a smooth mirror-like surface at 0 to a rough surface at 1. So for the roughness at 0, we have something mirror-like, really shiny. With the roughness of 1, we have a matte surface. So this isn't like metallic where you have 0 or 1 tell it to be on or off. In this case, you are encouraged to fine-tune the roughness and use the entire range between 0 and 1 because you might want something to look a little bit more or less shiny. You're not just defining whether something is mirror-like or rough. So the next section here is the specular. Now, this is something that you're not really always going to have to touch, but just like metallic and roughness, it's a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1. And a good rule of thumb is to just set specular to a value of 0.5 and then fine-tune the roughness instead to actually get the right shininess for your material. By default, Unreal Engine sets this to 0.5. So really, there's not really that many instances in which you actually have to edit this, but we can take a look at it down the line. In some cases, you might decide to actually edit the specular value to actually push for more stylized looks. So if you want over-the-top glossiness or anything like that. So sometimes you might want to push the values of specularity to achieve certain looks. But as I say, most of the times, you'll just be able to get the look that you want by just tweaking the roughness and leaving this at 0.5 on default. So when it comes to the textures that we're actually going to use, Unreal Engine supports a wide variety of formats. Of those, uncompressed formats are BMP, TGA, PSD, and EXR. Another compressed format is PNG, JPEG, DDS, HDR, and UDIM if you're using virtual texturing. It's important to know that not all textures are just 2D normal textures. Some are cubemaps and also TIFF and the two TIFF formats are also supported. I would recommend that you just stick to PNG for most of the time, unless you're using a very specific type of texture, since it will keep the size of your projects really lightweight, really small. And also, it has the ability to include transparency information, so that's actually really handy. When it comes to how to import textures into Unreal, a rule of thumb or a rule you need to keep in mind is that you should always try and import power of two textures. So when each one of the dimensions, an X and Y, a power of two. So from 16 by 16 all the way to 8K to 8K. They don't have to be square as long as they are a power of two. So you can't have a 2048 by 1024 texture. It's just that you can't have any one of those dimensions be something that isn't a power of two. This would affect how texture streaming is handled and memory management, because if they're not power of two, they just don't get looked into for texture streaming. And one other thing to keep in mind is that high frequency information on the textures can cause anti-aliasing artifacts, so that's something to keep in mind as well when creating your textures. So when it comes to actually creating your textures and seeing how they compress once they're in Engine, you can access the MIP generation settings or the texture pyramids. And you just have to double click on the texture, drop down and just check how the MIP maps are actually being generated. But we can take a look at this in the actual Engine. So how do we import textures? Let's go ahead and take a look at that. So I'm going to bring up the Engine. And there's a couple of ways you can do it. You can use the import button here. So go to wherever you want it in your content browser, press import and find the texture wherever you want it. Or even simpler, if you have the folder where you want this open, you can just click and drag into the folder that you want it. And you can see my texture has been imported right here. Just to take a look at a couple of the texture settings that you have available to you, you can double click the texture and then you can see each channel individually. So RGB. And if there's no alpha, you won't have access to it. And then other texture settings here that we don't have to get to in detail with. But for example, you can decide whether you want to use sRGB or not. You can change the compression settings. And just like I mentioned earlier, you can also change the way the MIPS are generated. So, you know, depending on the size of the texture on screen at the time that it's loaded or actual algorithm or compression you actually want to use when it comes to the MIB Gen settings.",
