  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson, we're going to do a brief overview of the Megascans tool to be able to make layered textures and some things to look out for. So let's get started. So to be able to make a blended material using Megascans, you have to keep some things in mind. One of them, you got to make sure of course that you do need to be logged into Quixel Bridge and have the latest, but also when you're working with your materials to make sure the materials are the latest or the newest type materials. Now, the reason why, if I chose an older material and say I've already downloaded it and maybe it's inside of my system, like, oh, you know, Megascans, what do we have? Megascans wise, I don't think I have any Megascans in this particular example. Oh, there we go. And we have Megascans. We'll go to our surfaces here and say I got a coal mine. If it is a older material and it's paired with an also an older material, these are both kind of old, a clover deal. It would actually work pretty well. But if I decided to go to a brand new released material, say this one, it would be very difficult to be able to get these and download them and have them in my scene. And then once they're selected, get them into the blending because the way they're structured from old to new is very different. The newer versions are a lot more efficient in being able to customize the material. The older ones, not quite as much. And when you try to pair them together, Quixel Bridge can get confused. And you'll see it here in the interface. There's a little kind of like a bar to be able to change values in here. This used to be able to be a different setting where you can actually control some more details about what you're getting. Now it kind of is turned into the button that takes us to how to blend and maybe switch a 3D master material and so forth. So if you wanted to, you would want to select a couple of materials that you would need and you would say create a material blend and you can do that through your content browser. So I could choose maybe the clover here, click on that interface again and say, hey man, I'm going to create a material that I want to blend. Now you got to make sure that they are selected. So I would have to like kind of make sure they're in the same kind of folder or something. That's actually nice because then you'll know which ones you've blended and you would select them at the same time and then you would make your blended material. So they need to be selected in your content browser, clicking this interface and then you will say, collect, create material blend and it will put it in. It will call it material blend and it will put it where you want to put it. So you can create a folder for it, which should work just fine. Now again, the caveat is just a reminder. If you have a brand new new surface material, like in this new surface category, and I have something old like this grass and clover leaf that may not match up. So when you try to blend them, you may get an error and may just say it did it, but it's just blank. I've had that doesn't quite work. And I personally don't prefer this method and I'll show you why, because it really just does a fade, which can easily be done the old school way or the new school way. And you don't necessarily need Quixel Bridge to do it for you. So let me show you what I mean. So I'm going to click on this particular material, I'm going to double click on it, open it up and you'll see that we have our wood and clover already kind of blended together, but it's blended in such a way that it just kind of fades into each other. So I'll see that I have a layer base albedo color that I can control and a few other things, but we also have base layer rotation angle and normal strength so I can push normals through if I wanted to. And you'll see here, even with the normals, it's really just fading into each other is all it's doing. We can do the roughness here if we wanted to pull in the roughness from one to the other. And it's really again stacked in such a way that it's simply just fading into each other. And you can see that we can move one away than the other middle layer normal strength. Get that UV control back to zero. And that's really all it does. It's nothing necessarily to write home about. It's nothing you can't do on your own if you wanted to. So it's really up to you how you build it. I don't necessarily prefer this way. We can turn on the top layer here. But this is really how you want to do it. Now I don't have more than just one. You can choose more than just one or two and even add a puddle layer if you wanted to. There's no aspect for it to reach out for that in here that's detailed in that way. But that's kind of how this system works. Again, it's nothing you can't do with the old system and the new system. So I don't necessarily recommend it because again, it's easy to forget your old material versus your new material and you could run into that major hurdle. All right. So that's it with this video. I just wanted to point that out that that option is there and some of those caveats in the next video, we're going to start breaking down how to create this type of layered material, which is our new way of being able to control and create layered materials. Thanks again.",
