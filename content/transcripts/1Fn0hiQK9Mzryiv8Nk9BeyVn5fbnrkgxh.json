  "text": " Great. Now we have the theory out of the way, let's jump into the engine and have a look at some of these examples. Now, the first way of making a material interactive, this actually isn't going to require us to do any coding at all, except for within the material itself. Now, let me demonstrate this to start off with. I'm coming up to example six here, camera distance. If I was to just press play, now you would see here we have a bridge, a bridge which appears as the character moves across it. You can see here we've got the bridge. You can see that as we get closer, the bridge just moves into place, giving us this nice dynamic effect. Another example of the same sort of functionality working in the same way would be this door here. As I get close, the door opens and as I get far away, the door closes. Now, this can be done in a number of different ways, but what I'm using here, and I'll jump into the material. So what you can see here is I'm using primarily the world position offset. The only other thing I've got is the world position offset. The only other thing I've got, I've got nothing else plugged in here, really. I played around with the base color and a couple other odds and sods. But the world position offset is the only thing that I'm really using. Now, I am lerping between the A. So you must have come across a lerp by now, but what a lerp will do is depending on the alpha, if the value that comes into the alpha is either going to provide, it's either going to provide the value from A. If the alpha is zero, if the alpha is one, it will provide the value from B. And if the alpha is 0.5, it will provide halfway between these two values. So you can see what I'm doing here, world position offset. This allows me to move the vertices. If it's zero or one, it's going to be in its original position. However, if the value is at B, it's going to create a location far away. I've got a couple of rather more clever things that I'm doing here. For example, I'm using the world position to generate a random value, meaning that each of the instances will have a different value. So they'll all move to a different location. I'm adding some random rotation. And I'm using the sine wave to make this bob up and down. Now, what I'm doing here is this is plugging into the alpha, but I am looking at the distance between the object position and the camera position. Getting the distance, I'm doing a little bit of maths and clamping it to zero to one so it doesn't go over or under the values. So as the camera gets closer to the object's position, it's going to provide us a different value between zero and one. And that's what will allow us to learn. And so you can see here, as I move further away in the viewport, it moves off to a random location. So this is the sort of simplest example of it. We have all we've done in this large section is generated a bobbing up and down random location, and then based off the distance of the camera, we are moving between those two points. Now, we're effectively doing the same thing with the door, but it's a little bit more complicated. Do feel free to check out the material here in order to see how that works.",
