  "text": " Hi, in this video we're going to cover setting up MetaHumans for a live performance capture session. So, we're going to set up the Live Link blueprint for body data and then we'll go over the setup for facial data using the Live Link Face app and an iPhone. So the first thing that I want to do is add my MotionBuilder Live Link source here. I've got MotionBuilder running in the background and it's just streaming a range of motion take for us just to make sure that our blueprints are working. So I like to add that first so that I can make sure that I've got my settings right and that the stream is coming through okay. So the first thing I'm going to do is go to add a source here and then grab the message bus source and Mobu Live Link will be under that. So I've got my MetaHuman male skeleton coming through but he's not moving yet so we need to set a couple things up. So the first thing that we want to do and this is just a basic Unreal level and I've got my MetaHuman master blueprint. This is Cooper and I just built him and downloaded him from Quixel Bridge and brought him into this project. So I'm going to go into his blueprint and edit it. So the only thing I need to do to this master blueprint is add a Live Link skeletal animation component and this will enable this MetaHuman to receive Live Link data. So we're going to compile it and then we'll go back to our level here and now we need to grab his body component and right now it's set to use an animation blueprint which is correct and it's pointed to the male medium normal weight and a blueprint. So we're going to hit our magnifying glass and we're going to edit this. So we're going here and the only thing we need to do to this blueprint is add a Live Link pose node in between this first input pose node and the control rig node. So we add it here and since we've got Live Link coming in over here in our anim blueprint now we'll see the MetaHuman male skeleton as a choice. So we select that and as soon as we hit compile we see this start to move around. So we know that this blueprint is working correctly. So we'll go back into our stream map and sure enough he's moving around. So the body is working correctly. One thing to note about the MetaHumans is some of the MetaHumans just have slightly different deformations than the other ones. So if you happen to see some deformations that don't look correct on the MetaHuman that you've brought into your project you can grab the body component here and it would be worth trying to turn on this disable post process blueprint. On this particular MetaHuman it doesn't make any difference but on some of the MetaHumans you will see the deformations improve if you disable this post process blueprint when you're streaming live data onto them. So that's just one thing to check if it doesn't look right for you. So now we'll go on to setting the face up. So I like to turn the body off when I'm setting the face up so that I don't have to chase the character around the scene. So to do that I'm just going to turn off this incoming data on the MetaHuman male skeleton. His body will stop moving and now we can focus on the face. So I'll just boot up the Live Link Face app on my iPhone and as soon as I do that if it's set up correctly it'll automatically pop in here to our source window. So now that we've got that all we need to do is we're going to grab the face component here and this is very similar to the body. It's driven by a blueprint as well so we're going to browse to that asset. Double click in here we're going to start we're going to edit his face and MVP. The only thing we need to change here is if we grab this variable the Live Link Face subject and we're going to come over here to its default value. We're going to drop this down and pick the iPhone face. So as soon as we select that since that matches our incoming data in the Live Link window or matches the name you'll see his face start to move. So we're going to compile here go back to our map deselect him so he's easier to see and we've got live face data coming through. So now we can go back to our Live Link window here turn on the body skeleton and now we've got body and face working live and we're ready to capture some takes.",
