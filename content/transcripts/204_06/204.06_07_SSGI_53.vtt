00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at screen space and global illumination.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.799
So let's get started.

3
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.280
So screen space global illumination can be activated within our project settings and

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.120
also within the Puzz process volume.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.120
Let me point out where those are at and then we're going to look at a few things we can

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.600
do to actually do a little quality control and things to look out for, especially if

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.839
you're using it for ICVFX.

8
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.600
So in my scene here, what I want to do is first go into my project settings.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.039
Again, you can activate this after the fact if you want to, but in your project settings,

10
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.039
if your intentions are to use it, it's good to actually have it on anyway.

11
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.159
So we would go underneath and take a look at our settings here.

12
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.519
You'll see under reflection method, we have screen space global illumination active.

13
00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.560
We have overall we have ray tracing in here.

14
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.960
And that's because if we want to use GPU, if we want to use GPU light mask, we actually

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200
want to turn this on and make sure that it is on.

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.320
If you don't have this on, it won't work.

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.000
So it's using ray tracing in this particular case, but we can also use screen space.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.240
If we wanted to for our GI, you just have to be careful if you decide to do that, even

19
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.920
in your overrides, you have to keep those things in mind.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.280
Screen space will give you a bit of a clipping that could occur if you're using it for ICVFX.

21
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.359
So you've got to be aware of that because when you move your camera, you can see glowing

22
00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:34.439
objects and certain materials start to clip away and you'll have to do a bit of an over scan.

23
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.200
Let's talk about that.

24
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.719
So it's not necessarily the norm to use this type of effect.

25
00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.420
And again, you can see the two areas where we can turn it on.

26
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.219
If you decide to use it in your scene and maybe you're not using GPU light mask and you're

27
00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.579
using regular CPU bake, you again want to change that in your global illumination settings.

28
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.420
And they can also be done in your post process volume.

29
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.780
But just keep in mind, if your scene isn't very big, that might be okay.

30
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.780
But if it's a large scene, it takes a while to bake for updates needed by the director.

31
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.420
That might be a little bit of a problem.

32
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.219
So if you do decide to use it though, in that context, you want to go into your, your NDC

33
00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.939
in your NDC, you want to go to your viewport over scan.

34
00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.379
And in here, you want to make sure that you're making it just a little bit bigger than your

35
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.379
area of interest.

36
00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.819
And this is going to be very important because as you move your camera around, like I said

37
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.579
before, your, if you don't do this, you can actually get clipping on the edges of your

38
00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.579
camera.

39
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.900
So you want to make sure you over scan that just a bit so that that clipping does not occur

40
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.419
at the edge of your camera.

41
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.339
If we go to Unreal, we can see here a viewport over scan option here.

42
00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.859
And we also have viewport screen percentages.

43
00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.179
So we can actually change these as we need.

44
00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.459
There's the main wall.

45
00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.419
So we can enable this if we need to over scan and choose how much we want to shift things.

46
00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.959
Same thing with the sidewall and same thing with the wild wall.

47
00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.239
This is up to you how you do so.

48
00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.060
Just keep this in mind that it is a good idea to over scan if you are going to use this

49
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.939
method.

50
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.740
Rating space also has several quality settings that you can enable using the following commands.

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.180
In using your console variable, you can use r.ssgi for quality and using number between

52
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.060
one and four to control that quality.

53
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.740
You'll see the number chart that I placed in the lecture here.

54
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.419
It says one is ray steps eight, ray count four, two, ray steps eight, ray count eight,

55
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:39.459
three, ray steps eight, ray count 16, and four here, ray steps 12, and ray count 32.

56
00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.739
So the resolution command to render at half resolution is dart.ssgi for half res.

57
00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.979
To use previous frames seeing color to achieve better quality results, you can use r.ssgi

58
00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.939
for minimum illuminance.

59
00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.939
So these are things that you can use.

60
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.259
Remember these number counts between one and four for quality control here is at the top,

61
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:07.219
but these ray counts you do need to keep in mind exactly what it is you're going for,

62
00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.900
what your visuals are going to be, and if you're going to over scan overall.

63
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.420
Now again, using screens, physical illumination isn't the typical norm.

64
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.180
Typically you would use Lumen and just adjust your materials and build your scene accordingly.

65
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.379
This is an option for possibly maybe lower end machines or you're maybe running to situations

66
00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.300
where the noise is a bit too much.

67
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.620
You may then want to switch to this and it's actually a pretty cheap way to use things.

68
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.699
And let me show you a few things to keep in mind if you decide to use it.

69
00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.420
So in this case, we'll just pretend ours is on.

70
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.780
Right now we're currently using ray tracing for our GI and I'm in the secondary post

71
00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.500
process volume reference.

72
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.579
If you are looking this and downloading this for the class,

73
00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:56.699
I'm just using this particular lot one that's already been loaded.

74
00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.299
So in here, you'll see that we can actually go to our advanced settings and when we have it on.

75
00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.139
And let's see if we can just go ahead and pop this on real quick.

76
00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.219
We want to Lumen, we're going to do a screen space in this case.

77
00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.859
Let's see things shift a little bit.

78
00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:17.299
You can correct your indirect lighting color and your indirect lighting intensity.

79
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.819
So these things can be controlled.

80
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.060
You see a little bit of a popping going on here.

81
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.340
And you also see a little bit of a color shift if I choose to.

82
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.139
Now this is contained within our post process volume, but this is up to you and it may conflict

83
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.300
a bit with our light.

84
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.540
But you have that option to be able to control this on a very low level.

85
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.139
And you'll see a little bit of brightness going on if you were to use it.

86
00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.980
And these overrides work pretty well.

87
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.340
I'm going to set that to none.

88
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.220
I'm going to put that as method, turn that off in general and turn these off too.

89
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.420
But the advanced area is where you're going to get the ability to be able to control the

90
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.100
brightness of that if you decided to go in this direction.

91
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.020
Typically when you use SSGI, you want to make sure that you're using it in such a way so

92
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.220
that it's complimentary to previously baked items that you have in your scene.

93
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.220
That's typically what it's used with.

94
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.980
Does that mean you can't use it with ray tracing?

95
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.580
Well, you actually can.

96
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.740
And for some reason you're using ray tracing and you're noticing it's very slowing.

97
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.139
It's slowing down greatly.

98
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.180
Your brute force seems to be bringing things to a crawl.

99
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.579
Maybe you're not on stage.

100
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.900
Maybe it's just simply for virtual production or final pixel.

101
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.660
You can switch into your global illumination to be screen space in general.

102
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.340
And that would actually make things go a little bit smoother.

103
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.740
Just keep in mind the difference between those because you can keep ray trace reflections on

104
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.379
and use screen space in that particular scenario.

105
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.420
Again, you want to be able to block this out.

106
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.300
You want to make sure things are exactly the way that you want ahead of time.

107
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.340
So just be very deterministic, but typically it's used as a complementary tool

108
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.620
for your baking scenarios.

109
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.860
That's it with this lecture.

110
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.540
Here's a link here for you to dive in deeper on these particular topics.

111
00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:55.460
Thanks again.

112
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.660
And in the next video, we're going to go and take a look at ICVFX

113
00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.340
when it comes to ray tracing as a bit of a review.
