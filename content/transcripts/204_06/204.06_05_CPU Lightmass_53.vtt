00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.759
In this lesson, we're going to go ahead and take a look at Lightmass, baking, CPU and GPU.

2
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.040
So let's get started.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.240
So CPU, Lightmass and GPU can be used for baking.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to mainly focus here up front on CPU baking.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.039
And both of those are kind of the old school way to be able to bake out your lighting in

6
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.039
a scene.

7
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.280
Now, Lumen will update on the fly because the lights are dynamic and Lumen is dynamic

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.560
and updates in real time.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.000
But when it comes to CPU baking, particularly we and GPU, you have to actually go in here

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.679
and set up your lights accordingly, bake out your lights, and then you'll get the desired

11
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.920
look and feel for your scene.

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.880
Now it's very important.

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.320
There's several ways that are several things you need to keep in mind when working with

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.320
this.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320
And I will point these out.

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.920
You want to anticipate your needs for sure when it comes to working with your scene ahead

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.679
of time because baking will take some time, especially if your scene is large.

18
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.200
Now GPU baking, GPU Lightmass baking does beat up the process.

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.840
But again, you have to come in with a strategy and a game plan to be able to actually work

20
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.319
a little bit more efficient.

21
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:18.280
And say you have to bake on set, immediately you want to make sure that you know exactly

22
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.240
what you need and want, especially if changes are coming in pretty hot and heavy.

23
00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:25.879
Now Lumen is a more ideal approach.

24
00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:29.479
But again, I want to cover this because there may be some times when you're like, Lumen's

25
00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.519
doing great, but we just can't seem to get rid of noise in this particular area.

26
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:38.319
And that's when you can lean upon your CPU and GPU baking.

27
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.199
So you always want to start low and then go high.

28
00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:47.359
And you want to keep things at a medium level when it comes to static lighting level scale.

29
00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.879
This details gives you details of your Lightmass.

30
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:55.679
Remember of indirect, your indirect lighting bounces, keep that low.

31
00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.959
That's a brightness of your scene overall, basically your GI, kind of how that indirect

32
00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.959
lighting is bouncing around.

33
00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.280
Indirect lighting quality, try to keep that high if you can.

34
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.000
This decreases artifact noise and indirect lighting smoothness, keep this low.

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.039
This blurs indirect lighting component in your light map.

36
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.039
So again, keeping these things in mind as you work through your process.

37
00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:24.159
Now if you're unfamiliar with the baking process, maybe you're new to Unreal and you're more

38
00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.359
on the Lumen phase, let me point out where these things can be found.

39
00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.359
So in my world settings, you'll see that we have a Lightmass settings area.

40
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.159
You'll see Lightmass as the topic.

41
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.879
And from there, we would open this up.

42
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.479
We see our static lighting level scale.

43
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.799
Our scene's pretty small, so we don't have to adjust this too much.

44
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.079
There are some darker shadow areas in here that we can clean it with some lights moving

45
00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.120
nearby.

46
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.759
But some of this is caused because of the thickness that is not included in some of

47
00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:52.759
these rocks.

48
00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.200
And that can be a little bit tricky.

49
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
So the same rule that we came across when it came to Lumen, it's kind of the same process

50
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
here.

51
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.120
We want to make sure we have thick pieces of geo.

52
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.000
And you'll notice that I've extruded them in Unreal using the modeling tool.

53
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.439
There's a bit of banding.

54
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.920
And I'm not worried about the EVs on the other side.

55
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.680
It's this side where I'm more concerned.

56
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.599
Now if you don't do that, you can get these dark areas.

57
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.280
And let me show you a little bit up close.

58
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.159
So if I go in here and bring in a rec light, anytime you bring in a new light, Unreal's

59
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.439
going to give you a warning and say, buddy, you really do need to rebuild your lighting.

60
00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.959
And the two modes for your lights you're going to be in a constant, going to be in a constant

61
00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.439
positioning for is you want to make sure that you set things to either static, and that's

62
00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.240
for objects that don't move, and stationary.

63
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.719
And that can be for objects that do move in your scene.

64
00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.840
But again, both lights do not move.

65
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.759
The stationary one is a bit more complicated than the static.

66
00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.280
The static is the cheapest.

67
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.479
Stationary is the second to that.

68
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.919
And movable is the most expensive since it's dynamic.

69
00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.560
Stationary allows you to change the intensity of the light and the color and your characters

70
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.099
and moving objects to be affected by that light with the shadows updating.

71
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.719
So in this light here, we can bring this into our scene.

72
00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.000
And then we would have to go in here and make it so this light is bouncing around in our

73
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
environment.

74
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.120
And you can see we can remove some of those dark areas simply by moving things around.

75
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.120
Now again, you can increase the strength of this light, and you can remove some of that.

76
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.480
And you can also control your width and height when it comes to your scene in here.

77
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.079
And as you do, the energy will kind of be removed from the object as you increase the

78
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:37.639
size, because it is again, like a series of point lights inside of a rectangle or square,

79
00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.879
depending on what shape you choose.

80
00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.879
And it is the most expensive light, but you'll see we're removing some of those dark

81
00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.879
areas.

82
00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.759
Some of them may still persist in some regions, but that's a quick way to be able to get that

83
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.759
up and running.

84
00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.240
But again, you want to keep things low when you're working in your scene.

85
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.719
So that's one way you can fix it.

86
00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.040
And you can even bump up the saturation in some areas if it's persistent to maybe cheat

87
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.719
some of that or even correct your texturing.

88
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.159
But overall, your light map density needs to be of the same level.

89
00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.759
Well, what does that mean?

90
00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.600
So if we go to lit here and we go to optimization view modes, we want to go to our light map

91
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.760
density here.

92
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.640
And you can see it in here showing us different resolution types.

93
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.560
And you'll notice for teaching purposes, I've actually kept this one a bit high.

94
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.320
This could be definitely a lot higher.

95
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.560
I should say a bit low.

96
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.560
This could definitely be a lot higher so that they have the same resolution between the

97
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
rocks.

98
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.960
So if I went in here, I would want to change this override and make it from a 62 or excuse

99
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.640
me, a 62, a 64 and make that a bit higher.

100
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.159
You'll see the other one here.

101
00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.159
He's a 128.

102
00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.800
So we kind of probably want a 128 here too.

103
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.919
And the reason why we do that is it can prevent some of those dark regions that could occur

104
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.800
and blobby areas working with your again, your world settings for your light mass.

105
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.279
So let's go back into the light mass here.

106
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.839
And I just want to give you some quick tips there for those dark regions that may occur.

107
00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.539
Now again, indirect lighting quality, we have control here, keep these numbers low initially.

108
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.020
You can also control your overall color for your environment.

109
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.379
Now all of these changes that I've just made, including if I chose to maybe change the color

110
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.780
of everything, it's going to affect my final bake.

111
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.820
When you are baking, make sure that you set your builds to, if we go here to production.

112
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.820
Now we're in preview.

113
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.980
That means the build is going to be pretty quickly.

114
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.620
But if you want to see that actual bounce, we want to set that to production.

115
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.259
Let's go ahead and go back to the slides.

116
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.220
So you also want to take into account what kind of light you're using, like we mentioned

117
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.300
before, static versus stationary.

118
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.220
Now if you decide that you need a movable light is a move in your scene, you need to

119
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.220
make sure that mesh distance fields are active within your project settings.

120
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.540
Now again, you can use CPU light mass for final pixel, as well as ICVFX.

121
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.340
And you can also use GPU light mass if you need it.

122
00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:11.979
So keep in mind that Lumen will probably be your best bet, especially if you want updates

123
00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.419
on the fly.

124
00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.419
So keep those things in mind when you're working with Unreal.

125
00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:24.979
Now your volumetric clouds are expensive and will need adjustment for CPU baking for believability.

126
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.899
So they will not render accurately at this time with ray tracing.

127
00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.219
So if you choose that, that is still on the roadmap.

128
00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.379
So keep that in mind.

129
00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:37.139
So never forget the power of the rec light.

130
00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.579
That's one reason I showed it to you.

131
00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:40.579
It can fill those areas that you need.

132
00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:44.699
And that even goes for Lumen, as you saw me do earlier, that will fill that space and

133
00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:50.500
give and fake some of the bounce light that we may or may not be getting immediately.

134
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.259
So again, you can control on the point lights your source length and your source radius,

135
00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:02.419
as well as your overall view and feel and shape for that with those properties.

136
00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:05.879
So let me actually jump into Unreal real quick.

137
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:12.480
So if you do get a hot spot or say this, this is not highly reflective, but if it was,

138
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.719
I could go in here and soften that up using my soft source radius.

139
00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:18.719
And unfortunately, it can pixelate your shadow.

140
00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:19.719
So just be aware of that.

141
00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:21.519
I just want to mention that too.

142
00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:26.560
Remember also too, when it comes to light mass, make sure you use area shadows for stationary

143
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
light.

144
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.360
So if this is a stationary light and I keep it like this, say I want to use it to maybe

145
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.840
fill out some bounce light in here, I would again turn that on and then I would make a

146
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.720
fresh build bake in this environment.

147
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.320
So here are some pro tips when it comes to using CPU baking.

148
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.000
Try to make sure your geo is solid.

149
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.279
Now this is a golden rule working with Unreal as well as Lumen.

150
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:56.519
Having hollowed out pieces of geometry can be tricky.

151
00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:59.180
So when intersected, it makes sense to Unreal.

152
00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:04.859
Now you will see some times where you might see that rule broken.

153
00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:07.739
There's like a cafe that I use every once in a while.

154
00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:09.739
There's a thin floor.

155
00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:11.539
There's thin walls.

156
00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:12.939
It's really made for baking.

157
00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:14.539
And it works okay.

158
00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:16.259
It's not too bad.

159
00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:18.539
And there really isn't much light leaking.

160
00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:22.959
But as soon as I switch to Lumen, that's where things might be a little weird in some areas

161
00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:28.620
and some corners of it because the mesh distance field isn't quite calculated incorrectly, especially

162
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.259
if I step out of that area or I rotate in such a way that those little thin areas are

163
00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:38.539
revealed in some way, the mesh distance field gets a bit confused.

164
00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:42.340
You want to keep your light map resolution for intersecting geo, which I mentioned before,

165
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.700
the same or at least in the same ballpark.

166
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.460
This will prevent any blobby shadows on the seams, any weird light leaking that might be

167
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.460
happening.

168
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.659
Can't seem to say leaking before the leaking, leaking.

169
00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.299
I don't know what's happening.

170
00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.659
Or in tears, you can use light mass portals, but can be expensive.

171
00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.500
So use them deterministically.

172
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:07.859
Now, light mass portals that you heard me mention earlier and other classes, light mass portals

173
00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:12.259
do not work with GPU light mass.

174
00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:15.219
They only work with CPU.

175
00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:17.299
For some reason, do not calculate correctly.

176
00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:22.620
And they're basically put in front of opening of a cave or a window versus interior and

177
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.620
an exterior.

178
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.899
You're right for that cusp in that area where the values change, and that's what you would

179
00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:29.139
use it for.

180
00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:33.299
Rec lights were great for interiors as fill lights, but can be expensive.

181
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:37.139
And again, they are point lights over that surface, like a series of point lights.

182
00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:41.220
So indirect lighting quality can be increased, but can be expensive with build times.

183
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.379
Keep that in mind.

184
00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:45.139
Default maybe fine and turn off compressed light maps.

185
00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:53.019
So you can do that again, inside of your world settings for light mass, and you can turn

186
00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.939
that compress off right there.

187
00:10:56.939 --> 00:11:00.460
Make sure the stationary lights are set to use area shadows, like I mentioned before

188
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.460
also.

189
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.059
So don't forget that.

190
00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:09.659
Outside of ICV effects, though, you can show to your director different lighting scenarios.

191
00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:17.379
Now you can use that level snapshot, but if you have a lot of static lights, it doesn't

192
00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:19.659
really work really cleanly.

193
00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:26.339
You can cheat a little bit and use a thing called a streaming level node.

194
00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:29.899
And we can use a level blueprint, but you can only show off three at a time.

195
00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.019
So that's a bit of the limitation.

196
00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:34.899
So this is again, why lumens a little bit better.

197
00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:37.939
Let me show you a little bit of how that works in engine.

198
00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:40.299
And you can get an idea of what I'm talking about.

199
00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.379
So in Unreal, I'm going to go to our class folder.

200
00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:44.139
I'm going to go to maps.

201
00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.620
And I'm going to go into here and click on base.

202
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.899
Now it's going to ask you to save.

203
00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:49.340
I'm really not saving anything.

204
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.980
I'm going to click on base here.

205
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.419
I'm going to say, don't save.

206
00:11:53.419 --> 00:12:00.659
Now when I open up this base file, you're going to notice that there's really not much

207
00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:01.819
to write home about.

208
00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:05.100
It's pretty much just a dark environment.

209
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.100
So what I did, let me click on my drawer and click here, what I did was I created a level

210
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.779
blueprint in here.

211
00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.379
So let's go and open this up.

212
00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.860
Let's open up our level blueprint.

213
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.179
And in this level blueprint, I loaded other scenes that I already baked out the lights.

214
00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:25.100
I created a thing called a multigate.

215
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.980
You can also use a sequence if you wanted to.

216
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.379
That one works just fine.

217
00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:32.500
So that's up to you.

218
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.419
If you want to use that, you can see sequence here.

219
00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:36.899
Kind of works about the same way.

220
00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:40.659
I just basically use the multigate, which is used for weapon swapping.

221
00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.139
So I built this guy in here.

222
00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:49.819
I had a hotkey to start it out, created a level switch here, Boolean, put it into the loop,

223
00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:53.500
and I used a current level here, which is an integer.

224
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.220
And I put it into the start index so it actually knows my intentions.

225
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.899
From there, I created a unload stream level and a load stream level.

226
00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:07.259
I started out with one of my choice, which is like the day one that I baked out daylighting.

227
00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:08.259
And I cycled it through.

228
00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:09.259
There's a night one.

229
00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:10.259
You load it.

230
00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:11.259
You unload it.

231
00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.379
You unload it.

232
00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:13.379
It's really that easy.

233
00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:14.899
Load it, unload it.

234
00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:19.100
And then make sure that you compile once you get everything in there that you need.

235
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.860
I do want to point out, though, as you click on this, you want to make sure you have make

236
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.899
visible after load, make visible after load, and make visible after load for all of the

237
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:35.939
load streaming little nodes that we have here, little sets that we have.

238
00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:39.620
So in my multigate, you notice it's pretty simple.

239
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.819
Level switch here.

240
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.940
You make sure you turn on level switch.

241
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.260
Click on that little node there.

242
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.860
And we have current level.

243
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.260
You'll notice that's just set by default, but we are using an integer setting that to

244
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.260
that.

245
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.740
And then now you got to make sure you get the names right.

246
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.740
That's really super important.

247
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.740
So once you get the names right, we can now go in here in our scene.

248
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.580
And if I hit play, now, again, this is why it's not really used for ICVFX because you

249
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.780
can't do this with a switchboard setup and so forth.

250
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.580
But if you're doing virtual production, this actually works pretty well.

251
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:16.700
I can hit play and click in the environment and hit X. And I can load, hey, there's my

252
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.500
kind of nighttime area.

253
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.379
Here's my super blue, not sure just the super blue day planet of blueness.

254
00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:26.540
And then we have our daytime in here.

255
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.379
And I'm just cycling through and we can fly through the environment too.

256
00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:36.500
And we can see a comparable of these different environment lighting scenarios.

257
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.500
So you only get three.

258
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.820
Now, I have a really powerful computer.

259
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.659
It's an A6000 threadripper.

260
00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:47.139
And I am at my max limit GPU-wise, so I can't do a fourth.

261
00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:48.620
So just keep that in mind.

262
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.580
Let's go back to the slides.

263
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.259
So if you're interested, I'll walk you through each one of these.

264
00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:59.059
Again, I do recommend level snapshot using Lumen, but this is another one that you can

265
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:00.059
use.

266
00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:04.059
If you were to use level snapshot, make sure that you have primarily stationary lights

267
00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:05.980
in your environment.

268
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.740
Lighting between bakes can be a little bit clunky for static lighting, but stationary

269
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.580
light seems to work OK with level snapshot.

270
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.180
But mostly you want to use that for Lumen.

271
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:21.860
And again, each step is walking you through how these work.

272
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.860
That's it for this video.

273
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.980
In the next video, we're going to take a look at GPU light mass in detail and how that works.

274
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.460
Thanks again.

275
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.980
Thank you.
