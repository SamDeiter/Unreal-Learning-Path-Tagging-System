00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to take a look at the Lumen equation.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.400
We'll look at key workflows, limitations, and quality control.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.240
So let's get started.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.839
So Lumen fully supports ICVFX currently.

5
00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.240
There can be some noise that occurs, so just be aware of it in your materials.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.900
You can do some adjusting as well as controlling some of the quality there, but the noise may

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.480
still persist in particular areas.

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.960
So just keep in mind that Lumen is getting better and stronger with each new version.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.679
It's good for Final Pixel and ICVFX, so feel free to play with those and experiment with

10
00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:40.679
them.

11
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.539
It is quick and easy to use and updates on the fly.

12
00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.079
It does not currently support caustics, that is what Path Tracer is for.

13
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.799
So make sure if you do need it, you can fake a few things with decals, which we've talked

14
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.759
about in previous material classes, but for the most part, if you want that actual mathematical

15
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.439
accuracy, you'll have to go into Path Tracer to do so.

16
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.560
Again, like I said, it updates on the fly and Lumen is evolving.

17
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.759
It's getting better, faster, stronger with each new version.

18
00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.039
Now Lumen uses software ray tracing.

19
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.039
So some limitations can come with this, so keep this in mind.

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.360
So software ray tracing requires that levels be composed of modular geometry.

21
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.400
So you need to make things pretty much like Legos.

22
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.640
You need to build a wall, you need to build floors, and you need to make sure that they

23
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
have some sort of thickness to them.

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.000
If they don't have any thickness to them, you can run into problems.

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.360
The distance fields cannot represent extremely thin features or one-sided meshes seen from

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
behind.

27
00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.879
So you make sure that you strategically position your meshes accordingly when that occurs.

28
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:56.359
So keep that in mind because you can hit some light leaking if you're not careful.

29
00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:02.079
So something to keep in mind there when working with Lumen.

30
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.199
So you can extrude them ahead of time in a DCC, then bring them in, or you can do them

31
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.319
also in Unreal where you extrude them using the modeling tools.

32
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.400
Just be aware that some UV navigation and editing will be needed at that point.

33
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.519
So this has improved avoiding the light leaking in Unreal 5.3, and it's getting better stronger

34
00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.519
faster.

35
00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.280
But sometimes you just can't avoid the open geometry, such as scans, large mega scans,

36
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.639
scanning that has been done, something that you and your company have scanned.

37
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.319
There may be some open-ended areas, but try to seal this up if you can.

38
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.519
And it just makes things a little bit easier for the mesh distance fields and Lumen to be

39
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.000
calculated correctly so we can prevent some of that light leaking that may be happening.

40
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.319
So mesh distance field resolution is assigned based on the imported scale of the static mesh.

41
00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.120
This is something you have to be careful with.

42
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.079
And I've been guilty of this when I first was introduced to Lumen, where you bring in

43
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.639
a small item and you're like, hmm, I need that thing to be twice, three times, four times

44
00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.560
bigger than its actual size.

45
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.680
And it mainly happens when you have a dramatic, like two times and maybe not so much, but

46
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.920
something that you need to, that's really small and you make it a lot bigger.

47
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.800
Once you've already imported into the scene, you can run into some weird build errors with

48
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.319
your mesh distance field.

49
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.360
So just keep that in mind.

50
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.159
The resolution on that's going to be a little bit odd.

51
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.199
So you make sure you do those ahead of time before you bring them in and decide to change

52
00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.960
their original size that came in.

53
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.200
So Lumen provides two methods of ray tracing in the scene, software ray tracing and hardware

54
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.400
ray tracing.

55
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.640
So this can be a little bit confusing for the people.

56
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.439
So what's happening here is that ray tracing is helping elite, particularly with the software

57
00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.240
ray tracing.

58
00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.920
It uses mesh distance fields to operate on the widest range of the hardware and performs

59
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.600
and platforms, but is limited to the types of geometry materials workflows it can effectively

60
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
use.

61
00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.359
So there are some limitations there and that's where the hardware ray tracing leaning on

62
00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.280
that is going to be very supportive.

63
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.920
It supports a larger range of geometry types for higher quality by tracing against the

64
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.120
triangles and to evaluate lighting.

65
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.639
This is where you can see the Nanite feature comes into play and helps greatly with this

66
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.639
process.

67
00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.879
So we got virtual shadow maps and Nanite and Lumen.

68
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.439
I call them the three musketeers and they all help you to have a nice and beautiful

69
00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.719
scene with the highest visual fidelity possible with the best performance.

70
00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:46.000
So to evaluate the lighting, this is actually pretty helpful in here where ray tracing is

71
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.639
concerned and allows you to actually get some really great stuff instead of a lower quality.

72
00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.040
Now the surface catch is an option where you can do a higher type of catch on your output

73
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.240
for your objects.

74
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.720
We'll talk about that in the quality control settings here.

75
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.960
It requires supported video cards and systems to operate those.

76
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.439
You got to make sure you have a good system under the hood that allows you to have some

77
00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.960
really great GPU processes to be able to lean on when you're using Lumen.

78
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.240
So again, software ray tracing is the only performant option in scenes with many overlapping

79
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.240
instances.

80
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:37.000
It does help while hardware ray tracing is the only way to achieve high quality mirror

81
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.840
reflections on a surface.

82
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.879
So both give you a bit of the best of the world in Lumen and allow you to have some

83
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.000
good performance going on and quality visuals.

84
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.199
But remember, there may be some noise that still persists and you'll have to do some

85
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.000
editing in there if that occurs.

86
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.040
So Lumen is not compatible with forward shading, but why would you even try this?

87
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.920
Because it does work great out of the box.

88
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.240
You can also use forward shading on that topic.

89
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.360
Was used quite often for VR, but now you can use Lumen for VR, which is pretty fantastic.

90
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.519
So transparent materials aren't ignored by distance fields and mass materials are treated

91
00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.519
as opaque.

92
00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.600
So just be aware of that.

93
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.319
There's a cafe scene that I show in one of my cinematic lighting courses and you can

94
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.800
definitely see that effect where there's a blurred shader, spiral blurred shader in

95
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.199
a node in the material.

96
00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.240
And you can see that there's a bit of noise coming in and it doesn't quite know how to

97
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.600
handle that because it's only on part of the material here and addressed and used on a

98
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.480
particular area of the object, like a texture, like a mask.

99
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.719
So it's mass materials can cause significant overshadowing on foliage too.

100
00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.920
So be aware of that too, where large areas of leaves are masked out.

101
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.160
So just be aware and test it out visually.

102
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.280
If you're getting noise, if it doesn't quite look quite right, go in there and do some

103
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.319
editing after the fact.

104
00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.040
Distance fields are built off of the properties of the material assigned to the static mass

105
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.319
asset rather than the override component.

106
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.639
So just be aware of this, overriding with a material that has a different blend mode

107
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:24.200
or that has two-sided property enabled will cause a mismatch between the triangle representation

108
00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.920
and the mesh's distance field representation.

109
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.039
So just be aware of this.

110
00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.240
That blend mode and two-sided might give you a little bit of issue.

111
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.360
I haven't come across a lot of problems with the two-sided mode being on, on an object.

112
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.959
But then again, you always have to be very deterministic when looking at your foliage

113
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.659
in small areas.

114
00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:49.240
Where there can be an issue though is where you have a bright cloud and you have a foliage

115
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.120
object in front of it and that cloud is giving off a little bit of say, emissive and it has

116
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.560
glowing properties.

117
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.400
What happens is that's when you're going to see this two-sided foliage blended mode and

118
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.879
masked issues occur, there may be some flickering with that foliage that's in front of that particular

119
00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.879
object.

120
00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:11.879
So what do you have to do at that point is be very strategic moving things around.

121
00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:15.879
We go over that in world building for virtual production, but I wanted to make mention of

122
00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.879
that.

123
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.759
So keep that in mind.

124
00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:22.639
So let's go and take a look at some of the quality settings in here in Unreal.

125
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:28.039
Again, as you increase these numbers, your GPU, it can be expensive for your GPU.

126
00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:31.279
So you try to start low and then go high.

127
00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:36.600
Now they can, we do go over this in our foundational lighting courses, but I want to walk you through

128
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.120
this before we get on to the next topic.

129
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.080
So let's go and jump into Unreal for a bit.

130
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.220
So in Unreal, in our scene, let's go ahead and get our post-process volume.

131
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.139
In my post-process volume here, I'm going to scroll down a bit here, close a few things

132
00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.139
we don't need open.

133
00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:55.379
We'll see that we're in Lumen and we have Lumen global illumination.

134
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:58.660
We do want to make sure a few things are turned off, which we'll talk about later, to make

135
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.620
sure that we have the best possible performance here.

136
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.660
Now if I increase my light, you'll notice there isn't a whole lot of light bouncing around

137
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.899
in this area here, but if I increase my light, you will see actually your GI get a little

138
00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:14.540
bit stronger, but you have to take an account how bright you want your scene to be.

139
00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:19.939
Now that's when you would bring in something such as a simple light such as a rec light,

140
00:09:19.939 --> 00:09:22.500
so you want to maybe fake some bouncing going on.

141
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.899
So I can simply just bring this in here, move it up out of the way, increase its size a

142
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.699
bit if I wanted to.

143
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:37.019
So with its size increased, I can now fake that bouncing that is going on by increasing

144
00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:42.339
also the amount of light I have and maybe even change it to be a little more yellow.

145
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.899
So we're faking that sand, giving me some feedback.

146
00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:49.700
So that's one way you can cheat if you need to, if you don't want to increase your overall

147
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.700
lighting, just a quick pro tip there and no one is the wiser.

148
00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.780
So let's go ahead and delete that for a second here.

149
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.540
And let's go ahead and take a look at that post process volume.

150
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.220
So in this post process volume, you'll see that our global illumination is Lumen.

151
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.779
So we have our scene Lumen scene lighting quality set up to two.

152
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:17.340
Now if you want to, you can say, hey man, I'm going to go maybe three, you can do that.

153
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.920
Two works pretty well, but you can go a bit higher.

154
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.899
This overall quality here, you'll see scales Lumen scenes quality, but larger scales cause

155
00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:32.779
Lumen scene to be calculated with a higher fidelity, which can be a visible in reflections

156
00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:34.460
but increased if you cost.

157
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.899
So you're going to see some better reflections as you increase this number, but it's going

158
00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:38.899
to cost your GPU.

159
00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:41.939
Now we definitely want to increase our Lumen scene detail.

160
00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:43.139
So let's go and increase that here.

161
00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:44.939
We're going to keep that at four.

162
00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:50.299
And again, this one sure smaller objects are represented, so, but again, it does cost some

163
00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.779
GPU memory.

164
00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:58.019
We have Lumen scene view distance so we can increase the influence of our Lumen accuracy

165
00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:00.299
in our whole environment between that out.

166
00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:02.659
We definitely want to increase our final gather quality.

167
00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:05.059
This is going to remove some noise that's in our scene.

168
00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:07.100
And we also have max trace distance.

169
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.940
Again, I leave that at default, but you can go ahead and it will increase the area that

170
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.180
you're tracing against for your scene.

171
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.820
The values too small will cause lighting to leak into large caves.

172
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.860
So yeah, we got a cave here and we don't want that.

173
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.019
So we want to keep this at the default and we can go maybe a little bit higher if we

174
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.019
needed.

175
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:33.460
So and we also have seen catcher catch our resolution scale here.

176
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:40.379
So again, this is helps with our overall look and feel smaller values save GPU memory

177
00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:42.740
at a cost and quality.

178
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.820
So this is going to give us our Lumen surface resolution control here.

179
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.980
Down below we have the advanced settings we can open up here.

180
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.019
Now this is going to give us a refresh that we need speedily and we want to increase this

181
00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.180
if we can.

182
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.379
Now this all depends on your GPU.

183
00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:06.100
There's a cheap type of you know, you can think of it as a saturation boost here, diffuse

184
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.500
boost here if you wanted to, you can increase that if you wanted to in your scene.

185
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.139
Now we don't really need to do that, but we can say I want to do five, you'll see you

186
00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:16.259
get a little brighter.

187
00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:19.740
But this can actually maybe help in some areas when you want to get a little bit more of a

188
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.820
bounce.

189
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.659
Watch the sand here as they go increase decrease that number.

190
00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:28.700
So it's at four right now, but I can go and switch that back to one.

191
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.700
You'll see that get darker.

192
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.820
I could even go as high as 10 if I wanted to.

193
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.580
But again, that just gives you kind of a fake type of setting there and you'll see it if

194
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.580
you're not careful.

195
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.220
It can pulse a little bit.

196
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.660
So just keep that in mind.

197
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.220
I like to keep that just as a default one and that works just fine.

198
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.620
You can even keep that at a zero if you wanted to.

199
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.620
They have no reaction whatsoever.

200
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.259
Well, I forget that zero doesn't really take it does take a one.

201
00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:54.780
My bad for that.

202
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.060
And it will not go.

203
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.180
It refuse.

204
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180
It resists.

205
00:12:58.179 --> 00:12:59.739
It will not go any lower.

206
00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:01.239
Makes sense.

207
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:05.139
This tells you that it's always active and available and then you can change it from

208
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:06.139
there.

209
00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:08.939
So we have skylight leaking here.

210
00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:15.059
Now in ray tracing before used to have to evaluate your skylight and so forth and make

211
00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:17.500
sure that it's working because you would get dark areas.

212
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.699
This allows you to control that type of feature here.

213
00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:22.699
So we have skylight leaking and you'll see Unreal helps you out here.

214
00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:26.979
This allows for your interiors, your indoors not to go fully black and allows you to control

215
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
that if you need to.

216
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.460
Mine's a little bit dark.

217
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.420
So if I wanted to, I could increase this like maybe two, but you'll notice it brightens

218
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.860
my sand a little too much.

219
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.740
It doesn't quite give me the bounce.

220
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.340
It's really dark over here on this particular object.

221
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:49.100
So what I can do is just let's move that back down to its default zero and I can put that

222
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.100
light in there.

223
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.500
That's one reason I brought that up in the beginning and just bounce it in here artificially.

224
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.179
Now also you want to make sure that you're using nanite.

225
00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:01.340
So if I'm not using nanite, I want to find that piece of geometry right click in here

226
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.620
and make sure that nanite is active.

227
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:08.899
This is going to work a bit better in using our virtual shadow maps.

228
00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:12.980
Again does get a little bit dark in some areas, but you'll notice as I move my light around,

229
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.299
everything's being calculated accurately.

230
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:20.500
It's just that my light isn't very bright and it isn't very high in the sky.

231
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.299
So if I wanted to, I can increase my light even more and you'll actually see the light

232
00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.220
bounce in areas that you want.

233
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.659
This is really up to you as you're working through this, but I'm always using fill lights

234
00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:32.659
as much as possible.

235
00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:34.620
And again, that's why I mentioned that earlier.

236
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.860
We can use a fill light to get our light to bounce around like we need and those darker

237
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.419
areas won't be so persistent.

238
00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:47.299
So if we go back to our post-process volume here, let's go back down.

239
00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:51.579
You'll notice we also have the full light leaking distance.

240
00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:54.979
You can actually control that too distance wise if you need.

241
00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:59.740
So just basically how much of that is going to be influencing our Lumen environment.

242
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:06.059
Down below we have our Lumen Reflections Quality Control Ray Lighting mode.

243
00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.219
Notice mine's set to hit.

244
00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:10.500
We have some water we want to have nicely represented.

245
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.740
So you want to make sure that that set had a good amount.

246
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.899
So let me actually move my light back down again.

247
00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:20.899
So we're not having completely blown out scene.

248
00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:25.980
And if I want to, I can just lower my lighting just a little bit there, move it around and

249
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.180
maybe move it higher into the sky here.

250
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.419
We get like an overcast today in the Caribbean.

251
00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:34.820
So you can actually get some really cool effects here.

252
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.820
Cool.

253
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.820
All right.

254
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.740
So back to my post-process volume again.

255
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.299
It's going down a little bit.

256
00:15:41.299 --> 00:15:48.779
You'll see again we have high quality translucency reflections here, which we need for our water.

257
00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:50.179
Can't talk today.

258
00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:51.179
For sure.

259
00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:53.259
And then we have max reflection bounces.

260
00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:55.740
We have set these to three.

261
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.939
We're kind of far away from the water and we're getting probably a little bit of noise

262
00:15:58.939 --> 00:15:59.939
there.

263
00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:01.459
So I'm not too worried about that so much.

264
00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:05.219
What we can do is just edit that material if we needed to a little bit more and get

265
00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:07.299
things into a better position here.

266
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:10.620
Now again, noise will persist a little bit in some areas.

267
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.740
And notice we have a glowing environment here for our fog.

268
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.819
And in that we have some thin areas, which are getting a little bit of noise.

269
00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:24.419
So again, if you want to, you can actually reposition or make your clouds a little bit

270
00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:27.899
lighter if you needed to and even dumb down your fog.

271
00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:33.620
Now in this particular case, our fogs, exponential height fog, if we scroll up, let's go back

272
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.620
up here for a second.

273
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.419
Notice we're not using volumetric.

274
00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.539
So if I turn on volumetrics and I decided to maybe just tone them down a little bit,

275
00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:45.539
you can get maybe slightly less amounts of that going on.

276
00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:49.139
But you'll notice it does flicker a little bit with the trees and these thin areas.

277
00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:54.379
What I would want to do is go and maybe make my clouds a little bit less persistent with

278
00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:56.979
their positioning and move things around.

279
00:16:56.979 --> 00:17:02.259
And you can do that choosing whatever cloud system that you want to use.

280
00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:04.059
Now you'll see a volumetric cloud.

281
00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:08.139
Notice our material and then we can just go into the material and maybe just play with

282
00:17:08.139 --> 00:17:10.899
some of the parameters in here.

283
00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.339
That's it with this one.

284
00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.940
In the next video, we're going to take a look at some key points in Lumen and some other

285
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.139
details to get the best inner editing when it comes to using it.

286
00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:20.700
Thanks again.
