00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go over the outline for this series of videos

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.320
as well as look at some optimization lighting concepts.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.679
So let's get started.

4
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.760
So the outline for the scores, first up we'll be looking at lighting optimization.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.359
We'll be analyzing scenes and priority areas as that's very important when it comes to

6
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.359
lighting.

7
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.400
We'll look at baking versus dynamic as a quick overview and then we're going to jump right

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
in.

9
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.239
So in Lumen we'll look at the Lumen equation overall as in key workflows, limitations,

10
00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.439
quality control, optimizing and editing.

11
00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.320
Next we'll look at a review of light mass baking.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.399
This includes CPU and GPU workflows.

13
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000
We'll look at light mass baking CPU review.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.719
We'll set up how to set up a pre-computed lighting scenario review and GPU light mass

15
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.480
review.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.159
Next we'll look at screen space global illumination.

17
00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.439
How to use it, when to use it and how to add some things.

18
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.759
Then we'll look at ray tracing as an overall review which will include optimizing for final

19
00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.519
pixel review and optimizing for ICV effects to workflows.

20
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.840
And finally last but not least we'll look at optimizing for fog effects.

21
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.799
We get that request a lot.

22
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.879
What to look for and optimizing settings.

23
00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.560
With that in mind let's go ahead and get started.

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.879
So review, lighting optimization.

25
00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:29.759
Now this is covered in some of the foundational lighting courses but we will be pointing out

26
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.599
a few things specifically for ICV effects and linear workflows.

27
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:39.439
With some mentions to games because there are some very fundamental principles for both

28
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.199
of these that need to be considered when working with lighting.

29
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:45.759
So let's go ahead and get started.

30
00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.840
So analyzing scenes and priority areas.

31
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.959
The approach.

32
00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.599
You need to determine up front if you're using lumen versus ray tracing versus baked lighting.

33
00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.359
This is really important because with each type of lighting comes some things you need

34
00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.639
to consider.

35
00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.399
This can be determined if final pixel is your goal or ICV effects.

36
00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.400
Even games also depend on the strength of the machine's running.

37
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.240
And you also need to consider where you're sending your information to.

38
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.439
So are you going to be in the case of games are you packaging it out for mobile or for

39
00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.599
iPads.

40
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.159
Are you in the case of ICV effects on a large wall with high performance machines that you're

41
00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:35.039
sending to the via switchboard or are you working with a lower end scene or output and

42
00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.039
final pixel.

43
00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.360
What kind of GPO are you running when you decide to do and work with your machines.

44
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.560
What is the best approach with those restrictions in mind.

45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.280
So no lumen is currently available for ICV effects but takes some material and noise overhead.

46
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.640
So you need to consider those things.

47
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.960
Ray tracing is not effective for ICV effects.

48
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.759
But for virtual production you can use it or in the case of final pixel.

49
00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.879
If used in games materials are a big part of the performance when it comes to ray tracing

50
00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.640
as well as small numerous geo and enclosed areas.

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.680
So analyzing the scenes and priority areas.

52
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.000
So your priorities are really important when it comes to ICV effects and virtual production.

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.920
You need to make sure that what's important what's up front needs to have the best visual

54
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.319
fidelity and have the highest polys.

55
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.680
So that's kind of the same principle when it comes to games.

56
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.520
So if you're not worried when it comes to final pixel if you're not worried about frame

57
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.040
rate typically.

58
00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:44.000
So ray tracing path tracer or lumen can be used or even a bake method with a combination

59
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.639
of ray tracing at the same time if you wish.

60
00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.680
Out of the box unreal legacy baking does a great job.

61
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.639
So ray tracing or lumen may not always be needed.

62
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.079
So just just depends what your visual and you need or want.

63
00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.719
The reason why I say that is because each one has a caveat.

64
00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.919
If we went to baking our reflections aren't going to be accurate.

65
00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.000
If we go to lumen we may find some noise that is persistent a little bit tricky to deal with.

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.079
I say the effects lumen in this case is the best approach for instant results and output

67
00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.599
when it comes to putting stuff to your wall.

68
00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.120
But again you need to consider your materials and you need to consider what you can do to

69
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.560
maybe hide some of that noise that is occurring.

70
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.879
Others will pre bake or use GPU light mass and that also is an option for ICV effects.

71
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:36.519
GPU baking makes things be a little bit faster if you have to update things on the fly on

72
00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:39.319
set versus CPU baking.

73
00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.560
Now we'll talk about the difference between those and it's a bit of review if you've taken

74
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.000
some of the lighting classes but we're definitely going to look at some of those caveats.

75
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.639
So keep those things in mind when you are tackling your scenes.

76
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.480
ICV effects approach having a good idea of the visual concepts ahead of time is key.

77
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.319
A lot of people I find out working with clients and helping people out working in this workflow

78
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.000
trying to get ICV effects or understand the concept of it in the context of Unreal.

79
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.640
A lot of people will still think of Reels like an offline render and throw everything

80
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.520
at it including the kitchen sink.

81
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.160
But it doesn't work like that.

82
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.319
You have to actually work within a real time within real time restrictions.

83
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.319
So again priority areas are key.

84
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.319
Everything in the background can even be put on cards.

85
00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.240
So you can make an alpha that's clean and believable maybe even hide some of its impurities with

86
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.759
fog cards or actual fog and you can actually come up with a really nice scene but you got

87
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.360
to be very strategic when you do so.

88
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.959
One thing people need to consider if they are looking at ray tracing it is not path tracing.

89
00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:53.839
In a real time scenario ray tracing is expensive.

90
00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.919
Lumion is the best approach for your LED volumes.

91
00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.799
So keep those things in mind.

92
00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:05.679
So here's a couple comparisons here of how things are a bit more streamlined and work

93
00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:08.919
better when it comes to lumen versus baking.

94
00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.959
For ICV effects the dynamic lighting because all your lights are removable with lumen is

95
00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.919
ideal and optimized in 5.3 using level snapshots.

96
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.719
We'll talk a little bit about level snapshots.

97
00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.879
We do have classes for that so we're not going to get too deep into it.

98
00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:27.920
They can be used for baking scenarios but they were primarily focused on or can update

99
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.560
correctly better with stationary lights.

100
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.639
Now when you introduce static lighting and you're trying to use level snapshots that's

101
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.959
a little trickier because that bake information doesn't always slide across between each level

102
00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:46.120
snapshot that you made smoothly so it's better to use lumen if you can.

103
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.079
For baking using a blueprint level streaming is an option which we'll briefly talk about

104
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.639
for pre-computed lighting scenarios.

105
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.199
Baked.

106
00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.680
That is better to be considered because Unreal can easily snap between them but there is

107
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.919
a limitation where you only get about 3 otherwise you'll hit a GPU cap.

108
00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.240
So final pixel approach.

109
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.959
Baking or ray tracing as well as lumen can be used depending on the need.

110
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.919
Ray tracing many times will be used due to the fact that frame rate performance is not

111
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.680
a concern when it comes to final pixel.

112
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.759
So keep that in mind so if you just need a good final product you can turn down by using

113
00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:34.080
it in scaling turn down a bunch of effects and looks and feel and get the raw data you

114
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.040
need then turn it on before you go to your final render and that can actually work pretty

115
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.680
well.

116
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.639
You'll see down below there's a lot of great things you can produce using baked lighting.

117
00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.000
All three of these are all baked lighting.

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.680
This is the Australian outback sample that we had a while back.

119
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.319
This is the rebirth demo that was done by Quixel before we acquired them and all of them are

120
00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.399
all baking.

121
00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.279
No ray tracing is involved.

122
00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:06.560
No lumen is involved for it hasn't come around yet and it's straight up baking.

123
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.800
Here's a link if you want to dive in more into these topics and get a better idea about

124
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
optimizing.

125
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.040
In the next section we're going to take a look at the lumen equation and have a deep dive

126
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.360
into how to optimize and use lumen to the best of its ability.

127
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.840
Thanks again.
