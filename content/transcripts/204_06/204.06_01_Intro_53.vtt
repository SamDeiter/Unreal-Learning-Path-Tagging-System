Hi everyone, my name is Sean Spitzer, Senior Instructor for Epic Games.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.279
Today we're going to be talking about optimization for linear content, lighting and effects.

3
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.939
Some of the topics we'll be covering is lighting, optimization, analyzing scene and priority

4
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.719
areas, baking versus dynamic and overview.

5
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:25.280
We'll also take a look at Lumen and how to handle the key workflows, limitations, quality

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.760
control and optimizing and editing.

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.000
After then, we'll take a look at Lightmass Baking, CPU and GPU as a review as a whole

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.880
and we'll look at Lightmass Baking CPU as well as looking at setting up pre-computed

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.200
lighting scenarios and GPU Lightmass review.

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.840
Then we'll look at using Screen Space Global Lumenation, using some of the final pixel

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.799
workflows for that as well as ICVFX.

12
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.880
We'll look at ray tracing, optimizing for final pixel and ICVFX workflows and finally

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.400
we'll look at optimizing fog effects, what to look for and how to tackle those scenarios.

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.920
That's it for this one.

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.439
Hopefully you'll enjoy this course and have a great time.
