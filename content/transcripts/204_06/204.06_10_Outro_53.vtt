Hi everyone, so let's go ahead and recap some of the things that we talked about in this

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.320
course. We talked about lighting optimization, analyzing scenes and priority areas, baking

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.240
versus dynamic overview. We also looked at Lumen overall, the equation of what to tackle

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.800
and how to get things done using key workflows, limitations, quality control, optimizing and

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.719
editing. We also did a review of Lightmass Baking, CPU and GPU, looking at Lightmass

6
00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:37.320
Baking CPU review, overall setting up pre-computed lighting scenarios review, as well as GPU

7
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.000
Lightmass review. We also took a look at Screen Space Global Illumination, using Screen Space

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.040
for Final Pixel, and using Screen Space Global Illumination for ICBFX. We looked at some

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.200
helpful CVARS in that direction also. We also took a look at Ray Tracing Review, we looked

10
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.960
at optimizing for Final Pixel review, and optimizing for ICBFX dual workflows. And then

11
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.280
finally we looked at optimizing Fog Effects, what to look for, and optimizing settings to

12
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.400
get you in the right direction. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this series of videos and lessons,

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.120
and they will add to your project and you'll make great stuff. Thanks again and have a

14
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.480
great day.
