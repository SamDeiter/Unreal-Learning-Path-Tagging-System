  "text": " So, in your cinematics that you're creating, generally you may want to change the film back and the lens settings. So the film back, again there's many different presets here. So we can change it to IMAX, Super 8mm for example, completely up to you what kind of lens choice is and they're going to be dependent on the intention behind the scenes that you're trying to create. I'm just going to leave it at 16.9mm film for now. That gives me the desired outcome that I want and I'm going to go for say, let's go for an 85mm lens. So we can really track these characters moving through the scene with some nice depth of field. So we've got our 85mm set on our lens, we're at 16.9mm. Again if you want to change any sense of it to get more of a wider shot, completely fine. The focus settings are in here and we can drop this down. I think a quick note to make actually before I jump into focus settings, the focal length. So we've got the 85 there and you can manually override the aperture by default. This is a 1.8, so you can set 1.8 and you may, can you override this? No, so 1.8 is the minimum. You can of course change this to custom and you can override that 1.8 to say a 0.4 if you really wanted to go heavy on the aperture. So 1.8 and you can just keep lifting it if you want less depth of field. I'm going to keep it at 1.8, I like the heavy depth of field and it also allows us to look at these focus settings a little bit easier. So I'm just going to add this aperture to my favorites because that's an aperture is something that I will change quite a lot and I'll also change the lens setting there. Now focus settings, the focus by default is on manual. We can track our focus settings in a similar way to we track an actor going through the scene. We can track an actor going through the scene. So if we wanted to do this, you see that our mannequin is a little bit out of focus here and if we act to track on mannequin, you'll see that the mannequin comes into focus here. Now a good way to check our focus, draw a debug focus plane. This is something I always have on my favorites. Very easy to lose focus and think you're focusing on something when you're not and especially when you have a softer depth of field and it's not quite easy to see. The debug focus plane will definitely save you a few times there and again, if the focus will be based on the mannequin's route again, the focus will always follow the route. So if you're tracking a route and you're animating characters and they're animating off their route point, you may want to change this to manual. So just a good thing to note there about tracking focus. I don't use this setting too often. I generally prefer to do manual focus, but sometimes it's good just to have as an option just for pre-visualization maybe. So if you didn't want to track your focus and you set it as manual, by default it comes in at a very high focus. So I just generally set it to something like a hundred. It's like, okay, this is where I am focusing right now and then I'll just left mouse drag on the property and I'll just push it out and say, okay, we're kind of close here and then just manipulate it from there. So a few different things to dig into here. Again, it's worth just spending a bit of time clicking through the cameras. We'll be touching upon post-processing at the end. So I won't go into that too much, but there are basic camera properties that we can edit and change. Now let's look, go into looking at setting up an actual shot inside of Sequencer.",
