00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we have everything set up so that we can use the ocean lake and river tools,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.439
let's take a look at each one of the tools individually starting with the ocean tool.

3
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:16.240
Now to add the ocean tool to any of our projects, all we need to do is go up to the quickly

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.559
add and type in the word ocean and then click or drag the water body ocean into the map.

5
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.519
Once we do that, we're going to get something that looks similar to this.

6
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.560
So let's go over here to the editor and do this now.

7
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.919
Inside of the editor, we're going to come up here to our quickly add.

8
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.920
We're going to look for ocean and then we're going to do our water body ocean like so.

9
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.879
This insert new landscape edit layer.

10
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.239
This is telling us where do we want to put this layer in relation to our other landscape layers.

11
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.560
For us, we just have the single water, so we're going to leave it as default and hit complete.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.320
And when we do that, there we go.

13
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.200
We have got our landscape here with our water and site of it.

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400
Now, one of the things that we do need to do is move this over.

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.159
We always want to make sure that the spline that you're seeing here that represents our landscape area

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.040
is inside of the landscape actor itself.

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.760
If it goes outside of the landscape actor, you're going to see that issue that we just had.

18
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:16.960
One of the other things I like to do just to make sure that there are no issues is just zero out the X and the Y.

19
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.120
Now, we can adjust the landscape's height.

20
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
We can push it down and things like that.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.159
The other thing we can do is we can adjust these little spline points right here to adjust the look.

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.200
And feel of the landscape.

23
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:37.879
And now if we right click on one of them, we can add a spline point like so, so that we can actually kind of rough around the shape of our landscape here.

24
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.359
To look kind of similar to something that we are trying to achieve.

25
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.320
Now, there are a couple of ways that we can adjust the way that the landscape and the water intersect with one another.

26
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.799
Underneath the ocean itself, you're going to find a terrain and a water height map settings.

27
00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:04.799
Now, every single water actor that you are going to encounter are going to have these settings and they all work in a very, very similar manner.

28
00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.599
What we can do those for is first, let me just pop over here to the editor really quick.

29
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:20.199
What we can do is first we can come over here and if we go to our curve settings, the first one is adjusting how the landscape

30
00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.159
and the water intersect with one another.

31
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:31.919
So if I take this channel depth here and I put this really shallow, what this is going to do is this is going to give us a very, very shallow entry into the water,

32
00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.639
much like you would find at a beach.

33
00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:41.000
If I take this number and I increase it really, really high, it's going to make that drop off really, really, really steep, much like you would find it.

34
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.599
Maybe the ocean and the cliff and notice the waves as well.

35
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.280
The waves will actually react to the channel depth.

36
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.319
So the sharper that drop off is, the steeper the waves are going to be, the shallower that drop off, the more shallow those waves are going to be.

37
00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.039
And you can see here, it actually does kind of have a shallow waves here towards the beach.

38
00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.960
And then as it gets deeper, the waves get more and more intense.

39
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:16.240
The next area that we're going to adjust is going to be the terrain settings, which can help us give a more natural look to our our landscape just by editing a few parameters.

40
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.199
So this was actually achieved by just editing the curl noise and falloff settings.

41
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.599
So if we come back over here to the editor, let me just zoom out so we can see stuff a little bit better.

42
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.479
So the curve settings under here, under this part of the train are going to affect the water and the beach interaction.

43
00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.840
The height map settings that we have over here are going to affect this as a whole.

44
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.759
And if we come over here to effects and we do something like a curl noise and we do something like a point one, two, five, maybe we do like a little bit more here.

45
00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.159
We can get some start to get some really cool effects.

46
00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:57.959
But just be aware that the more intense the numbers that we put in here, you know, if we were to put in like something like 16, we're going to get some really, really, really crazy results.

47
00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.159
Just keep that in mind that lower numbers tend to work a little bit better here.

48
00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:13.079
Now, one of the other things that you might encounter is having the landscape water not intersecting or creating a little bit of a hole with your terrain.

49
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:31.199
And the easiest thing to do that is to either grab your landscape spline points and move them in so that the water occupies that area or just add a few more spline points by simply right clicking on them and adding a point here and then finessing that point so that the water mesh will go up against the landscape.

50
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.960
And there won't be this missing piece of water.

51
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:46.839
Now, again, this only happens when you start to really push the editing inside of the landscape in the water body ocean here and under the terrain settings, the water height map.

52
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:52.439
If we start to push the effects like our curl noise very high, that's when we're going to start to see some of these artifacting.

53
00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, there is one other thing that I want to talk about and that is the LOD.

54
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.719
Now, by default, it is going to have the LOD on.

55
00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.959
Older versions of Unreal did have this defaulting to off.

56
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:14.199
And what this level of detail actually does is it makes sure that the most active or the highest concentration of the simulation for the water is happening at the shore and closest to the camera.

57
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:20.479
And then after a certain point, it's going to go to a completely flat static mesh that is much cheaper to render.

58
00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:28.759
And in order to adjust that, if we click on our water zone down and rendering under our far distance, we're going to see this far distance mesh extent.

59
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:37.439
And this is going to allow us to push that far distance mesh really far back into the distance or bring it up closer should we want to do that.

60
00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.319
Now, again, by default, it's set to, I think, 400,000 here.

61
00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:49.959
So you're probably not going to need to adjust this, but it is something that is nice to know about in case you need to adjust it for a future project or something of that nature.
