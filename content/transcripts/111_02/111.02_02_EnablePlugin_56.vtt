00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
Before we can begin to use our water tools, we need to enable the plugin inside of our

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.820
project and restart the editor.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.740
Now to do this, all you need to do is simply go up to the plugins menu, look for the water

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.480
section and then enable water.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.339
You can enable buoyancy water actors and water advanced to see more examples of how to utilize

6
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.679
different features of the water tools.

7
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.420
Let's just pop over to the editor and look at this now.

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.460
So from our editor, we'll come up to our edit plugins and then from our plugins menu,

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
we will scroll all the way down here to the bottom and look for water.

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.859
Once we've located the water, we simply enable the plugins that we want and we'll see a

11
00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:46.620
little restart editor pop up down here or in the lower right hand corner of the editor.

12
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.020
Once we have restarted the editor, we can go up to the quickly add, type in water and we

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.200
should see something like the following which is going to show us all of the water tools

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.500
we have available.

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.740
Let's go ahead and check that now in the editor.

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.740
With the editor open, we go up to our quickly add, type in the word water and then we should

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.820
see the water body ocean, lake river, shallow water and all of the other parts of the plugin

18
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.180
that are available to us.

19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.820
Once we have established that all of this is enabled and working, we are ready to move

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.859
on to the next part which will involve setting up our world so that we can use these tools

21
00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.780
in any way, shape or form we wish.
