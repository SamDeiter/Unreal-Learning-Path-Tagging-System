00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
Now, before we can utilize the water tools in any of our levels, we need to create a

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.080
level that has a landscape actor in it.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.780
So to do this, what we're going to do is we're first going to create a basic level by coming

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.019
here to the editor, going to File, New Level, and then selecting the basic from the New

5
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.559
Level dialog.

6
00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.160
Once we have done that, we're going to go ahead and delete this static mesh here.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.800
So I'm just clicking on the floor and pressing Delete.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.080
And the next thing that we need to do is we're going to go up to our landscape and we're

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840
going to add a new landscape.

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.600
The one thing that we need to make sure that our landscape does have enabled is this Enable

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.159
Edit Layers.

12
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.120
The reason we need this is this is going to enable the option for our landscape to have

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.400
multiple layers.

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.079
And our water tools work on these layers as the water tools can directly affect the look

15
00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.840
and shape of our landscape.

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.400
So let's go ahead and set that up now.

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
So again, we're going to come up here to our selection mode and we're going to go to landscape

18
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.000
we're going to make sure we're on Create New Landscape.

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.359
We have Enable Edit Layers on by default and then we're just going to hit Create.

20
00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.159
And once we've done that, you can see here we have our landscape ready to go.

21
00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.680
So we're going to get out of landscape mode and get ready to, in the next section, explore

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.400
the different tools that make up the water tools.
