00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now that we're done with waves, let's move on to buoyancy.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.480
Now buoyancy allows objects to float on top of the surfaces,

3
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.000
but not only just that,

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.120
we can actually have buoyant objects that are say in a river,

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.679
and they can actually use that river's velocity to drag them

6
00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.519
from the river down to the ocean.

7
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.359
Now there's a couple of things that we need to do.

8
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.480
First off, we're gonna need to make sure

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300
that we use the buoyancy component

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.719
and set up something called pontoons,

11
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.759
which allow us to see where things are floating,

12
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.920
or not see where, but work as areas

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.939
where things are gonna float from.

14
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.200
So let's go ahead and set this up now.

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.519
So what I'm gonna do is hit Control Space,

16
00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.920
we're gonna right click, Blueprint Class,

17
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.479
base this off of actor,

18
00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.280
we'll just call this BP Floating Actor,

19
00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.439
and then double click on it to open it up.

20
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:54.859
Bring this over here so that we can see it.

21
00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.519
So the first thing we're gonna add is a cube.

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.520
So we're gonna add a cube right here like so.

23
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.200
We do need to add a couple of other things.

24
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.859
So we're gonna make the cube the default scene root.

25
00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:08.140
This is important because this has to happen

26
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.800
in order for buoyancy to work correctly.

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.040
Also with the cube selected,

28
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.000
we're gonna do a simulate physics,

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.320
and we're gonna set our mass KG enabled.

30
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.320
Then we're going to add a BU buoyancy component,

31
00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.520
and then next we need to add a box.

32
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.280
You want this box collision,

33
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.359
and the box collision,

34
00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.879
we're just going to pop it out once

35
00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.239
so that we can go,

36
00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.599
if we go out once like that,

37
00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.119
and then bring it back in one,

38
00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.239
we'll get a perfect box collision looking.

39
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:41.640
So if we go to our wireframe,

40
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.519
we'll see here it's exactly what we wanted.

41
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.679
And then what we need to do is select our buoyancy here,

42
00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.319
and underneath the buoyancy,

43
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.079
you're gonna see a bunch of things

44
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.039
that we want to enable or adjust.

45
00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.879
So first things first,

46
00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:55.920
we're gonna go up to pontoons.

47
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.679
We're gonna go one, two, three, and four,

48
00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.439
and we're gonna set this first one at 50 and 50,

49
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.119
and we're gonna change its radius to 50 as well.

50
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.840
And then for the next pontoon,

51
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.120
we're gonna go negative 50, negative 50,

52
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.560
and we're gonna set its radius at 50 as well.

53
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.840
So basically we're gonna be putting a pontoons on this,

54
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.079
or areas where this can float

55
00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.960
in all four corners of our box.

56
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.120
So to continue to this,

57
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.960
we're gonna go 50, negative 50,

58
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.159
and then we're gonna set this one to 50 as well.

59
00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.480
And then for this one, we're gonna go negative 50, 50,

60
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.400
and then finally 50 here.

61
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.080
So that is all we've done.

62
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000
We've just literally set all of these to 50.

63
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120
Then once we have done all of that,

64
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.960
we are gonna come here

65
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920
and we're gonna apply drag forces in water,

66
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920
and then we're gonna allow lateral push,

67
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
allow current when moving fast upstream

68
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280
and apply downstream angular rotations

69
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.760
that things will rotate,

70
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.600
because we're gonna make one

71
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
that kind of does all of our needs.

72
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.960
So let's go ahead and compile and save.

73
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.680
And once we run this,

74
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.079
what we're gonna be looking for

75
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.759
is something kind of similar to this,

76
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:05.599
where we have all of these objects out off in the distance,

77
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.359
and as we drop them in,

78
00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.840
they are gonna come from the distance

79
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.439
into the actual beach,

80
00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.439
and the same thing with our river.

81
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.079
So let's pop over here to our editor,

82
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.840
and I'm gonna close this,

83
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.079
and let's go up here and try this out right here.

84
00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.400
So we're gonna hit Control Space,

85
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280
we'll bring in our floating actor,

86
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.640
we'll put it right above this,

87
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.439
close that, and then we're just gonna hit Alt S to simulate,

88
00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.680
and let's see what happens.

89
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.400
So there we go, it's coming through,

90
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.000
it's bobbing up, all right, that's working.

91
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.560
Now you can see it is moving,

92
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.900
so it's starting to get some speed there.

93
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
And there we go, it's starting to take off,

94
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.759
it'll go down, and that's pretty cool, right?

95
00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.520
It's being pushed along with that river,

96
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
and we didn't have to do anything

97
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080
other than add our buoyancy component here.

98
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.480
So let's go ahead and we'll hit Control Space again.

99
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.360
This time though, I'm going to maybe increase this

100
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.400
to a value of five, bring it up a little bit,

101
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.600
let's just hit Alt S to see what will happen,

102
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.340
and check this out.

103
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.080
And yep, there we go, it's kind of bobbing along.

104
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.320
Now there is one command that we can use here

105
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.040
if we want to diagnose what's going on.

106
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
If we enter the command r.water.boyancydebug set to one,

107
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.640
this is going to show us the water debug.

108
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.520
So those little red things that you're seeing here,

109
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.000
those red spheres, those are our pontoons

110
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.760
that we set up before, okay?

111
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.879
So you can see them, they are covering

112
00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.640
the entire object there, and we can see them

113
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.920
kind of over here as well.

114
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.560
So this, and the green area is showing us

115
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.200
how this is simulating with the surface.

116
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.000
So we're basically running a simulation underneath

117
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.360
the surface that we are then mapping this buoyancy to,

118
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.879
and that is how we can see these waves.

119
00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.000
So if I go ahead and hit stop here,

120
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.439
and maybe I just make a couple more of these, whoa.

121
00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.879
You can see some really awesome results

122
00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.240
that we can do with this.

123
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.079
So let's just hit Alt S,

124
00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:08.560
because the last little tip that I want to leave you with

125
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.240
is this, if we, I'm just going to hit stop really quick,

126
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.639
if we come to one of these and we hit control E

127
00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.560
to open it up, and we are simulating,

128
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.759
we can actually grab our buoyancy here,

129
00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.599
and we can start to adjust some of these parameters,

130
00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.680
and we can see what the effect is going to be

131
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.480
on the buoyancy kind of in real time.

132
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.399
It gives us a better idea of what is going on

133
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.240
so that we don't necessarily have to restart

134
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.319
our simulation each time.

135
00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.319
We want to just kind of understand

136
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.639
what these values are doing

137
00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.279
and how they affect our objects.

138
00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.560
Remember, if you do want to disable, oops,

139
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.959
and I didn't want to do that,

140
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.639
what I wanted to do is hit F and then hit the Alt S again.

141
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.560
If you want to get rid of this little debug here,

142
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.759
that's, remember, we just need to come back to our console.

143
00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.039
I'm going to press up and then set that back to zero,

144
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.959
and we will get rid of that debug information,

145
00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.860
and we'll have back to this view right here.
