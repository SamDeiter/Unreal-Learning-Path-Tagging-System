00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
We're now going to take a look at adding rivers to our particular maps.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.759
Now to use the river tools, again like we did with all of the other ones, we simply search

3
00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.880
for water body river and then we click to add the river to our map.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.920
We're going to get something that looks like this.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.820
So let's go ahead and do that now.

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.320
So we're going to come in here and we are going to go river and then we're just going

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.000
to click this water body river and we have added the river to our particular map.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.719
Now with rivers, what we want to do is select our individual points here and just kind of

9
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.480
drag them along to make the river longer.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.519
If we right click on them, let me just put the river all the way across the map like

11
00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.359
this, right click, add spline points.

12
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.240
We can start to add various bends and shapes inside of the river that make it look a little

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.079
bit more like a river and a little less made inside of a computer.

14
00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.000
If we come back to our water body river instance here, let me just pull this up so we can look,

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.119
just make sure that we're on it.

16
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.519
There we go.

17
00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.280
Underneath our terrain, you can see here we have our channel depth, which again is going

18
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.039
to control the depth of the river right here.

19
00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.280
So if we want a shallow river, we can set this to something like, you know, four or seven.

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640
We'll get something that's very shallow.

21
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.959
We can adjust the ramp width, which will make the river narrow or wider.

22
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:28.559
However, there are a couple of other things that the river tool has the other tools do

23
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:29.559
not.

24
00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:33.879
And that is if we click on the individual points and look for the water, we have our

25
00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.919
depth, river width, velocity and audio intensity.

26
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:43.319
So the depth and the river width are going to be some properties that you mess with a

27
00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.280
lot, as well as the velocity.

28
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.879
Now velocity controls how fast the river moves in a given direction.

29
00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.839
So if we want the river to go one, one way, we make it positive.

30
00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.759
If we want the river to go another way, we make it negative.

31
00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.319
So let's just take a look at that right now.

32
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.399
So I'm going to come in here and I'm just select this one right here.

33
00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.679
We're going to come all the way up to the top under our selected points and then water.

34
00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.199
So depth, I can make this like 64 to make the river really, really shallow.

35
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.079
And then maybe I do this like, we'll just do the times two to make it 4096.

36
00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.740
So I make the river very, very wide there.

37
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.460
The other thing I can do is set this velocity.

38
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.700
If I set this to zero, we're going to see there is no velocity there.

39
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.340
If I set this to a negative 128, we're going to see it actually flows the other direction.

40
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.280
One of the other cool things that you can do with rivers is that we could actually have

41
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.820
a bunch of rivers all put together.

42
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.260
So let's look at how we do that now.

43
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.939
All we need to do is either duplicate this river by holding alt and not alt.

44
00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.340
I want the whole, whole river.

45
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340
There we go.

46
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.180
Holding alt and duplicating the entire river.

47
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.300
And then what I can do is I can rotate this and they will actually intersect with the

48
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.900
other river bodies.

49
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.219
So you can see here, they're both intersecting.

50
00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.379
We got one flowing one way and one flowing the other way.

51
00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.860
We can take them apart.

52
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.819
They can flow across a river and then, you know, do something like that.

53
00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.659
So we have actually two that are intersecting and then going, going across.

54
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.260
So that's some really cool, interesting stuff that we can do here.

55
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.620
And again, if we just, you know, right click, add a right click, add a spline point here,

56
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.739
we can get some really interesting looking shapes.

57
00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.659
And then much like in this image here, we have a three different rivers that are all

58
00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.459
crossing each other and going in and flowing in all together.

59
00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.019
So really, really great stuff and interesting stuff that we can do with the river tools,

60
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.100
especially considering we can add multiple rivers to them.
