00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
With buoyancy and waves now completed, that's going to bring us to the end of this video tutorial series.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we first started this video tutorial by showing you how to enable the water plugin.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Remember, once you've enabled it, you do need to restart the editor.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We then showed you how to set up a world.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Remember the water tools, no matter which one you're using, does require a landscape in order to work.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So make sure your worlds do contain that so that you can utilize those tools and your projects.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We then took a look at the ocean, lake and river tools individually and how, although they do widely different things,

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
their controls on them are actually very similar.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We then took a look at how we combined the river, lakes and ocean tools together in a single map to give us a landscape

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that's got a lake with a river that goes into the ocean.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then we finished with covering waves and buoyancy.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Remember waves can be stored to an asset to allow us to take this very complicated, but very powerful tool into an easy to use asset

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that we can share between our rivers, lakes and oceans.

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And then we also touched on buoyancy, which allows objects to float.

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Remember, we can have objects also be pushed by the streams so that they can go into the lakes

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and even into the oceans and in the oceans and lakes, they can bob up and down.

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So that is going to do it for us for this video tutorial about quickly starting with the water tools.

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
My name is Sam Dider.

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with Epic Games.

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It was my pleasure having you and I'll see you next time.
