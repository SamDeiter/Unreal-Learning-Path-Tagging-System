00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.839
Now that we have seen how all the tools work individually, let's take a look at using them

2
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.279
all together. What we're going to try to do in this part of our tutorial is take the lake,

3
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.480
river and ocean tools and set up something that looks like this, where we have a lake that leads

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.760
into a river that leads into the ocean. So this is going to be pretty easy for us to set up. So

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.839
let's go over to the editor now. So this is just a level that we have created before. Remember,

6
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.079
it's got a landscape in it. And first thing we're going to want to add here is our ocean.

7
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.719
So we're going to put in our ocean. And then what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to come over

8
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.359
here and zero out the x, y and z location of our ocean just so that we have something that looks

9
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.079
like that. Alright, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here, I'm going to look for

10
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.879
our lake. I'm going to add our water body lake. And I'm going to position our lake so that it sits on

11
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.520
top of the little bit of a surface that is created from our ocean. And then last but not least, I'm

12
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.640
going to put in a river. And then we're going to need to take this river and actually drag it down

13
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.560
and then move it over. There we go. We could move it this way. And the other thing we're going to

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.200
need to move these splines over so that they kind of intersect with our river. Whoa, that was a

15
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.439
little bit too far over. So let me hit Ctrl Z to undo that. We're going to do something like this.

16
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.200
And one of the other things that you are going to want to make sure, notice that we don't get this

17
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.000
really great transition between the river and the lake here because they're at different heights.

18
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.400
So what we want to do is we want to make sure our water body lake here is at 280. And then we're

19
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.959
going to grab our river here and we're going to say 280. And that way we have them both on the same

20
00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:54.319
the same level so that they are not giving us that really weird looking transitional piece. So

21
00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.119
here, don't forget our river is also flowing backwards. So we can change this just by going

22
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.879
negative 128. And that is going to push this going the other direction. So here again, we can do

23
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.919
negative 128. And then here right here, we can also do negative 128. And that's going to push our

24
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:21.279
river down. So let's hold Alt and just kind of drag some of these down here. And we're going to

25
00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:30.159
have to kind of make start making stuff go down a little bit. So remember nice, even nice easy, I

26
00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.239
should say ways to get down and we'll eventually make it down to the water all the way down here.

27
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.280
So we can fix some of this with some adjustments afterwards. So get the

28
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.680
water coming down here. Now one of the interesting things that we would want to do here,

29
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.640
if we grab our last point here, and we take this actually this is our last point here, we take this,

30
00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.000
we're going to set this to zero. And if we set this one to zero as well, we'll get a really nice

31
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.920
transition between what is kind of coming down the hill and what is going into the water. So

32
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.400
you know, this is just going to take a little bit of work here to kind of make things look more

33
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.240
like a river, pulling things down, pushing things back up. Maybe we add some more spline points to

34
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.879
give us a little bit more elevation to work with. And this is really how we're going to make our

35
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.680
thing look like a river. Don't forget, we can also come in here and change this to say 1024,

36
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.599
you know, make things a little bit more narrow and easier to work with. We can grab both of these

37
00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.840
ones and hit them to 1024 just to make things a little bit more narrow. And we'll select all of

38
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.840
these just by holding down control and set them all to 1024. There we go. Look at that. That just

39
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.960
gives us a lot easier, more narrow narrowly defined river to work with. So there we go. We got all

40
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.840
that. So that is coming down into the ocean right there. So that's looking pretty good. Maybe add

41
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.040
a little spline point there. Bring it down a little bit, bring this one down. You know, it's just a

42
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.680
little bit of finessing. Look, we've got a little bit going outside over here. So we might just want

43
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.879
to bring this over. Maybe we adjust the point like that and bring that over. Maybe we add a new

44
00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:28.240
spline here so we can do something like this. So and then we have the also remember that we have

45
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.560
the ability to come here and do things like we add a little bit of maybe curl noise. There we go.

46
00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.920
Mess up the rivers of values a little bit. Do the same thing for our lake here. So we're going to

47
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.319
go up and we're going to look for our our terrain here and water height map settings effects. And

48
00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:52.000
we're going to go to our curl noise. Do like a point two. There we go. We like a point one, two,

49
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.360
five. We get some interesting results here. We might want to do this for our overall water itself.

50
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.600
So we're going to go to our water body ocean. Remember, we come down here to our point two.

51
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.439
There we go. And point one, two, five. So we get some cool looking results. And that is basically

52
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.920
using them all together. So what I want everybody to do is just take a little bit of time before

53
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.000
moving on to the next portion in this tutorial and just mess around with the different settings here

54
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.480
and kind of moving things around trying to get your landscape to match the river's surface.

55
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.840
Don't be afraid to also come up here into your landscape and try and use some of the the landscape

56
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.639
tools, maybe smooth things out. You know, we can also add another layer here. So we will just do

57
00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.479
edit layers and hit select. And then we can do all types of stuff we can sculpt up, or we can sculpt

58
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.759
down. There's a lot of things that we can do here to try to finesse the landscape to make it so that

59
00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:58.479
it will fit this river a little bit better. So you know, just spend some time now trying to do that.

60
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.399
We can you know, there's just all types of really cool stuff we can do. We can run some erosion on

61
00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:07.599
these hills and give them like a really cool looking weathered look. So again, a lot of stuff that we

62
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.160
can do here to get us to have something that's similar to this. So again, spend the next five to

63
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.600
10 minutes just messing around with the various settings and seeing what you can create and seeing

64
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.760
how simple it is to use these tools to make something that can fit whatever your needs are for rivers,

65
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.439
lakes or oceans.
