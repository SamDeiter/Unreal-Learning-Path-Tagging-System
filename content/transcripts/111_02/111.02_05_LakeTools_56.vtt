00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
Now that we have created our ocean tool, let's take a look at creating our lake tool.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.519
Now to add our lake, we do exactly what we did before.

3
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.919
We go up to our quickly add, we search for lake, and then we click and drag and drop it,

4
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.039
and we're going to get something that looks kind of like this.

5
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.719
Not exactly, but let's pop over to the editor and have a look now.

6
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.039
So again, quickly add, we're going to type in the word lake, and then we're going to

7
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.920
add our water body lake, and there we go.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.320
We've got our water body lake added right to our particular map.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.240
Now same with the ocean, we can click on the individual points here and adjust them.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240
We can also right click and add spline points.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.359
If we come to our water body here and we go down to our curve settings here, we can adjust

12
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.880
the channel depth.

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.100
Remember this is going to act as the basically deepest point in our lake, and then we can

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.359
adjust the curve ramp width here.

15
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.519
This is going to affect the fall off.

16
00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.240
And then underneath our water height map settings, we can do affect our fall off settings

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.880
here by affecting how the lake is going to go from the existing terrain down into the

18
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.200
lake itself.

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
We can also do all types of cool effects.

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We can blur.

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.280
We can also add a little bit of curl noise.

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.840
Maybe one was a little bit too much, but we could do something like that.

23
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
There we go.

24
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.120
Point five gives us some kind of cool results.

25
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.280
So add just a little bit more in there.

26
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.680
We got some interesting looking lake going on right there.

27
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.520
But again, with the ocean and the lake tools, you're going to see that all of the settings

28
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.079
do virtually identical stuff.

29
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.959
So once we have kind of gone over the settings once, applying them and using different settings

30
00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:41.159
is of trivial importance because once you've learned how they work once applying them to

31
00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.719
other things is going to be very repetitive, but also super simple because you've done

32
00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.759
this once already and you kind of know what each one has done.
