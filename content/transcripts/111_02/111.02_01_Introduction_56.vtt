Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440
with Epic Games.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.640
In the following video tutorial series, we're going to be taking a quick look at how to

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.759
use the water tools inside of Unreal Engine 5.

5
00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.000
This is first going to start with us enabling the water tools plugin and restarting the

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
editor.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.300
We're then going to take a look at how a world needs to be set up so that the water

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.600
tools can be utilized inside of that world.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.320
We'll then take a look at each of the tools by exploring the ocean, lake and river tools

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320
individually.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.439
We'll then take a look at how we can bind all of the tools together in one single map

12
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.480
and then we'll finish up by talking about waves and buoyancy.

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.320
We've got a lot to cover, so let's go ahead and get started with enabling the plugin.
