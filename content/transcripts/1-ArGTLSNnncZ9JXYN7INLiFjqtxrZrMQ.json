  "text": " So next up we have skeletal meshes. Skeletal meshes are made of two parts. So a mesh object for the visuals as you can see there on the right hand side, but we also have a hierarchical bone skeleton that drives the animation of the versities that makes the mesh move. So skeletal meshes are usually used but not always in the instance of characters and organic shapes. So you might have something that's been rigged in your scene, whether it be for technical art reasons, maybe it's for character reasons, but they're more often not used for those purposes. The modeling, rigging and skinning process is achieved in the DCC app. So you do the majority of the work inside of your external software. That data then gets brought into Unreal Engine. So when you import inside of Unreal Engine, as long as you have a root bone in your DCC app, Unreal will detect that it can be a skeletal mesh and set up the relevant FBX import options for you. So the process of importing skeletal meshes into Unreal is very similar, shall we say, as a static mesh import process, just with a few additional options. So the FBX import process for skeletal mesh automatically creates a skeletal mesh actor. So you don't need to create the skeleton yourself. Unreal Engine will generate that for you based on the hierarchy of what you had in your DCC app. So it'll also create the assets to control the hierarchy, the animations and the physics. So you'll get your own physics body actor as well, which you can set for, you know, if you need any specific requirements there. And it's commonly, you can add animations to your skeletal mesh and blend them using the animation blueprints and sequences. So once your raw data is inside of Unreal Engine, you can then assign animations based on that inside of Unreal Engine.",
