  "text": " Now that we have some actors placed in our scene, let's talk about how we can manipulate these actors. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to select everything, and then over in the Details panel underneath Transform, we're going to zero out the location. This is just going to make it easier for us to find everything to begin with, and make sure that everything is starting on the same Z height, as that's really important for this particular style of game. Let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and do this now. With the editor open, what we're going to do is we're going to select our VP platform. I'm going to hold down Control, select our depth volume and the wind volume. Then I'm going to come over here to Transform, and under Location, I'm going to reset this property to its default value. Boom, right there, we have everything centered. What I'm going to do now is we're going to pull the wind volume out here, and then I'm going to pull the depth volume down, and we'll put it down to negative, say, 500. Then with that, what we're going to do is I'm going to hit the Spacebar once, and again, to get the scale widget, then I'm going to scale this in the Y and the X axes, just to make up some of the play area. Then I'm just going to hit Play real quick, and just to double-check to make sure everything is working. Boom, there we go, that's what we want with the Game Over menu, so cool. All right, one thing, if you get stuck like this, one of the cool things we can do is we select Platform and hit F, automatically focus in on that platform. What I want everybody to do now is take a few minutes and add some platforms to your level. You can hold down Alt and drag. What we want is we just want to add a few of these platforms so that we can jump across them and eventually hit this wind volume right here. Let me just simulate that, and go ahead, one and, oh, almost didn't make it, there we go, we have one, our project. So, again, you can add as few or as many platforms as you would like. Just remember, the more platforms you add, the more settings you will have to set up in the next section, but I encourage you to really spend a little bit of time just moving these around, placing them, and things of that nature.",
