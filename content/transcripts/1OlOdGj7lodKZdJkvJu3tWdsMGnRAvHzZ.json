  "text": " So now we have our components in place. We're going to go over to the event graph and start putting together our logic. The logic is going to say when the player enters the box, that volume that we put down here, it's going to allow the player to actually interact with the door. And when the player leaves the box, it will cancel their ability to interact. This is done very simply. In order to get an event from the box overlap, we're going to select the box overlap component right here in the upper left. Then we're going to go over to the details panel on the right here and scroll all the way to the bottom. Here we can see a whole load of different events which are attached to this component. In this case, we are going to select the component begin overlap and the component end overlap. The event actor begin overlap, which we have on the event graph at the moment, is actually rigged for all components of the actor, not just the box. So we don't need this in this instance. Actually we don't need any of these events, so we're just going to delete them. So instead, I'll go back to the box component and go down to the events and I'm going to click on the component begin overlap to add it to the event graph and also the on component end overlap. As you can see on both of these nodes, there is a lot of output pins which will provide us a lot of information which will be of use to us. With both of these event nodes in place, we can actually begin testing to see if this is working. So if you pull off the execution pin on the begin overlap and drop it down, let's search for a print string node. The print string will create a small debug message in the top left hand corner of the editor whenever this node is fired. In this case, whenever we run into this box, it is going to print the string which is in the header. By default it will say hello. Let's change that to something a bit more useful. Let's change it to entered volume. There's also a drop down here that will allow you to change the colour or how long it will remain on the screen, but we're just going to leave that as the default for the time being. Now let's do the same thing on the component end overlap. Pull off the execution pin, drop down and search for the print string. For this print string, let's change the text to exited volume. In order to be ready to test it, we first need to compile the script and you can save it too, even though this isn't absolutely necessary. Now if we come back to the editor and drag our door into the level, hit play. Now when I fly out the door, you can see the message enter the volume and when I fly away, it will say exited volume. Now that we know it's working, let's go back into the blueprint and put the real script there instead of the debug script. Now what we're going to do with this is we're going to turn on the ability for the player to interact with the door upon entering and leaving this volume. Delete both of the print strings that we have there at the moment and drag off and search for the node enable input. And press enter and then let's go down to the component end overlap, drag off of here and search for disable input. When you've found that press enter. This is basically going to do is tell the player controller that we've chosen in this case that we will allow this actor to accept input from the keyboard or the mouse or whatever external hardware we have. The opposite is the same thing for the disable, but it means that it can no longer read the hardware. Actors cannot read inputs from player controller by default, so this sort of overrides it. Now there are other ways of doing this, but we're just going to use this method for simplicity sake. There's one more thing that we need to do in order to turn this on and that's to take this player controller node and drag backwards and type in get player controller. So this object will go and find the player's controller and make that the input for this. Now we can also drag off that same player controller node and connect that up to the disable input. So this is going to disable and enable input for self, which is a reference to the BP and it's going to allow that input to the player controller. This is a little bit harder to test. However, we can do this by creating a new event. So if you would right hand click in anywhere in the empty space around here. And then type in event keyboard E. By typing in event keyboard, I'll be getting all of the keyboard events and then by putting in E, I'm going to be getting the first one that starts with the letter E, which is the E key in this instance. I'm going to select that and this works for pretty much any keyboard button or if there is a specific hardware button that's common, you just search for it. There's probably an event for it. In order to test this, let's pull off on pressed and we're going to print a string again. In this case, it's going to say used door instead. So how this is going to work is we are going to enter the volume and this is going to enable the input here. And then if we press E, it's going to print the string and then afterwards, if we leave the volume, it will disable the input and this E will no longer work. So that's how it's going to work. These two will enter the date and this is the actual input. If I compile and we save and I hit play now. If I find the door now, nothing's going to happen because we got rid of those first two print strings. But if I hit E now, it's going to say used door. If I move outside the box and try pushing the E button again, nothing's going to happen. So that's how we got the first part done. Now we just need to make the door rotate.",
