  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to go over the outline for the introduction for lighting for this series of courses. And then we're also going to be looking at terminology and types. So let's get started. So the course outline for these series of videos is first we're going to look at lighting terminology and types. That entails lighting definitions and types, static versus dynamic, and light types overall. Later on, we'll look at lighting properties and settings. Light properties and how to control them and light mobility and how it plays with your light concerning which type of light, GI, global illumination, direction you're going. Then we'll look at an introduction to Lumen. What is Lumen? How to set it up, quality control, tips and tricks, and Lumen visualize. Later, we'll look at Nanite and virtual shadow maps. Why use Nanite? Using it, how to set it up, and virtual shadow maps as an overall whole view of how it works. Later on, we'll look at lighting tools, environment light mixer, and light mixer. And we're going to do an interactive build of light for our hero object that I've given to you guys. And it'll be a lot of fun. So let's go ahead and take a look at lighting terminology and types and how that's all working with Unreal. First up, we'll look at direct lighting. What does that mean when it comes to this real time scenario? A lot of people can be unfamiliar with Unreal, specifically in lighting, because real time is very different than an offline renderer. In this particular case, direct lighting is a light that falls onto the surface without any interference. The light travels directly to the surface and that surface receives the full color spectrum of light. We also have indirect lighting. You'll see that many times in the details for particular lights that you're working with. It's a lighting that has been reflected by other surfaces nearby. As the light bounces off these surfaces, light waves are absorbed or reflected based on the surfaces properties and passed on to the surface you were looking at. Thus indirect lighting contributes to the mood and overall light intensity. We also have shadows. Now there's several ways to approach shadows, but in Unreal there's the bake method. And you'll see in Unreal takes a snapshot of the mesh actor from light's point of view and projects that information on another mesh actor on the opposite side. In the case of virtual shadow maps, shadows update in real time using mesh distance fields for accurate calculations and updates with movable lights. So static versus dynamic, what does that exactly mean when it comes to Unreal? Let's break this down. We have a brand new system that came through with Unreal 5 and that is Lumen. It's our fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system that is designed for next generation consoles, but it is not limited to consoles or games. It can be used for final pixel. It can be used for VR training or VR experiences, and it can be used for virtual production. It is the default global illumination and reflection system in Unreal currently. Lumen renders diffuse, inter-reflection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections and large detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. So it's really nicely optimized so it can scale down nicely to your needs. Now baked static lighting and also stationary, which stationary is used in that particular direction, is pre-computed rendered lighting. Baked lighting is created using Unreal's lightmass radiosity, Baker. And you'll see that when the thing called swarm, you'll see it on the bottom of your screen or swarm agent, which will appear if you are using the baking system. It'll be on the bottom right hand side. Typically, it is similar to rendering lighting with V-Ray or Corona, etc. It is used to create high quality indirect lighting using light and shadow maps. Baked lighting cannot be altered at runtime, but has little impact on real time performance. Now static lighting is your primary baked source. Stationary light is used within that scenario. Stationary light can be used for movable objects, for objects moving in the environment, and static would not affect those lights. So there's a lot of give and take. You have to be very strategic and deterministic when using baked lighting. But baked lighting can give you some really cool results at a cheap cost, yet not quite as realistic or performance ready as Lumen when it comes to being able to change things on the fly. Now real time, that takes us to our next topic, real time dynamic lighting. It's lighting that is updated each frame. It is fully dynamic and can be moved around and modified at runtime. It has no global illumination component, only direct light. It is also expensive to use, affects real time performance. Now dynamic light in the sense that you're outside of Lumen, so you use a dynamic light in baked mode, you're not going to get the GI that you're necessarily going for. But that's where Lumen kind of breaks the mold. Unreal can use both static and dynamic lighting. That's that note here. So architectural visualization will do this sometimes, although now they're using more of Lumen. But the projects, the project assets typically stationary and baked static lighting is mostly used, older way. Now Lumen can be used, but there is currently some reflection limitations. So when you're using Lumen, you're going to be leaning more towards fully dynamic, where your light is movable and Lumen will give you global illumination. So that's kind of breaking the old mold. It's basically the new guard. It's a new way to do things. Now before Lumen, there was ray tracing. So ray tracing, this type of lighting is real time global illumination updated with all lights set to movable. If they are animated, the GI updates on the fly. And the same thing goes with Lumen because Lumen borrows some of that architecture. Some aspects of ray tracing is taking into account with Lumen, as you see in the bottom here, such as reflections and some light calculations. So each one of these has a very specific mindset when you start diving into it. Now we're not going to get into ray trace for this first course, but we will talk about Lumen specifically. We're not going to get into baking and how to work with a baking scenario that is for the other classes, more advanced classes coming down the pipe. For the most part, we're going to be focusing more on Lumen. So the types of lights and how to use them. We're going to get more into the properties and how to edit them. But for this particular section, we're going to just give you an overview and how these work. So directional light. Awesome. It works just like a regular directional light you would have with Maya or 3D Studio Max or many other 3D packages. It is your primary sunlight. There's also the point light. Notice I put Omni here. Well, if you're more of a 3D Studio Max person, you'll get that point. It works kind of like a bulb or a mini sunlight, and it can be used definitely for particular scenarios. There's the spotlight, which is your typical spotlight with Unreal. Has that per number and has a cone angle. All those things can be controlled. We also have the rec light. Rec light is great. Now you hear me repeat this several times. The rec light is like a series of point lights within a square that can be shaped into a rectangle and many shapes and forms. And we'll get into that later. It is one of my favorite ones for fill light. It works fantastic. Then we also have the sky light. Now the sky light is used many times with architectural rendering. They'll pull into the scene. And I like to use it too because it gives me a nice little GI bounce everywhere. Your sky light can also be attached to an HDR image if you want to. Otherwise it will use the information, the data in the scene to bounce your light around. But you can load an HDR image such as ones you can get at each year Haven. They work really great. And those are open source. There's also a chair backdrop, which is similar to the skylight. But in the fact that it is a backdrop where you can actually see the image, but it will also bounce the light around like you would with a skylight. So it's using the HDR, HDRI backdrop. It's a predefined HDR. Now this one typically is used a lot of times for product and for vehicles. It's not necessarily used for in a game scenario. And if it's used for virtual production and you just need something down and dirty, it might be perfect in some scenarios. But not really for final pixel or for video games. And the fact that if you turn your camera, you can kind of see that it's kind of fake, but it works really great. There's a lighting blueprint set up for it and it may be great for what you want to do. May not. But if you want realism, you might want to steer more towards directional light, skylight and a few of the other lights, depending on your scene. But it's really great. A lot of our product people use them. Our clients such as automotive and architectural. And the next we have sun and sky. So this lighting blueprint allows you to pull this into the scene and makes it so that you can change the time of day using longitude and latitude. And we're not going to get really deep into these last two. These recovered in some other classes. But for the most part, we're going to be covering skylight, rec light, spotlight, point light and directional light. The sun and sky is great because you can actually drag it into a scene and then you can again, like I said, you can punch in your exact time of day that you need. Latitude, time of day and so forth. Now, it's not quite as robust as you would get as I think 3D Studio Max is one. And I think Maya also has one with the longitude and latitude. Max is a little bit more robust, I believe. But it gets pretty close. That's it for this course. And you can see we have a link here if you want to dive in a little deeper. In the next course, we're going to look at lighting properties and settings. Thanks again.",
