  "text": " Hi everyone, in this video we're going to look at some quick pro tips when it comes to subsurface as well as a sneak preview of some other elements that we're developing here at Epic Games. So let's get started. So when you are making your subsurface material, it's best to customize your subsurface material with full control of properties, which you saw me do for the Jade material. And you're more than welcome to grab that and edit it and create your own from it. It's not a problem. Megascans export or plug-in material creation transmission effect, not as strong as customizing the subsurface material. So if you do find flesh or meat and you want to create a subsurface, remember when you export it for Megascans, you're going to need to turn on either a subsurface, use and turn on a subsurface profile or subsurface in general to be able to get that light transmission the way that you want. Otherwise, it's not going to look great. So customize as much as possible. And this will give you the best control and be able to do things that you need in the instance material. So keep those things in mind. If you're using the parallax control, some of the nodes to keep in mind is a temporal AA can be used to jitter the number of rays slightly when you're creating a parallax occlusion effect inside your material. This causes traces to be out of phase and cancels out artifacts over time. So you got to be careful that you can still get artifacts. As we saw as we moved our camera to the side and we moved our light around, we saw that it was a little bit noisy on certain angles. Shadows can be adjusted manually and might need to be for accuracy and must be activated in the function. Note this is an expensive material. Now that might be better. So again, I mentioned that doesn't mean you can't use it or shouldn't use it. Every scenario is different. Distributable depth offset can also be added for accurate intersections if other geo is introduced. So flatter the surface the better. If your surface is lifted or pushed forward, you could run into some problems and get some weird banding and strange effects which happen. Note if a height map is introduced, steep maps will have noticeable stretching. To fix a world alignment texture can be used or tiling options on troubled areas. So you can try the world alignment texture to try to fix those values, but no guarantee. So you just got to make sure you know your geometry and you know what your texture output is supposed to be your final look. So coming down the pipe and some of you might be familiar with it, we have substrate. It is one of our newer materials. Now it is still in beta, so keep that in mind as you build your scenes. Once you create a substrate, you can't go back to regular materials. So there's some limitations there. So we don't recommend them for full production. But as experimental platform support testing is currently incomplete. So just again, keep that in mind. Features UX are subject to change. So some of the tools and the nodes you put in there to be able to actually make things smoother, those may go away and new ones may go forward. Mobile is supported when using mobile forward shading. Again is experimental support for path tracer if you choose that route. Some platforms and rendering paths such as DirectX 11 and Mac exhibit issues and may not work entirely. So just keep that in mind. We have a class on this if you want to take it. So I just wanted to point that out. So there's even better, better, stronger, cooler things coming. But everything take it with a grain of salt because this particular one he's still in beta. Here's some links to what some of the topics that we talked about. Make sure you check him out and expand your knowledge even further.",
