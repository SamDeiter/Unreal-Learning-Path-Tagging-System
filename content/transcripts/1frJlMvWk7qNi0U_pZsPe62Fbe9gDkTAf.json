  "text": " In this video, we're going to cover what Open Sound Control is, where it came from, and its many use cases. Open Sound Control is a data transport specification, similar to MIDI or DMX, and it's for real-time message communication among many different kinds of application and hardware. This is often referred to as peer-to-peer messaging, and this works not just in Unreal Engine, but in a wide variety of different softwares, including QLab, TouchOSC, MaxMSP, and many, many more. We've used OSC in many cases, not just to send simple messages back and forth, but even to utilize a fairly robust multiplayer setup without having to deal with the limitations of a server-client relationship in a traditional sense, such as where when a server crashes, the clients are no longer able to stay in a session. Through OSC, as you'll see, we can send signals as needed, and if anything goes wrong with those signals, they can simply be sent again, and because none of the quote-unquote clients inside the session are actually being hosted by a traditional server, there's no problem if anything goes wrong with that server. It can always come back and send those messages once more. To add onto that, the way we use it to replace our traditional multiplayer, OSC gave us a lot more flexibility. We can be selective about the things we want to send, and because we're not buying to a traditional server, we can be very flexible about our session. Sometimes we can have a session still running without a server. We can have multiple computer being the server. That's a lot of more flexibility and benefit comes from using OSC as a communication method. OSC, again, refers to Open Sound Control, which is unfortunately a bit of a misnomer because OSC can be used for a wide variety of purposes. We can send integers, strings, floats, a wide variety of different kinds of signals besides just sound. But OSC was basically developed to be an alternative to MIDI. Anyone who's played on a keyboard piano before has probably heard of MIDI in the way that you can send music signals to a computer. Well, MIDI was pretty limited in terms of how it was able to send messages, so OSC was designed essentially to be a more robust way to send different kinds of messages with more complexity and is now widely used across a wide variety of industries. Some of the benefits of OSC compared to MIDI include a higher resolution because OSC can send full floating point numbers and a wide variety of other data types, and MIDI 7-bit messaging is highly limited by what it can do. We have flexible addressing because OSC messages can be structured with a hierarchy, kind of like URLs, which allows for much more organized and descriptive communication. We also have extensibility because users can define their own message formats and address spaces as you'll see the way that a OSC message is sent looks a lot like a directory or URL, and that makes it adaptable to a wide variety of applications beyond just sound and music. And lastly here, we mentioned that we have network-centric design because OSC was designed with a modern networking infrastructure, well past when MIDI was created where networking was much more limited. And so it's a well-suited format for any kind of internet or LAN-based communication. And what June and I will be showing you today involves both sending messages locally when you're on the same subnet, as well as opening up ports and sending data across the internet. As previously mentioned, OSC can be used across a very wide variety of industries such as music production, theatrical and live show control, performance capture, virtual production and interactive art. Here on this page, we have an example of a show that June and I were involved with with our company Agilens a few years ago, A Christmas Carol VR. And the way that this show was able to function was queues were able to fire from another piece of software called Touch OSC, basically mimicking the same queue board that we had constructed inside Unreal Engine 4.27, which meant that if there was anything wrong with the host who was sending out queues in Unreal Engine, we could actually send out exactly the same signals from this other software, which could run on Windows or Mac or even something like an iPad, just allowing for a much more robust and flexible way to control the show. In the next video, we'll look at some of the core concepts of OSC, including how it gets implemented directly in Unreal Engine.",
