  "text": " Now that we have taken a look at the Niagara content examples and found out how we can utilize those examples to help us build the effects of our own, let's take a look at Niagara as a whole, because Niagara's emitters are actually made up of a collection of smaller parts. What I mean by that is at the very top we have a Niagara system. Now each Niagara system that we create is actually going to be comprised of Niagara emitters. So inside of one Niagara system we can have multiple emitters that can do multiple different things to our effects. Those emitters themselves are actually made up of Niagara module scripts and Niagara parameter collections. And the reason for this is that everything with Niagara is meant to be easy to share and easy to reuse throughout your entire Niagara production process. Now this does make creating a brand new effect a little of a daunting task and not to worry. Niagara has a very, very fantastic setup wizard that you can use to help you get started with whatever effect you're trying to create. When we go to actually create a new Niagara system, we have this option presented to us, like we see on the screen in front of us, that allows us to either select a new system from a selected set of emitters so we can mix and match different emitters that already exist, or we can start from a brand new system with nothing inside of it. If we do decide to select from a new system, once we select that option and hit next, we'll then be able to pick our various starting points. If we want a particular system, all we have to do is select it and then press the green plus icon to add it. Right here we have this emitters to add. As we add more emitters to this, this will have more and more options in it. This is really cool because this means that we can have multiple emitters inside of one Niagara system and control them. Kind of like if we were going to make a firework, we could have the start, the explosion, and then the end. Instead of managing three separate sets, we could do that all in one Niagara emitter. Now the Niagara editor UI is going to be very similar to other editor UIs you've used inside of Unreal. One across the top, our main toolbar is going to be where we browse and save, compile. We can capture a thumbnail for the content browser as well as view this object's rendering balance or the extent at which it will render out into the world. Our performance as well as debug information. We can even simulate there is a way to bake more expensive effects down to a set of 2D textures. And then our scalability options, which allow us to enable or disable certain things inside of our system for performance reasons on lower end systems. View is our viewport, and this is going to work like our standard viewport and many of the other editors that you've utilized. From here we can do things like adjust how we're looking at this. Maybe we want to look at it from the left hand side or the right hand side or from perspective. We can then adjust our lighting and even turn performance information on and off. Three over here, this is where we're going to set our parameters or our user parameters or adjust any local modules. So parameters and user parameters are going to be things that are already set for us by default. And that would be a parameter and the user parameter would be something that we are going to expose so that when we put this in the level an artist or a designer doesn't actually have to open up the effect to adjust it. They can do it right within sight of the level from the user parameters that we exposed. Local modules are more of an advanced concept and they deal with any customized scripting or things like that that we're going to be doing. But we're not going to be touching on that in this particular class. For the timeline curves, Niagara logs and script status, this little box down here, this is basically the timelines allow us to control when an effect inside of our Niagara system is going to fire off. This isn't for time lining properties. This is just for controlling if we have multiple emitters inside of this one Niagara system. It's for controlling when they start and stop. The curves is just a larger, easier to use curve window if we are going to be using curves to modify any behavior. And then the log and script stats are going to show us any errors that we might have or script errors. Five over here is the selection. This is going to act like our details panel, as with many of the other editors. This is going to be context sensitive. So what we have selected will populate this panel with different information. Finally, we have six right here, which is our graph or system overview. And this is where we're going to be spending a lot of our time. Now, notice that this is broken up into two different things here. We have a Niagara system five and blowing particles. So this Niagara system is this effect as a whole. And this blowing particles is the emitter inside of this effect. So we can actually have multiple emitters inside of this one effect. And this is really cool stuff. Now, the last thing that I want to talk about before we jump into our example is how the actual VFX inside of our Niagara system works. So this blowing particles, this little. So this emitter that we see right here, we're going to refer to this as the stack and the stack operates in a top down execution. So properties, emitter summary, emitter spawn, emitter update, particle spawn, particle update render. The stack starts the top and goes down to the bottom. Notice that each one of these has a red or a green plus mark next to it. And this is how we add behaviors to our particles. If we click on this, say we click on the one under particle update, we are going to see a whole bunch of different parameters that we can adjust. Further, one of the other cool things about this is the inputs can also have various properties set on them. So, for example, if we want to come here to our lifetime min and we click on this little chevron, we're going to get the ability here to change this by a whole bunch of different things. The coolest thing about this is we can also do expressions on this. So if you know of a little formula that you'd like to do, you have the ability to do that. We can do just a straight float value or if we wanted to, we could put in here like a lerp between two numbers and things like that. So you can get really, really, really complicated with your inputs as well as the modules that you're putting on them. Now, if you still don't really understand everything, that's OK. We're going to go over all of this stuff in the next section, creating your first effect in Niagara.",
