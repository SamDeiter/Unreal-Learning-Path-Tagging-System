  "text": " In this video, we're going to take a look at the primary nodes and textures. So let's get started. So the primary PBR, our physical base rendering inputs here, we have is base color, metallic, specular and roughness. Now later on we'll talk about normal map and how we can use it. In our more advanced classes, we'll talk about world position offset, image inclusion and pixel depth. All can add layers of realism to your scene, as well as emissive color. But for now, we're going to focus mostly on roughness and this particular section, specular, metallic and base color. Later on we'll talk about normals in detail. So one of the first ones is your albedo in that top slot. Now that represents our flat color without any specular, specularity or shading. Nothing is baked in. Linear RGB vector 3 values of 0 to 1. Now you want to avoid pure black and you want to avoid pure white because well, they just don't exist in nature. So they're getting close, but it's not quite there. But if we look at a metallic here, we have a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1. Most common usage is either on or off, 1 or 0. When on 1, it yields 100% specular reflection. And then you can adjust anything in between based on your needs for your scene. And again, this can be done through values or this can be done through a texture. Roughness is also the same. Grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1 ranges from smooth, mirror-like surface to 0 to a rougher, matte surface and 1. Unlike with metallic, you're encouraged to fine tune the roughness value between 0 and 1 or use a texture to that effect. I like doing using a texture whenever I can. But again, if you need to keep things a little bit low maintenance, you can also run that through a value, a thing called a constant or a scalar parameter, which are both relative to each other. And I'll explain those concepts later and how they work in Unreal. Specular is also a grayscale value that ranges from 0 to 1. A rule of thumb is to set the specular value to 0.5. Now by default, it is set to 0.5. But if you wanted to keep it around and adjust it and add a little fine tune it, you totally can. But you got to be careful when using your specular that it doesn't interfere with what your roughness is doing. This they kind of do the same thing. Specular a lot of times can be used for a little more stylized look or to push particular values such as wetness or a slimy looking or overly shiny object. You can definitely do that by using specular and pairing it with your roughness. So things to consider when it comes to your texture. Your texture should always be a power of 2. That doesn't mean Unreal won't let you bring in an object that doesn't have a power of 2. The problem is if it isn't have a power of 2, your mipmap or level of detail for that texture won't work correctly. 16 by 16 all the way to 8k in size can be used. Textures don't have to be square as long as they are power of 2. Again this helps with a mipmap or a level of detail if you're unfamiliar with mipmap. 16 by 20, 2048 by 1024. You can do a combo of those and textures can affect streaming and memory management. So when you do use them, make sure you use them wisely. That only your hero objects get the higher resolution and the things not so important farther away start to degrade or I should say have applied lower texture resolution. Higher frequency textures can cause anti-aliasing artifacts. Now what that means is you have a repeating texture. Just be aware of it. You could get a moire pattern or you could get repeating noise happening and that's where you can adjust it within Unreal. So let's actually go to Unreal and take a look at some of these values and how to control them. So in Unreal I have a few materials here that are PBR and this particular one here we're going to pick on. I'm going to go ahead and find him in the content browser by clicking on my magnifying glass over a folder and I'm going to double click on the salt mine albedo and get his texture to show up. You'll notice at the top we have RGB controls. This allows us if we were to pack a texture or paint particular texture details on each particular channel we can actually see that and see how it's being distributed and also see how whatever DCC I use to make this how it is being digested from Unreal and you can see as we turn each one on and off we can see that display. You can also reimport if you've made some changes which is pretty helpful. You'll see a save as you've made any changes as well as trying to find and browse any particular details that you might need. So in here we can see here that we have a mipmap generation settings from texture group. Now if you needed to sharpen it because there's noise you have that option and blur it if you need to. So we talked about repeating patterns and that's where that's going to be key. There's an LOD bias we can keep that at zero so it's give us the highest detail and rely on the mipmap generation settings to be able to control things. And you can decide what it's being used for. This helps with texture compiling. Is it a weapon? Is it something for the world? And in this case it is the world. Is it a character or vehicle? Unreal that helps it prioritize and make things a little bit faster and cleaner as you start to compile and get things in the right place. There's more advanced settings where you can downscale and a few other things but I'm not going to get too much into buttonology here. You're going to mainly focus on the meat of what it means to work with these materials and in the more advanced classes we can explore those other concepts. You can see down below here we can also control our compression as well as we can go in here and control a power of two. And this is our padding power of two to mode. You can pad to a power of two or pad to a square power of two. You can change those settings if you need it. And there's sRGB which is on by default for this particular texture the way that we have saved it. So see there's an advanced area where you can warp things if you need to adjust positioning if you need to. And we also have a kind of a poor man's Photoshop area I like to call it where we can control the brightness the brightness curve the vibrant saturation and RGB curve and hue. So you can actually tweak the texture just a bit. Now remember when you do this Unreal will keep and bookmark what your values were and you can go back to its default. But I recommend if you were to change these try to make a copy of the texture and then if you make some changes you can go back to the original and not have too much of a hard time. You'll see down below there's some compositing here. We're not going to get too much into this one but this allows you to do some more advanced settings and control in here and you can even determine where the source files coming from. Importing now importing is pretty easy with Unreal. You can literally go in here and you can drag your texture into your scene. So if I took this particular texture we're going to close them for a second. But say I decided hey you know what I need to bring in another texture. So we'll go to our in class material folder and that texture that I need is say maybe some image that I've collected. So I got an image here of my face and I want to bring in my face into the scene. I can simply drag it from let me actually pull over my senior. I can drag that right into my in class folder and there I am. Even though I am not at a power of two I can go in here and just delete myself which sounds really odd and we'll do a force delete. Now be careful whenever you do a force delete make sure there's nothing connected. In this case there isn't and Unreal will list it but I'm going to hit force delete. You really have to make sure that's exactly what you want to do when you're working with Unreal. You can also import at any time clicking the import button here as well as right clicking in say import game import into our game class name here in our in class folder and that's pretty fast so you can even drag it and there's you can also hit the import button which is really helpful in our case. So let's go back to the slides. So the textures are converted to a U asset and you can open a texture and the texture editor which you saw us do and we can simply by double clicking and we can edit it any way that we need. Now again you can control your compression settings there and even how things are being digested and what that means if we go back to Unreal for a moment those compression settings allow us and let's open up our texture again. If we needed to change things based on our needs like say this is a really high end texture and maybe I saved it wrong in another package or it's being digested a little bit weird in Unreal I can convert that to what I need. Now again that's properties need to be placed and effective within our texture if you were to use them. So if it isn't an HDR you wouldn't want to show they converted here but you have those options to be able to control your compression which is really nice in Unreal. Even in some cases you may need to disable or enable your sRGB and this just depends the look and feel that you need and whether in some cases this item was a normal map or it wasn't intended to and you needed to adjust some things. That's it for this section. Here you will find in the slides a link to give you some more info. In the next section we're going to look at the material editor of Close and parent materials and how they work.",
