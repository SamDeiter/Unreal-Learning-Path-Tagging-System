  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video where we will be going through exercise two. For this we will be using the noise stimulus to detect a noise and have an ARA run towards it. So back in the engine what I would like you to do is come to the slide number two here which is exercise two noise stimulus. Now if I hit simulate what you're seeing is we have a small system here where these explosive barrels are getting dropped at random between these different areas. What I would like to do with this is make it so that the NPC character here will be able to detect it and move towards it. Now what I'm going to do is open up the state tree so that we can have a quick look and again this is very similar to the last one we were looking at. We have an out of combat section at the top where we just set the character to wander And in the second section we have a heard something and going to investigate that and wait for one second until returning back to the root. And the way that we are communicating with this state tree you can see on the left hand side here is we have an evaluator for e-hearing and all this is going to be doing is this is going to monitor two different variables a boolean if you've heard something and the location that the noise came from. OK so now let's have a quick look at the AI noise. Now for this we already have the perception update set up for us. You can see that this is relatively similar to what we were previously doing. We are looking on target perception updated and we'll update as that comes through. For this we are checking for the class stimulus and we use the AI sense hearing in this case. If this is true we are going to note something as heard and we are going to have a we're going to set the location on the stimulus location. So it's a very simple script similar to what we did in the last exercise. You'll also see that we have an event to reset these two these two values and that we will trigger just once the AI has has approached and got to it. OK now so where do we need to put the actual code. In this case you'll see that there is a BP noise maker. Now what I'd like you to do is open this up and have a look. And it has primarily one piece of code. What this does is when the when the component is hit the cylinder it will turn on a particle applied everything. Play a sound at the location. Wait one second and then destroy the actor. So it's relatively straightforward. Now we only need to do one extra thing to get this to work. And we talked about this previously but in some stimuli you are going to need to manually report when you want it to be triggered. And this is one of those cases. So what I'm going to do is drag off after the play sound at location. And I'm going to type in report noise event. And that's going to give us this noise here. I'm just going to use the actor location to plug that in. And that is all the code that I need you to do at this point. Apart from one thing we need to set a maximum range. For this I'm going to set this in as 3000. I'm going to say compile and save. You'll see that we also have a loudness. This acts as a multiplier for the range. So if you change that to two that would be make the range an equivalent of 6000. And it just allows you to have two different controls. You can change. And the last thing that I need to do is I need to note down the instigator. Before that I'm just going to grab the reference to self. And plug that into the instigator. You can now see that once the noise is reported the courage is alerted to it and will move to the find location. And if we were to have a quick look at how the AI perception component is set up. Again in this case we have a sense config that we've set up as the AI hearing. And we are setting up our hearing range. Our hearing range I've set to a very long distance. And again detection by affiliation has increased. And making sure it starts in neighbors. And that's all we need to do in order to get this up and running. So that brings us to the end of this video on using noise stimulus. Next up we're going to be doing a quick example using touch.",
