Today we'll just be selecting a new level and then also going into the landscape editing mode and I'll be jumping into editor to show you step by step how we go about doing this and then also we'll just make sure the location is at world zero and the selection size is 15 by 15 quads. You can make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs but that just gives us a good amount of space on our landscape to show you the features that we want to use today. And so let's get into creating this landscape and so I'll just go to the games tab on the launcher and then I'll select third person template. It doesn't really matter which one you pick, I'd probably pick either first or third person for this purpose and we'll go for blueprint. I will include some starter content because we'll use that in our foliage demo later and then just make sure the project location is on an SSD drive if you have it to hand because that will always give you the quickest way to access your content and I'll just call this landscape demo but you can call this project whatever you would like and then we'll jump in and start creating the landscape and then diving into how we sculpt the landscape.",
