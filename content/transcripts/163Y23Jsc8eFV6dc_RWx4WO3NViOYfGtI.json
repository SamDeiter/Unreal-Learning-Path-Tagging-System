  "text": " Let's talk about the Unreal Build Tool or the UBT. As we've just seen, Unreal is fundamentally split into modules and the engine has got a lot of them. This tool essentially regenerates your project solution by iterating over all build.cs files, discovering new DLLs that it needs to build, as well as adding any new target.cs files that you may have added as configuration options. The Unreal Build Tool runs totally independently from any development environment and can be accessed through a contextual button on the U project file. You should rerun the UBT every time files are added or removed from the project. Let's take a look at what it does under the hood. When we initialize the Build Tool, the following happens. The UBT takes a project, target platform and a configuration and then gathers all of the target.cs files and the build.cs files for its modules. With the specified target, it will create an instance of that target and then find all of the modules, source code and plugins required to successfully build that target. It will then look for all the header files for the modules, looking specifically for files that contain Unreal-related metadata. It then passes those header files to the Unreal Header Tool or the UHT for parsing to create the generated code which gets fed back into the Unreal Build Tool. The UBT then generates an action graph, which is a graph full of all the compilation and operations needed to be performed to build the desired project for a specified target and configuration. The action graph, which are essentially just cl.exe or link.exe nodes with parameters applied, gets saved into a make file so that it doesn't need to keep doing these steps constantly. It will then execute the action graph to build two projects with an executor to compile all .obj files and link them to .exe or .dlls and .pdbs. Realistically as engineers we're unlikely to interact with either the UBT or the UHT directly aside from re-running it when we update our project, but it's important that we at least have a cursory knowledge of what happens under the hood before going forward. Unlike raw C++, Unreal's flavour of C++ fully supports reflection and for the most part it revolves around the U object. The Unreal Reflection System, which is otherwise known as the Property System, is an opt-in system that gives the program the ability to examine itself at runtime. This system not only poses our game projects but also the engine and its constituent parts. All reflected types are based off of UObject, with UObject being the lowest class that we can get to in terms of the Unreal file structure. Every player, game object, bullet, visual effects, sound cue, their class hierarchy all eventually lead to UObject. We can't mention UObject without pointing out that U prefix. Unreal has got a strongly enforced naming convention system that lets us know what the class we're working with is currently based on. So as an example we can see that child classes that are not based off of Actor have got the U prefix such as the UDataAsset. Actor derived types have the A prefix such as the A exploding barrel. Structs or non UObject classes have got the F prefix such as the F explosion params or the F archive. Enums have got the E prefix and templated types have got the T prefix such as T my templated class or T unique pointer with the template being passed in. To create and mark a file as containing a reflected system type the following must be added to the class. We add a special include that being the hash include of my file name generated dot h. We then mark the class with the U class markup, a struct with a U struct or an enum with U enum. We then add the following within the class declaration body. We add the generated body macro. This will generate type depths and additional functions such as static class and static struct that are used in the reflection system to retrieve reflection data from this class. And that's it. This type is now part of the Unreal reflection system. And the editor can actually do this for you. The editor contains a new class wizard. It will generate both a header and a CPP file in a specified location and add all of this boilerplate for you. The above will mark this class as a reflected type and it will be subject to that parsing phase of the Unreal build tool that we spoke about previously. That being the phase that was looking for files containing Unreal metadata. As well as U class we can also mark up many other parts of our code to pass along to the UBT giving us extended functionality such as editor visibility or smart memory management. We can mark up member variables with U property to prevent garbage collection from nulling out the pointer or functions with U function to make them callable from blueprint. U class allows engineers to mark up members within with additional macros as well as provide additional class specifiers to this class expanding its use. For example we have blueprint type, blueprintable and abstract. But there are many other options available and a full list can be found inside objectmacros.h. The U property markup is applied to member variables within a U class and much like U class lets us specify property specifiers for a particular member. Critically it also prevents garbage collection from nulling out any cached pointers. We don't have to manage our own memory when working with U properties. They're being reference counted for us. As long as they're flagged up with the U property macro we should be fine. Some examples of specifiers that we would typically see inside a U project would be edit anywhere. This value is exposed to property windows in the editor. Edit defaults only. This value is exposed to property windows but only in archetypes. Visible anywhere. This value is visible but cannot be edited. Replicated this value is liable to network replication. Additional setup is required to actually get it to replicate but this is just the first step towards getting there. And then finally we've got transient which basically means this property is not serialized and will be zero filled at runtime. As with U class objectmacros.h has got a more definitive list. Having discussed the U property macro and how we can use it to prevent our pointers from being garbage collected. It's also important that we discuss a new addition to Unreal Engine 5. The T object pointer. Firstly it's important to note that the use of raw pointers is still a totally valid way to store your data. However, we'd recommend the use of a T object pointer instead. A T object pointer is the size equivalent of a 64 bit pointer and will convert to a raw pointer when passed into functions and stored in local variables. Its main advantage comes in editor builds where it supports lazy load behavior which will speed up your engine boot times. The T object pointer can also cache resolved object addresses. So in range based iteration it's recommended to use something like an auto ref or a console auto ref to speed up future access attempts. In terms of garbage collection this will still work the same as a raw pointer namely because we still use it in conjunction with the U property macro. Its other advantage is that it supports cook time dependency tracking. This means that their use is tracked to build up asset to asset cook dependencies. The engine itself has already been converted to use a T object pointer. So for example in actor the root component variable is now converted to use a T object pointer. So any direct interactions with this variable will need to be updated. However, the get root component still returns the same you've seen component pointer. Similar in implementation to U property U function allows engineers to give different functionality to a function based off of the meta specified. For instance blueprint callable this function can be called from blueprint. Blueprint cosmetic this function will not be run on dedicated servers so I think plain VFX or a sound cue. We've then got server this function is replicated and executed on the server. When this is called on a client its implementation will be executed on the server. So I think passing input information from the client back up to the server. We've then got client similar to server this function is replicated and executed on the client. When this is called on the server its implementation will be called on the client so I think you are updating based off of authoritative information. We've then got net multicast and this function is replicated as well and when called on the server the implementation is fired everywhere. So that would be locally on the server as well as on any relevant clients. These network functions are called remote procedure calls or RPCs. Shrugs and enums also have their own reflection markup that being the U struct and U enum respectively. U struct much like all other types of markup supports meta the most common of which being the blueprint type which lets us use this type in the editor. What it also does is allow us to mark up members of the struct itself as U property much like we would in a U class. In this way we can have pointers inside of structs with no fear of them being GC'd erroneously. U enums also support blueprint type as a meta and it lets us add U meta to individual members of the enum. For example we can hide the max member of an enum from being shown in the editor as max members are typically only used for iteration not actual gameplay designs or implementations. By no means are these the only reflection meta specifiers they're just the most common examples. Thanks for watching.",
