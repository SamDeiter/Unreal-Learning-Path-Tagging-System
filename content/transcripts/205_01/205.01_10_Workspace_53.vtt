00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
In this section, let's continue our final recommendations with a discussion about workspace

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.320
layouts.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.880
The first thing that I need to point out is that your workspace layout is entirely up

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.480
to the user.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.080
With that established, we do have some recommended layouts for specific tasks and hardware configurations.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.880
Our first recommended layout is for single monitor users doing sequencer editorial, assemblies,

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880
or layout.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.040
The position of your menu tabs is fully customizable, but it is highly recommended that you work

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.760
using a split view viewport.

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.960
So let's jump into Unreal Engine and change our layout.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.600
The first thing I want to point out is that right now I have a single view in my viewport.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.760
And I want to switch that by moving up to the little three dots in the upper left hand

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.320
corner, moving down to my layouts, and setting this as two panes side by side.

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.840
You'll notice in other videos I typically have this already set, as this is my preferred

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.360
recommended layout.

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.880
Now once they're set side by side, I want to make sure under the perspective option

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.400
that one of these is set to cinematic control, while the other is set to the default viewport.

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.280
This will allow me to move around my viewport without impacting the view of my camera that

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.040
is possessed by my camera cuts track.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.640
Once you're all set, you can save any layout that you want by moving up to the windows

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.440
tab, moving down here, and selecting to save a layout.

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.760
Just select save layout as.

23
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.640
You can also export layouts and share them among other users.

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.040
Once you have a layout saved, to load it, all you need to do is move into the load layout

25
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.920
section and choose from any of the user layouts or default layouts that are saved for you

26
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.840
to use.

27
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.560
Let's look at some other options you may consider for other functions.

28
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.800
Here is an example of a single monitor for animation work.

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.320
The more expansive viewport and stacking for the sequencer is a layout I recommend as the

30
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.440
animation tools will open up different menus and tabs but also require a larger viewing

31
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.680
area for sequencer.

32
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.320
Next, we have an example of a layout that users can set if they have a dual monitor

33
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.320
or ultra wide monitor hardware configuration.

34
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.760
Once more, I want to emphasize that your working layout is entirely customizable in order to

35
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.280
meet the individual user preferences.

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.440
I want to point out again that any workspace layout can be shared among users once it's

37
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
saved.

38
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.200
And finally, I want to warn users that on occasion you might run into a bug when switching

39
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.920
back and forth between saved layouts that will cause the engine to crash.

40
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160
So just be careful.

41
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.520
That's it for this section.

42
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.400
In our next section, we will continue with more of our final recommendations.
