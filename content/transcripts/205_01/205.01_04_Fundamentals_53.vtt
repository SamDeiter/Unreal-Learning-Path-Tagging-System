00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
In this section, let's continue our review of core concepts with a quick look at Sequencer

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.820
fundamentals.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.380
First, just a reminder that the Unreal Engine Non-Linear Editor and Assembly tool is known

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.960
as Sequencer, a tool that is used for ground-up shot creation, pre-visualization, full film

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.020
creation, game cinematic creation, and more.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.120
Actors from the Outliner or assets from your Content Browser are added into Sequencer to

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.080
create level sequence assemblies.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.000
Sequencer's user interface is shown here and broken into four distinct sections, and the

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.320
first section is right at the top.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320
That's the toolbar.

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.720
The toolbar area is where you will find several options like adding cine camera actors to

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.680
your level sequence using the camera icon.

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.200
The slate icon is used to open the movie scene capture or movie render queue for rendering.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.000
You can also adjust your frame rate, toggle on or off the automatic keyframe option, save

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.380
your level sequence, or activate the curves editor, or more.

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.400
On the far right of the toolbar, you will find the breadcrumbs, which is a navigation

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.040
tool that lets you dive into any nested level sequence shot, make changes, and then navigate

18
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
back up to the original level sequence container.

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
Next, section number two, which is the Outliner.

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.520
This is where you can add or filter tracks in your level sequence.

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.080
It also acts as the event manager, allowing you to trigger events keyframed in the timeline,

22
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.000
which is section number three.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.240
Located at the top of the timeline is the little red arrow known as the playhead.

24
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.720
Below the playhead is our tracks area, where every character, skeletal mesh actor, or static

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.800
mesh actor that needs to be animated, every audio track, shot track or camera attached

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.760
to the camera cuts track, or event trigger are all able to be keyframed.

27
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320
Under that, at the bottom is section number four, the playback controls.

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.180
These can be used to play, pause, advance frames, loop playback, or even record a performance

29
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.360
with the built-in take recorder.

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.840
This is also where your time range slider exists, so you can adjust the view and playback

31
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840
ranges.

32
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.160
So, now that you've been reacquainted with the Sequencer user interface, let's jump

33
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.960
into Unreal Engine and prepare for the animation in-engine exercises.

34
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.000
First up, let's move into the Content Browser, and located in the Courses folder, you will

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.720
find and select the SEQ20501 folder.

36
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.800
Inside that folder, you will find a Course Topics folder.

37
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.320
Inside the Course Topics folder, you will find a Hands-On folder.

38
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.960
And in that folder, there are two Topics folders, one for Anim Assembly and the other for Inverse

39
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.460
Solve.

40
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.940
Begin your preparations by opening the Anim Assembly folder and double-clicking on the

41
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.880
Anim Assembly Level Sequence.

42
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.280
This will open up the example for creating our first animation assembly.

43
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.460
This contains an SK mannequin and a few animation clips.

44
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.420
If you want to choose from any of the other animation clips to create your own track,

45
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.840
they are located in the Anim Clips folder.

46
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.180
Feel free to play around with your assembly.

47
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.560
Alright, that's it for this review section of Core Concepts, Sequencer Fundamentals, and

48
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.700
in the next section, let's review a few more Sequencer features and tools before we dive

49
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.560
into our Hands-On exercises.
