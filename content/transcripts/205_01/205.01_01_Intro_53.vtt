00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
Hello, and welcome to the Unreal Training Sequencer Animation Production Workflows.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.800
My name is Kevin Miller, and I'm an instructor for Epic Games.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
This course is one of the follow-up courses to the Sequencer Introduction Course and begins

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.720
the Sequencer Animation Track of courses.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.920
We'll begin this course with a look at virtual production, pipelines, and workflows.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.600
Then review some of the core concepts from the introduction courses, such as importing

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.280
animations and sequencer fundamentals.

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.880
After that, we will look at the sequencer features and tools related to animating with

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.320
Unreal Engine, such as the workflow features and tools that you can use while animating

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.440
in-engine before we dive into some hands-on animation practice where I will briefly cover

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.920
animation assembly and then walk through a step-by-step exercise on using the inverse

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.440
solve to modify animations.

13
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.240
Finally, we will wrap up this course with some final recommendations discussing organization,

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.740
workspace layouts, and I'll provide you with some tips and resources for continuing your

15
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.760
animation training with Sequencer.

16
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.080
Additionally, this course will also use the project SEQ9050153 from the previous courses,

17
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560
and the level map should load automatically.

18
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.560
But if the map does not load at the launch of the project, it can be found in the Content

19
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:33.880
browser under the courses, course maps, and it is the level map titled SEQ90501 map.

20
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.880
Course materials for this course are located in the courses folder under the 20501 course

21
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.640
topics.

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.840
Once again, if you ever need to reference the location of the course map, that can be

23
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.520
found at the beginning of the slide deck after the training outline.

24
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.960
Now let's move on to our first section and begin with a discussion of virtual production

25
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.840
pipelines and workflows.
