1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
In this section, we're going to continue with our hands-on animating an engine, jumping

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.580
right back into Unreal Engine and walking through using the animation assembly we just

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.460
created in the last section to apply the inverse solve.

4
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.740
As we work through the inverse solve exercise to apply the animation assembly to our control

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.860
rig, you can once again choose to follow along or skip ahead to when you see the video jump

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.700
back into the slide deck.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.180
There, we will review the steps used applying the inverse solve to the control rig in Sequencer.

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.180
Now let's get to it.

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.860
Where we left off with our animation assembly is the example that is completed and ready to go.

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.900
Now, I want to work non-destructively, so I'm going to start with the animation assembly

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.760
example that we just created and I'm going to duplicate it.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.180
And in this case, I'm going to call this inverse solve, is, ex for example.

13
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.680
And the reason I keep this short is because I'm going to be adding to this as I go through.

14
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.220
Now I've saved it again and I'm going to drag this over to the inverse solve folder.

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.820
And the reason I'm going to move over to that folder is because here I have some examples.

16
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.580
Now, if you move things around, you do want to make sure that once you're done, you right-click,

17
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.220
go up to the fixed redirectors and hit fixed redirectors to make sure that there are no

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.620
problems with any of the pathing of your files.

19
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Now, I have my IS example.

20
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.940
You can see that I'm still in my assembly example, but I want to open up my inverse

21
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.940
solve example.

22
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.560
I'm in my inverse solve example.

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240
And from here, I again want to work non-destructively.

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.060
But I want to start by adding in and working through the inverse solve.

25
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.700
This is going to bake this animation track onto the control rig.

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.600
To do that, I just right-click on the animation for the mannequin and I go right up into the

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.520
control rig section and I choose mannequin control rig.

28
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
That's going to bring up a menu and that menu is going to give me some options.

29
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.660
I'm going to ignore most of these options right now, especially the export.

30
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.180
And I could do some reduce keys, but I want to keep everything just to show you that everything

31
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.020
gets added and baked onto this.

32
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.080
So I'm going to hit create and it's going to bake pretty quickly.

33
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.780
So from there, the animation track gets muted.

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.340
And the mannequin control rig now contains every animated key for every control that

35
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.500
is applied to the entire control rig.

36
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.720
It also moves me into animation mode.

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.880
So you can see I have my anim outliner, my anim details panel, and my animation ready.

38
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.320
And my control rig is on my character.

39
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.200
Now, I'm going to go ahead and save this because again, I want to work non-destructively.

40
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.720
And from here, I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this again.

41
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.720
And I'm going to call this isanim example.

42
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.040
And the reason for that is that I want to work on the animation at this point.

43
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.820
And the first thing that I want to do for working on my animation is move up to my control

44
00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.980
rig, choose the plus button, and choose one of the two tracks that I'm going to use for

45
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.980
transforms.

46
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.780
Now, we're just going to modify this animation.

47
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.780
To modify the animation, I'm going to choose additive.

48
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.340
Now if I chose the absolute option, the absolute option would have overridden the key frames

49
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.340
that are on here.

50
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.240
From here, I'm working with my animation example, and I'm ready to start modifying my animation.

51
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.200
And I don't need the animation track anymore.

52
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920
So I can select this track and delete it.

53
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.240
Now, my animation is driven by my control rig.

54
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.800
So you can see that as I move, my controls are moving.

55
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.000
Now from here, I can just go through my animation, find some adjustments, and select any control

56
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.360
and see where I want to fix things.

57
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.780
So if I look at my feet and I see where my feet move or slide, like this move down here,

58
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.140
you can see what twists and turns happen.

59
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.100
I can go ahead and make adjustments so that things match a little bit.

60
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.740
I can fix elbows, I can fix shoulder controls, you can see where any of this stuff is in

61
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.740
here.

62
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.860
And all I need to do to make these changes is just go ahead and grab some controls and

63
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.860
move them on out.

64
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940
So let's move through the timeline and see where we start to get some pass through.

65
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.940
So a good rule of thumb is that as this pass through starts to hit here, I'm going to go

66
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.000
ahead and keyframe.

67
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.240
Just press S to keyframe.

68
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.640
And as that moves into place, I'm going to keep another S in here.

69
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.120
And you can see that's where that shift starts to take place.

70
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.320
I'm just going to keep keyframing as I'm ready to make some moves.

71
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.040
Grab a control and just push that on out, maybe raise this up a little bit so that the

72
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.400
arm moves a little bit back.

73
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.920
Maybe go ahead and rotate just a little bit so I get some other motion.

74
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.360
Push it back a little, enter a different pose.

75
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.140
And as you can see, I've got a pose that now blends in here out of the way.

76
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.340
Now I can go ahead and do this for some of the other controls.

77
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.340
Let's move to the other side.

78
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.340
You can see that it's passing onto the inside of this body.

79
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.860
I'm going to go ahead and fix that.

80
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.700
So where does that happen?

81
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.560
Right around here.

82
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.900
Let's start with a keyframe.

83
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.100
Let's move that hand so it rotates a little bit more.

84
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.240
And let's keyframe that out so that it's not passing into it.

85
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.560
So let's go ahead and key that pose.

86
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.840
Move over here.

87
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.000
And this is where we want to move it out.

88
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.280
And let's raise it up so it's not fully extended.

89
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.480
Because I don't want any hyperextension on my elbow.

90
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.720
And maybe twist that out so it moves a little bit further out.

91
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.960
Just hit S to make sure that my keyframe moves.

92
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.500
And let's also add in a little bit right over here so this kind of flows a little bit back

93
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.680
out.

94
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.740
Flop that arm a little bit more.

95
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.540
And let's move that back a little bit right over here.

96
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.980
Just to kind of get back into the original position.

97
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.540
Now I can blend in here.

98
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.920
And one thing you'll note is that as I build in my animations, I do have an option that's

99
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.980
in here that's not checked on automatically.

100
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.100
And that option is the weight.

101
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.100
So if I move into this section, you can see if I right click on the additive, I have a

102
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.920
weight option.

103
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.820
That weight option can be keyframed on and off.

104
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.300
Now as I move through, you can see I have the weight here.

105
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.180
I can blend this so that if I only add in certain animations and I scroll down to the

106
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.740
bottom of the transform, I can adjust the weight of those motions.

107
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.000
So you can see the good example here was that arm.

108
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.860
If I move between the weight on this control, I can adjust that weight just a little bit.

109
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.860
Now the value is 0 to 1.

110
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.220
So you can see that's where we were.

111
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.740
This is where we go.

112
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.920
And I can overdrive this to push it further.

113
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.640
Now I wouldn't necessarily want to do this.

114
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.280
I'm just going to go ahead and leave this as one.

115
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.160
But you can see that that option is there.

116
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.480
Now as you go through and you animate, you are going to run into the issue where you

117
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.760
want to be able to isolate what you're working on.

118
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.920
So to isolate, you just select the controls you want, make sure that you're still in sequencer,

119
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.360
and go ahead and hit the F10 key.

120
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.060
Now that will isolate the control that you're working on and show you what you've got for access.

121
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.500
Simply return to that to see all of your controls by hitting F10 again.

122
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.620
Now if you're hovering over a viewport and you hit F10, like in here where you're working,

123
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.580
and you hit F10, it's going to hide everything and you might get a little confused as to

124
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.840
what just happened.

125
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.060
If you look on your sides, left and right, you can see that all my tabs got hidden and

126
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.000
docked to the sides.

127
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.100
Now I just want to return to that, go ahead and hit F10 again and it restores your view.

128
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.520
Now as you work through your animation, feel free to polish that animation as much as you want.

129
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.560
Once you're done with your animation and you're happy with it, you can repeat this step and

130
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.160
then duplicate this again.

131
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.880
By duplicating this again, you can change this animation to AnimTrack, for example,

132
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.700
rather than being the inverse solve because this is going to be a baked track.

133
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.580
Now you can keep the inverse solve so you know which version or which iteration this is,

134
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.940
but again you're working non-destructively.

135
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.940
So from here you just go ahead and save this, then right click on the mannequin again and

136
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.440
now you want to bake an animation sequence.

137
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.800
Baking the animation sequence is going to give you a new animation path that's in here

138
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.880
and go ahead and name this to whatever the track you want to work with.

139
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.000
So in this example I'm going to call this ISNMTrack01.

140
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.720
So I want to keep this with my animation clips.

141
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.680
I'm going to make sure that I'm in the correct path.

142
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.520
For that I'm going to go into my courses folder.

143
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.120
I'm going to go into my 20501 section under my course topics.

144
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.440
I'm going to make sure that I'm in my hands-on section under my animation assembly and since

145
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.040
we're actually working with the inverse solve, I'm going to put it in my inverse solve folder.

146
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.860
I'll create a new folder for animation revisions and I'll go ahead and load that in here.

147
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.020
This way it's separated from my clips even though it's going to be a new clip.

148
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.340
Once I hit OK, I have similar options.

149
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.280
I have export options that are in here and I have a few to choose from.

150
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.420
Now I could make some modifications in here.

151
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.140
I could evaluate this in world space.

152
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.220
I could record this.

153
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.980
I can adjust quite a few different options that are in here, but I'm going to just use

154
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.980
the basic defaults for now.

155
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.540
Export that's going to create my track and you can see right here this is my animation

156
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.260
track.

157
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.420
Once that's done, I can apply this to the character and repeat the steps that I've already

158
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.420
done to polish my animation further and further and over and over.

159
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.380
Alright, let's jump back into our slides.

160
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.180
Alright, let's review everything we've just done inside Sequencer to apply the inverse

161
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.260
solve and modify the animation assembly.

162
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.320
And we started with step one, which was baking to Control Rig.

163
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.920
This is basically the inverse solve.

164
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.480
And to do this, we right-clicked on the SK Mannequin and brought up the options under

165
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.080
the Control Rig section.

166
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:58.480
There we selected the baked to Control Rig and chose the Mannequin Control Rig option.

167
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.080
This brought up a pop-up menu, which provides us options for baking and we chose the default

168
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.720
options for baking and hit Create.

169
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.400
This baked the animation assembly onto an SK Mannequin Control Rig that we are now going

170
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.500
to use.

171
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:26.040
After that, we duplicated the level sequence and added the Additive Transform track.

172
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.120
To do that, we hit the plus button on the Mannequin Control Rig, which contained all

173
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:38.640
of our keyframes and base animation that we didn't necessarily want to modify.

174
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.040
Using the Additive option in a duplicate level sequence allowed us to work non-destructively

175
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.840
to modify those animations and clean them up inside the Transform track.

176
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.160
The third step was just to animate with Control Rig to begin polishing, modifying our animation

177
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.500
in order to make it look better or to fix any overpulls or adjustments or anything that

178
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.480
didn't look right on our baked animation.

179
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.360
We also isolated select Control Rig controls using the F10 hotkey to focus on just the

180
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.400
controls that we wanted to work with inside Sequencer.

181
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.160
The end result is a slightly more polished version of our animation and from there we

182
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.280
could bake down the animation into a new level sequence.

183
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.960
That level sequence can then be applied back to the Mannequin and round tripped over and

184
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.200
over again to continuously polish our animation.

185
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.040
That's it for this section of our hands-on animating in-engine.

186
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.320
I hope you had fun applying the inverse solve and modifying your animation assembly.

187
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.580
Once again, I want to emphasize that this workflow can be used non-destructively and

188
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.360
repeated in order to polish and improve your in-engine animations.

189
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.840
In our next section, we will start to wrap up the Sequencer Animation Production Workflows

190
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.960
course with some final recommendations.
