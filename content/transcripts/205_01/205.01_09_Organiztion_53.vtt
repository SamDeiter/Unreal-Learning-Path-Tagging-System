00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, let's begin to wrap things up with a few final recommendations.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.720
And we'll begin with project organization.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.560
As demonstrated in this slide, there are levels and sublevels that allow for better organization

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600
and collaborative compartmentalization.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.120
So your environment or your persistent level will contain anything that is universally

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.720
shared within the entire project.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.160
Project sets, environments, or discipline-specific setups can live on their own sublevels and

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.560
to clarify, when I'm talking about levels, I'm referring to maps or worlds.

9
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880
I do not mean level sequences.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.720
There is a difference between these two assets.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.480
Levels get organized into sublevels and live under your persistent level depending on what

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.400
is actually needed for your project or department.

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.600
For example, your main lighting setup should live on your persistent level, as it will

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.880
be utilized by the entire project or production.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.120
Any level sequence-specific lighting setups should live in a sequencer lighting comp's

16
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.560
sublevel, so that anything specific to the level sequence that is spawnable can be connected

17
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.640
to that specific sublevel.

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.440
That way, the lights in that level sequence can be called in and out without affecting

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.900
the persistent level and causing problems between users working within that persistent

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.560
level by having the sequencer-specific lighting turn on or off when the sublevel containing

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.040
those lights is not active.

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.520
Additionally, you can also create level visibility tracks in Sequencer that allow you to turn

23
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.520
on and off the visibility of the assets in each of those sublevels so that they don't

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.280
always have to be active.

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.400
Now, I want to take a moment to emphasize just how important project organization is.

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.040
Without it, things can get really messy very fast, so I highly recommend creating nested

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.280
folder structures inside your content browser and inside your outliner to maintain project

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.880
organization as you work.

29
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.520
Another important factor in organizing level sequences is that actors within a level sequence

30
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.760
can be divided into one of two categories, possessable and spawnable.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.840
Possessable actors are intended to be possessed by each level sequence that calls them into

32
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.960
use, but ultimately, these actor types belong to the level and are actively in that level

33
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.880
the entire time.

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.640
Spawnable actors exist within the unique level sequence to which they belong and then disappear

35
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.440
when that level sequence is outside of its play range or no longer active.

36
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.760
Basically, spawnable is like pulling a book down from a bookshelf, reading the instructions

37
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.600
and then putting it back in to be used again later when needed.

38
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.320
Now, each of these can prove beneficial depending on your needs and workflows, but one of the

39
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.880
things to note is that the EPO storyboard tools do not currently support spawnable actors

40
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160
at this time.

41
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.680
Now, continuing our discussion about project organization, I want to point out that level

42
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.760
sequences can also be deeply nested within each other.

43
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.680
So let's jump into the engine and take a look at what that means.

44
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.440
Now, if we look in the Content Browser inside Unreal Engine, under the Courses folder, you'll

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.280
find in the 20501 folder under Course Topics, there is another folder called seqshortex.

46
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.160
Inside that folder, you'll find an seqfilm level sequence that if you double click on,

47
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.760
you'll find that this level sequence has been set up to contain subnested level sequences

48
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.360
that can break down the film into sequences and sequences into shots.

49
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.160
Also, shots can be varied thanks to Sequencer's Take system.

50
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.800
In practice, this works by creating duplicate shots of any shot in your level sequence,

51
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.920
as long as they live together in the same folder.

52
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.680
For us, seqscene1shots, there are three variations inside their scene1shot folder.

53
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.920
If I move over to the Sequencer timeline and right click on this particular shot, I can

54
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.720
go and move up to the takes and choose any of those three existing takes that are all

55
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.020
different from each other because I've modified the animation, lighting, or even the staging

56
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.240
of any actor within that shots level sequence.

57
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.160
Now another actor class that has a profound impact on setting up action in Unreal Engine

58
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.080
is the use of a subscenes track.

59
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.280
A subscene essentially references an existing level sequence for the express purpose of

60
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.480
layering multiple actions together.

61
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.560
This type of organization allows you to create a departmentalized level sequence organization

62
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.480
so that teams of artists can work together in real time to construct distinct portions

63
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.480
of the action-based department or discipline that can be utilized in conjunction with sublevel organization.

64
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.160
Just as we discussed for the lighting scenarios, cinematography can also do this for cine cameras.

65
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.200
Character animation can have its own subscene, so all your characters and animations can

66
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.460
live on an animation-specific sublevel as well.

67
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.220
Level blueprints or level sequence blueprints, level sequence specific effects, anything

68
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.820
that could be spotable or triggered can also live on a sublevel under the persistent level

69
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.020
and also be organized in Sequencer through subscenes.

70
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.300
One thing to note is that while subscene organization works well for most departmental organization,

71
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.020
it does not work very well with storyboarding tools at this time.

72
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.820
Attempting to use a subscene for storyboards will cause Unreal Engine to crash.

73
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.860
Finally, when working with animation in Sequencer, you might find it helpful to create folders

74
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.480
for assets inside Sequencer to keep the event manager tidy.

75
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.120
Or groups for assets while animating.

76
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.300
Just be aware that the groups window does not dock to any part of Unreal Engine, so

77
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.460
you will need to keep this window open.

78
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.760
Oh, one more thing.

79
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.300
When animating or working in Unreal Engine, you can use the F10 key to isolate selected

80
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.740
control rig controls or isolate any tab you have active in the engine.

81
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.780
F10 acts as a toggle, so if you accidentally dock all your tabs, don't worry.

82
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.340
Just hit F10 again to restore your viewport and remember, try to work non-destructively

83
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.020
by duplicating an animation asset before making major changes.

84
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.460
Alright, that's it for this section.

85
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.900
In our next section, we'll continue with more of our final recommendations.
