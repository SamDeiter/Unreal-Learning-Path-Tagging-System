00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Now, before we get into the hands-on sections of the Animation Production Workflows course,

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.480
let's talk about the Sequencer features and tools for animation.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.720
Beginning with the workflow features.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.920
So one of the features that users will run into when working with Sequencer is the Allow

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.840
Edits options.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.360
There are three options found in the Allow Edits pulldown menu, and the first is to Allow

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.480
All Edits, which allows you to make all edits to any asset in a level sequence, level, or

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
sublevel.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.640
The second option is to Allow Sequencer Edits Only.

10
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.240
This option prevents any edits you make to the assets in the persistent or sublevels

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.580
by only allowing changes to the active level sequence assets that are contained inside

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.660
the Sequencer Event Manager.

13
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.540
The last option works in much the same way as the second.

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.700
The Allow Level Edits Only option limits users to making changes only to the assets that

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.580
belong to the active level or sublevel but are not necessarily part of the level sequence.

16
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.620
Another feature you will find in Sequencer is the Motion Blending option, which is essentially

17
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.620
bone matching.

18
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.700
And that allows users to match a specific rig bone from one animation track to a previous

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.380
or following animation track by right-clicking on the animation track and choosing which

20
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.980
clip and bone to match with.

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.060
The next Sequencer feature is Animation Track Blending, and this works in conjunction with

22
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.100
Motion Blending.

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.140
Animation Track Blending includes several preset easing options, much like the easing

24
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.900
options that are available when blending camera cuts tracks, and as we build out the animation

25
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.860
assembly in the hands-on section, we will combine Animation Track Blending with Motion

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.260
Blending to create a complete animated sequence.

27
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.820
Now, working with Sequencer, users will encounter two types of Transform Tracks.

28
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.620
The first type is the Standard Transform Track that functions on any static mesh actor added

29
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.820
to Sequencer.

30
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.820
Standard Transform Tracks have four options available to the user.

31
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.740
Absolute, Additive, Relative, and Additive from Base.

32
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.540
Absolute overrides and ignores any existing keyframe animation and zeros everything out

33
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.780
at the origin or initial state.

34
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.060
This allows an animator to create new animations that replace any existing animations.

35
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.860
Additive is the next and most common Transform option that layers new or corrective animations

36
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.800
on top of the existing animations applied to an actor.

37
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.660
After that is the Relative option, which serves as a blend between Absolute and Additive options.

38
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.160
As the name suggests, this option creates animations that are relative to the position,

39
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.600
origin, and existing animations.

40
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.200
Personally, I don't use this option all that much, but it does have its purposes.

41
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.080
And lastly, the Additive from Base works just like the Additive, but uses the Base animation

42
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.880
as its origin point.

43
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.840
The next type of Transform Tracks are Control Rig Transforms.

44
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.020
With Control Rig, there are only two Transform options, Absolute and Additive.

45
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.560
These function the exact same way as the Standard Transform Tracks.

46
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.600
Absolute overrides and ignores the existing keyframes, creating a new track for every

47
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.760
control on the Control Rig.

48
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.000
While Additive is the second option, and just like the Standard Transform, Additive is also

49
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.200
the most commonly used Transform as it allows for the modification, layering, and correction

50
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.200
of any existing animations on every control in the Control Rig.

51
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.720
OK, so I want to take a moment and remind you of Sequencer's function as an Event Manager.

52
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.440
And as we work through building our animation assembly and applying the inverse solve for

53
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.800
Control Rig animation, the Event Manager is where all of your tracks and controls will

54
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.480
be located.

55
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.040
As you animate with Control Rig or add Transform Tracks and keyframes to your animation, you

56
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.560
will also be working with Sequencer's Curves Editor, activated from the Sequencer menu.

57
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.120
Additionally, I also want to note that the Curves Editor and Event Manager are not limited

58
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.260
to just Control Rig animations, but both work with Take Recorder, Cinematic Event Triggers

59
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.120
for Assets, Blueprints, Niagara, Composure, and Material Parameter Collections.

60
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.200
Alright, that's it for the workflow features of this section.

61
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.640
In our next Sequencer Features and Tools section, we will discuss working with the Animation

62
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640
Mode Tool Set.
