00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Okay, in this section, let's review some core concepts.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.280
And we'll begin with importing animations.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.960
When importing animations, there are a few things that are important for you to know.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.020
First is that we're going to be using the FBX file format to import.

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.160
And we're going to do that directly from the Content Browser inside Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.780
Things to note here is that when you import an FBX file, Unreal Engine will triangulate

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.580
the mesh associated with the rig that you are trying to bring in for that animation.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.700
If it's the first time you're importing, click Import on the Content Browser.

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.740
Select the FBX that you want to bring in.

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.240
And the first time you import a whole new character, you'll need to make sure that

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.700
the mesh itself and skeleton are imported together.

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.140
The skeletal mesh needs to be checked on in the FBX import options, as does the import

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.660
mesh option.

14
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.660
When importing animations, you have a few options to choose from when it comes to bringing

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.860
in your animation.

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.620
Starting with your animation length.

17
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.140
The options to choose from are the exported time, which is pretty much the whole animation,

18
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.060
the animated time, which is just the animated parts.

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.660
So if you start on frame 12 and give yourself a few frames to warm up without any actual

20
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.340
animation or keyframes, those warm up frames will be cut off.

21
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
Next is the set range, which allows you to manually select the frames that you want to

22
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.120
import.

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.820
The only problem with the set range is that you cannot do more than one set range import

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820
at a time.

25
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020
If you have multiple animations on a single timeline, you will need to manually select

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
the frames for each section that you want to import.

27
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.800
Next, you have the option to choose the sample rate, and you must make sure that you check

28
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.760
on import bone tracks.

29
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.460
Some helpful importing tips for you is that the transform option will fix incorrect rotations

30
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.940
from 1 DCC into Unreal Engine.

31
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.140
It will also give you the option to fix any scaling issues that you might have.

32
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.620
You also have the option of importing a uniform scale, which should correct any scaling issues

33
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.180
you might find when bringing in your asset.

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.300
Under the miscellaneous section, you might want to check on force front X axis to correct

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.340
the position so that you use Unreal Engine's Z up axis.

36
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.100
To use Unreal Engine's preferred unit of measurement, which is centimeters, you want to convert scene

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.780
Now, if you're bringing in animations for old skeletons, you just import that like normal.

38
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.020
Select the skeleton you want, choose the animation length, and if the skeleton is exactly the

39
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.980
same, then it should be pretty straightforward.

40
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.600
If not, you may have to retarget it with the new Retargeting toolset.

41
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.240
When adding purchased animations to the Library tab, just add the project directly or add

42
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.920
your animations to a different project and migrate just the specific animations that

43
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.840
you are interested in using in your project.

44
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.200
Now, your animation will probably need to be retargeted, and that's because it likely

45
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.800
comes with its own skeleton that doesn't match exactly what you're going to find in the

46
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.840
SKMany or SKQuin character rigs, or the metahumans that you might be building and bringing into the engine.

47
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.200
OK, that's it for this review section of Core Concepts, Importing Animations.

48
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.880
In the next section, let's review a few Sequencer Fundamentals.
