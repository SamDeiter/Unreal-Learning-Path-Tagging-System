00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, this section will wrap up this course with a few more final recommendations, providing

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.360
some tips and resources for you to use as you continue your Sequencer training in Unreal

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.600
Engine.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.960
Here are a few tips we've covered before focusing on the Sequencer timeline tricks and notable

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
hotkeys.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.520
Now, I used some of these in the previous course videos, so please try them out and

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.720
see which ones work best for your workflows.

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.200
Here are a few additional notable shortcuts for Sequencer.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.120
And as usual, the 2014 Fortnite Whitepaper is still a valuable resource, providing insight

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.080
into the Epic Games cinematic process.

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.240
Feel free to follow the link and download the paper.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.040
Once again, I would highly recommend that if you want to learn more, our online documentation

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.160
has a robust section for cinematics and Sequencer available for free online, as there is even

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.720
more that can be done in Sequencer than I could possibly cover in these course sessions.

15
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.160
Finally, all the online resources and links to some of the tools discussed today can be

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.200
found by following the URLs on this slide.

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.440
Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference.

18
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.480
That's it for the Sequencer Animation Production Workflows course.

19
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.680
I want to thank you for spending your time with me, and I hope that these videos were

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.760
helpful as you continue working with Sequencer in Unreal Engine.
