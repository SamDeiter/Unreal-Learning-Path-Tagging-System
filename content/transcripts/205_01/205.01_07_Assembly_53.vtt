1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
In this section, we're going to do some hands-on animating in Engine, and we'll start out by

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.480
diving right into Unreal Engine and walking through the creation of a simple animation

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.620
assembly in Sequencer using a few performance capture animation clips.

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.260
As we work through the animation assembly exercise, you can choose to follow along or

5
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.960
skip ahead to when you see the video jump back to the slides and review the steps used

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.200
for creating the animation assembly in Sequencer.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.280
When starting out without a provided library of animation, you will need to import your

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.680
performance capture animations and then duplicate the original captured data.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.440
Review the performances and duplicate the performances again for each clip you want

10
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.560
to create for your assembly.

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.360
Then edit and trim down the clips so that they are ready to use in your animation assembly.

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.680
So let's get started.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.460
If you see where we left off, this is the animation assembly example that is already

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.620
inside the animation assembly folder with the folder for the animation clips.

15
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.020
Now rather than start out with something that's already done, let's go ahead and make this

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.540
ourselves.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.380
So to do that, I'm going to go ahead and right-click in my content browser, move up to my cinematics,

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.860
and create a new level sequence.

19
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm going to call this AnimAssembly EX, for example, and go ahead and hit Enter, then

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060
double-click to open it on up.

21
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.180
From there, I'm going to need a mannequin to put into this level sequence.

22
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.220
For that, I'm going to go up to my outliner, select my SKMannequin TS example, and grab

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580
this character and drag it into Sequencer.

24
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.100
Now if I look at this character, it pops in with the control rig on it.

25
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.920
Now I don't want to do that.

26
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.140
The control rig will override any animation and I need the animation to be what's driving

27
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.780
the control rig.

28
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.540
So before I get started with my animation clips, I'm going to go ahead and delete the

29
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.700
control rig.

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.300
Now I have a couple ways I can add in my animation.

31
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.540
I can either hit the plus button and choose from any animation in my list, or I can go

32
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.820
ahead and grab some animation clips from inside the AnimClips folder.

33
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.780
Now I'm going to start out with the Mani Walkup.

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.100
So I'm going to go ahead and drag this on in and I'm going to move this on over.

35
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.620
And this is a bit long for the walkup.

36
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.880
I'm going to keep this pretty short so we can add in more clips.

37
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.500
And I actually want a little bit more time, so let's move up into my viewport here and

38
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.940
you can see where this red 150 exists.

39
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.780
I'm going to go ahead and extend that to 300 frames.

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.180
Now at the bottom here in my timeline, you can see that it says 300 300.

41
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.380
There's no space on the end, but I need a little bit of buffer space just to see and

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.980
to give myself some room to see where the end of my animation actually is.

43
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.940
I'm going to change this to 330.

44
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.580
And I'm going to change this negative 15 to negative 30.

45
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.980
Now I have a little bit more space to work from and I want to see where we're going in

46
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.260
my animation.

47
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.420
So starting out here, you'll see that the animation is going all the way up to the walkup

48
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.060
and I can probably shorten this up a little bit.

49
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.940
So let's go to about frame 135 and let's go ahead and grab this blue mark here and just

50
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.860
drag this on over to 135.

51
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.380
From here, I'm going to move to about frame 60.

52
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.100
Yeah, about frame 60.

53
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.540
If I want to be exact, I can actually type in the number here that will take me exactly

54
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.740
to where I want to be.

55
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.220
So right at frame 60, I think this is a good cutting point.

56
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.820
If I'm on my animation and I right click, I can trim this by right clicking, going up

57
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.580
to edit and trim selection left.

58
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.460
That's going to give me a shorter animation clip.

59
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.300
I'm going to move this all the way down to the zero to start out here.

60
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.340
Now I'm going to need some more animation.

61
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.740
So let's go ahead and choose the head scratch or shrug.

62
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.500
Now it's up to you on which ones you want to use or what animation you want to work

63
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
with.

64
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.660
For me, I'm going to go ahead and choose the shrug.

65
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.100
So I'm going to start right here, right around 220.

66
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.180
I'm going to right click and I'm going to go ahead and edit and trim selection left.

67
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.500
Then I'm going to drag my shrug all the way down and with my shrug set, I'm going to go

68
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.660
ahead and go until the arms collapse and relax a little bit.

69
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.340
Right here at about 170.

70
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.460
From that, I'm going to go ahead and drag this on over so that this clip is 170 frames

71
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.020
total so far.

72
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.100
And then from here I need to add in some extra steps.

73
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.460
So from this position, I have a couple options.

74
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.260
Instead I'm going to start with a big giant sidestep.

75
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.300
Now this is a little bit long and it doesn't move quite where I want it to go because it's

76
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.140
on the opposite side, but we're going to fix that in just a little bit.

77
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.260
So before he starts to move, go ahead and put that right in here.

78
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.620
And I'm going to go ahead and right click, edit, trim selection left.

79
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.580
Move that on over and then let's choose some small sidesteps.

80
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.740
Now I'm not going to trim these down.

81
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.580
I'm just going to leave these where they are because I'm going to need some extra animation

82
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.820
at the end here to make sure that this all lines up.

83
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.360
But the first thing that we need to do is our bone matching.

84
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.120
So to start off, we're going to bone match the entire clip.

85
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.560
I'm going to go ahead and select everything.

86
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.000
And I'm going to go to animation, move up and blend first child of root.

87
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.580
That's going to blend them all together, but it's not going to do all of them.

88
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.240
So this is where bone matching comes into play.

89
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.940
For that, I'm going to go up and select the second clip in my timeline.

90
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.800
I can choose the first clip, but I'm going to choose my second clip.

91
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.120
I'm going to move from second clip to previous clip every time I match.

92
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.960
So this clip, I'm going to right click and go to match bone in the previous clip.

93
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.040
I'm going to choose my root.

94
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.880
Then I'm going to go ahead and choose my pelvis.

95
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880
Same thing.

96
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.200
And I'm going to scrub through to see how they line up.

97
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.160
So they pop a little bit.

98
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
That's OK.

99
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160
I want to match them again.

100
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.120
Let's go back up and match with the previous bone clip.

101
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.160
And let's choose now the foot.

102
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.080
So I'm going to choose part of the foot, which is going to be the ball on the left side.

103
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.360
You'll see him popping a place again.

104
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.400
And you see that gets us a little bit closer here.

105
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.680
Now I'm going to go through quickly and I'm going to go ahead and do the same thing with

106
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.360
my sidestep.

107
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.680
So if I look at my sidestep, you see it's way over there.

108
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.320
I'm going to go ahead and do the same thing.

109
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.000
Right clip, match with the previous clip.

110
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.920
I'm going to choose my pelvis.

111
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.400
And since this starts to move pretty quickly and I want my feet to match, I'm going to

112
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.800
go ahead and match this with bone in previous clip and choose my left foot again.

113
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.840
Ball left, right up in here.

114
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.480
And you can see that little pop in place.

115
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480
That's kind of what I want.

116
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.900
Now it is still going to pop and we'll have to fix that.

117
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.560
There's some shifting that's probably on the root.

118
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.480
So let's go ahead and just make sure that we match up our end point in here.

119
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480
So same thing here.

120
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.040
Right click, match bone with previous clip.

121
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.240
And let's go ahead and choose the pelvis first.

122
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.760
That gets us in place.

123
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:21.000
And let's see what happens first if we match the previous clip with the foot again.

124
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So ball left.

125
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.440
And you can see that that's going to turn my character.

126
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.880
So unfortunately, that's not a good result.

127
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.520
I'm going to go ahead and choose this and let's match in here our bone with the previous

128
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.820
clip and just choose our pelvis again.

129
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.820
So this still lines up.

130
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.100
And since they're standing in almost the same position, it's going to be an okay clip for

131
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.100
blending.

132
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.380
Next is our blending options.

133
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.780
So we need to blend our animation tracks.

134
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.100
That's fairly easy.

135
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.540
So I'm just going to go ahead and hit the control button and drag across the top of

136
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.180
the timeline to zoom in on my blend sections.

137
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.580
And then I'm going to grab the next clip and smoosh that into the previous clip.

138
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580
About 10 frames.

139
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.820
You can see I'm at 75.

140
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.180
Let's move that down to about 65.

141
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.300
That's going to give us a nice long blend between the two.

142
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.300
Now to modify my blend, I can right click directly on it, move up into my options and

143
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.980
choose some easing options.

144
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.140
For this one, I'm going to go ahead and choose a quartic in and out.

145
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.300
Now that's going to give us a fairly decent blend.

146
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.820
And I'm just going to move down my timeline to the next section, which will be easily

147
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.860
seen because now I have a gap between them.

148
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.860
So I'm just going to go ahead and drag that down and same thing, 160 to 150.

149
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.940
Let's just shove that right in, giving myself a good 10 frame blend between the two.

150
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.940
And in this one, I'm going to go ahead and right click on my options for my easing and

151
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.460
adjust this one to a cubic in.

152
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.420
But I'm blending from here into this a little bit faster towards the end.

153
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.900
That's probably going to help out a little bit in the blend itself.

154
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.340
Now I could probably make this the opposite direction.

155
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.900
So let's go ahead and change this, go right up in here, go to options and let's do a quartic

156
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900
out.

157
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.700
And that'll be a little bit faster.

158
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.220
So we get down a little bit faster here.

159
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.280
I'm going to drag this on over.

160
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.620
We have a little bit of a bigger gap now.

161
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.660
And I actually have a subframe bleeding over in here.

162
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.020
So I'm going to clean this up just a little bit.

163
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.580
I'm going to grab my side step small and same thing.

164
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.460
I'm at 214.

165
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.460
I need enough space.

166
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.900
I'm going to go ahead and shove this down into 204.

167
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.060
And for this one, I'm going to keep this one pretty clean.

168
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.380
And you can see that this is my average option.

169
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.980
Rather than doing anything really different in here, I'm just go ahead and hit linear

170
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.180
and see what that looks like.

171
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.180
Yeah, so this is going to give me a pretty even change in here.

172
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.040
And that's going to work out just fine.

173
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.340
My feet slip a little bit, but that's okay.

174
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.900
I think I'll be able to fix that a little bit later.

175
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.900
Now I just want to drag all this out to the end.

176
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.100
And you can see that I have all this extra space.

177
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.100
If I move right to the end or type this in at 300, then I can right click, go into edit

178
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.100
and trim my section right.

179
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.900
That trims down my animation to fit within my timeline.

180
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.500
And that completes our animation assembly.

181
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.700
Now to make sure that my mannequin belongs to this level sequence, I'm going to go ahead

182
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.220
and right click it and convert this to a spawnable.

183
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.220
So now my level sequence is ready to have the inverse solved applied to it.

184
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.380
Okay, so let's jump back into our slides.

185
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:40.620
Okay, let's review everything we've just done inside Sequencer to create our animation

186
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.620
assembly.

187
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.100
The first step was placing the animated clips in the timeline.

188
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.020
We began by opening an animation assembly level sequence or creating a new animation

189
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.940
assembly level sequence to add our animation tracks to.

190
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.940
Then we chose any of the clips that were located in the Anim Clips folder.

191
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.740
Or if you used your own clips, we selected those and dragged them into the Sequencer

192
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.840
animation track to create our animation assembly.

193
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.800
We also deleted the control rig from the SK Mannequin actor inside Sequencer to prevent

194
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.580
that from getting in the way.

195
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.140
Next we applied bone matching.

196
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.140
And the first thing we did was right click on the animation track and check on the Blend

197
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.140
First Child of Root.

198
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.220
That blends the pelvis and was our first blending option to help match with all of our animations

199
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.140
based on their pelvis location.

200
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.620
Then to do more bone matching, we right clicked on the animation clip to bring up the clip's

201
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.940
properties.

202
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.540
We selected the Motion Blending option and matching the bone with either the previous

203
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.240
or next clip.

204
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.580
Then we selected the bone we wanted to use for matching.

205
00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:02.140
We switched a little bit between the root, pelvis, and ankle just to see how those looked.

206
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.180
The third step was blending our animation tracks.

207
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.620
To do this, we grabbed the next track in our sequence and smooshed it into the previous

208
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.920
track.

209
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.580
This created a little blend between the two.

210
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.100
To modify the blend, we right clicked directly on the Blend option.

211
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.980
That brought up our Properties and Options menu and from there we moved into the options

212
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.580
for easing and selected our preferred easing option.

213
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.020
We played with a few options to see how those looked and then chose whichever one we preferred

214
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.420
for our desired animation easing.

215
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.140
Doing this completed our animation assembly.

216
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.700
And that's it for this section of our hands-on animating and engine.

217
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.420
I hope you enjoyed creating your animation assembly and in our next section we will continue

218
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.720
our hands-on animation and engine by using that assembly in our exercise Applying the

219
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.740
Inverse Solve.
