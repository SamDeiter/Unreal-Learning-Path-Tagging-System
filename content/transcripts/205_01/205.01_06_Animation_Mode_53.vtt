00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Now, in this section of Sequencer's Features and Tools, we're going to explore the Animation

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.620
Mode toolset that is available when animating with Control Rig in Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.040
The first thing you will encounter when working in Animation Mode is the addition of two animation-specific

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.840
tabs, the Anim Outliner and the Anim Details panel.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.180
And just like the name suggests, these are animation-specific versions of the already

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.240
familiar Outliner and Details panels.

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.040
The Anim Outliner is designed to show the controls as organized by hierarchy in your

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.640
active Control Rig.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.520
Here, you can show or hide the Control Rig controls or quickly select a specific control

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.560
from the Outliner to make it an active selection in Sequencer.

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.240
The other tab is the Anim Details panel, which provides animators an isolated view of the

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.480
Euler Transform channels for the selected Control Rig control that they are manipulating.

13
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.020
The next set of Animation Mode tools are a series of animation buttons found in the

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.700
Animation tab when Animation Mode is active.

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.600
The first of those buttons is the Select button, and in general, I would just keep this button

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.680
enabled while animating a Control Rig.

17
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.240
When active, the Select button only allows users to select the Control Rig controls preventing

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.360
any accidental selections of things like the Scale Mesh, Actor, Geometry, random Static

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.320
Mesh props or set pieces, particle systems, lights, or cameras.

20
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.140
The next tool is the Poses button, which activates the Control Rig Pose window.

21
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.960
The Control Rig Pose window allows users to create and then share pose libraries for commonly

22
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.080
used character poses.

23
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.400
So for example, any kind of character-specific poses that must be frequently replicated across

24
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.960
multiple sequences, scenes, or shots can be created and stored in a shareable library.

25
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.180
Poses that add specific personality or quirks to a character's body mechanics can also be

26
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.940
shared and then applied to something like performance capture data to alter or exaggerate

27
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.540
that performance to fit the character's personality, allowing other members of the animation team

28
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.020
to take on some of the work, reducing the burden on the character animation leads.

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.380
The next set of tools we will talk about is the Snapper and Pivot buttons.

30
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.860
The Snapper button is used to define a parent and child relationship between a Control Rig

31
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.300
and an Influence Actor for creating keyframe animations on the Control Rig controls through

32
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.100
a temporary control attachment.

33
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.740
This can be very useful when implemented in specific scenarios where you want to have

34
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.420
an animated asset influence the position of the controls to generate synchronized keyframe

35
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.420
animations on the temporarily attached Control Rig control.

36
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.300
Just like the example shown here, where the parent, which is the bouncing static mesh

37
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.460
ball, is used to create keyframes on the child Control Rig IK Hand control.

38
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.700
Of course, additional polish animation will be needed to make this animation look better,

39
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.100
but it does provide animators a solid synchronized starting point, saving some animation time.

40
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100
The next button in our toolset is the Pivot button, and just like the name suggests here,

41
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.420
the Pivot button does exactly what it says it will do, allowing an animator to adjust

42
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.300
the pivot point, creating an offset for the Control Rig controls.

43
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.500
Finally, there are just two remaining animation tools that need to be discussed, the Trails

44
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.320
button and the Tweens button.

45
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.520
The Trails button serves two functions.

46
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.640
The first is going to help you with visualization of the animation path in the viewport.

47
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.960
Motion trails can be visualized and information related to that path can be added or subtracted

48
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.240
depending on the user needs.

49
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.440
The second function is direct manipulation of the motion trail inside the viewport.

50
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.280
Motion trails can be moved or modified, allowing an animator to perfect those arcs and look

51
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.860
for any bumps or unnatural motions that might not be obvious.

52
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.300
One thing to note, the Trails button can make curve manipulation easy, but they are

53
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.220
very processor intensive, so be careful.

54
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.540
Users will need something pretty powerful hardware wise to make the curve manipulation

55
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.820
run smoothly.

56
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.500
Lastly, we have the Tweens button, which is used to adjust the interpolation between keyframes

57
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.740
using three preset tween modes.

58
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.020
The tween modes are the BN mode, which blends keys to the nearest neighbor.

59
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.940
The PP mode, which push and pulls curves between the selected keyframes.

60
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.900
And the TW mode, which tweens the selected keyframes.

61
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.220
Alright, that's it for Sequencers features and tools.

62
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.420
In our next section, we will jump right into some hands-on animating and engine, beginning

63
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.900
with laying the groundwork by building our first animation assembly.
