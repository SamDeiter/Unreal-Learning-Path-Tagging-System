  "text": " Here are a few basic reminders as to why you need data preparation. Unlike when you're working in games where you build assets one at a time, when your goal is manufacturing, it often means that your project or design is most likely already fully assembled and arranged in a certain fashion. In that respect, you may have hundreds or thousands of objects already set up in your CAD application, that you need to import into Unreal in a meaningful way, preserving hierarchies and pivot points. This is where Datasmith excels. Your existing pipeline may include DCC software that require a dedicated plugin to export to Datasmith, which you can download from the Unreal Engine website. But if you are using CAD applications like Solidworks or KTIA to name a couple, then these files will be read natively by Datasmith and you do not need to convert them. Let's take a look at importing a Datasmith file into Unreal Engine to get a feel for that procedure, and then we'll talk about how the information is processed. By this time, you should have downloaded and extracted the project files that have been provided to you. Find a project file named smvisualdataprep.u project and launch it. It opens up in Unreal Engine and the Content Browser has a set of subfolders in it. We'll take a quick look at basic Datasmith ingestion and then proceed to learn about automation. Start a new level and remove unnecessary actors from the scene such as the Shader Ball and the two lines of text. Create a folder in the Content Browser named MyDS. To import a Datasmith file, use the Datasmith button on the main toolbar. Keep in mind this button may or may not be available by default based on the template you chose to start your project. If the option doesn't appear on the main toolbar, then you need to enable it in the Plugins dialog. Typically, you enable the Datasmith Importer option to accommodate DCC applications, and the Datasmith CAD Importer to accommodate CAD applications, but there are a few additional options to choose from. There's a Datasmith plugin for Cinema 4D users, another for VRED and DeltaGen. There's even a plugin for the open-source GLTF format, which is a plugin for the Open Source. There's also a plugin for the Open Source GLTF format that helps those whose DCC application doesn't export to Datasmith. Autodesk Maya comes to mind. You will need to restart the engine after such changes but in this case, we're good to go. Using the Datasmith button, browse to select the file go-cart.3dm under Assets, CAD files, Rhino, GoCart. For a location to store the file, select the MyDS folder you just created and proceed from there. Next, you are asked to select the type of information you wish to import. This particular file has no lights, cameras or animations in it, so you can disable these options. You can also adjust tessellation options in this dialog to control the conversion of NURP surfaces into triangulated geometry. But this globally affects all imported parts. Leave these to their default settings for now. Later, you'll learn how to use them on select parts. Click Import to bring in the model. Reset the position of the floor to drop it down a notch, and consider hiding the grid to prevent screen flickering. The information is now inside of Unreal Engine and neatly organized in categories in the Content Browser. Note the little stars on the thumbnails, an indication that even though it was imported, the data is not saved yet. Click the Save All button in the Content Browser to remedy that. If your level is not saved yet, you'll be asked to give it a name. Call it MyCart after you've created the Maps folder for it. The data is now in the engine and you can start adjusting it. For example, you could consider re-tessellating a few parts. Set the camera speed lower and investigate the tires, and the tubular chassis parts, or even the steering wheel for that matter. You'll notice they all could use some help. Let's start with the tires. They're instances and are based on a single static mesh. You can see that by selecting one and then use the magnifier icon in the Details panel to show the parent static mesh. You can see that by selecting one and then use the magnifier icon in the Details panel to show the parent static mesh. One size fits all. Double-click the tire static mesh to open it in the Static Mesh Editor. Go into the Mesh Editing tab and enter Edit Mode. This is just so that you can see the mesh details a little better. In fact, you can even consider displaying the information in Lighting Only mode. To re-tessellate this part, use the Asset Re-tessellate action from the menu. Expand the panel, and you can adjust the values to increase detail. Try a Core Tolerance of 0.05, a maximum edge length of 2, and leave the Normal Tolerance at 20. These parameters are covered in more detail in the 106.02 data estimated ingestion class. Click Tessellate to bring about the necessary changes to the static mesh, which now looks much more detailed. Save the information, and close the Static Mesh Editor. The tires now look much better, but of course, you'd need to do this for each and every other part as well, like the wheels on the car, these jagged looking tubes that make the chassis, the steering wheel and so on. Of course, if the goal was to use the same tessellation values for all meshes, then you could have adjusted the tessellation values at import time. That process would have been global. But if you're planning different tessellation values for different meshes or groups of meshes, then you need to deal with those individually in the Static Mesh Editor. You might need to consider creating LODs for the various parts, and that is also done one static mesh at a time. So this would require another trip to the Static Mesh Editor to set LODs manually or by LOD group. That's not a hard task per se, just time consuming if you have many static meshes in your project. Finally, you may need to look into replacing incoming materials with better ones that you might have in your PBR library. Again, not a hard task, but one that would take time. In this case, it is easy enough to select all the chassis parts that are neatly organized in the Outliner, and replace their material in one sweep. Also keep in mind that this particular example is a simple one with only a few meshes and materials to consider, and yet you can appreciate the nature of the repetitive tasks awaiting you. So you can extrapolate and guess how time consuming a larger project might be. And so let's take a look at how we can automate these tasks. We'll first take a look at Python scripting, and then move on to the Visual Data Prep tool. Click the Save All button to save the project before moving on.",
