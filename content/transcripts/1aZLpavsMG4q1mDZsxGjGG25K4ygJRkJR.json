  "text": " Hello and welcome to this first video where we're going to be looking at behavior trees. Now when we're working with behavior trees, we're going to be working with a whole load of new classes. And I think it's useful for us to kind of compare these classes to what an actual sort of human would have at any one point. Because with AI what we're looking to do is mimic a sort of form of intelligence so that we can control the NPCs or the non-playing characters within whatever game we're working on. So the first of these classes would be the behavior tree itself. Now the behavior tree can be thought of as the brain. It is a visual way of organizing the sequence of tasks and their dependencies. So this is going to be how we alternate the thinking. So you can think of that as the brain. Next up we have something that's called the blackboard. And this is directly connected to the behavior tree, but this functions as its memory. We're going to be loading data in and out of the blackboard and using it to make our decisions. Now the next thing that we have is a task. Now a task is a action. So this is something that we're going to be asking something to be done that can be placed within a behavior tree. This is a bit like a function when you something that you call within a pawn or something. However, it is an active class in itself, therefore acting to be quite modular. So we can repeat them and use them in different ways against different pawns. Next up we have is a decorator. And this is going to act a bit like a filter or a sort of decision maker. So when you look at behavior trees, and we're going to quickly look at how a decorator might work. This is going to prevent us from doing certain paths or actions. But I always think of it as a filter. Next up we have a service. And what a service will do is it will regularly check certain conditions. And these can be saved out as variables or saved to the blackboard. But it functions as a checker. So it's constantly just checking that something is true or of a certain value. Now, before we jump into the project and have a look at the behavior trees, I wanted to show you a couple of animations so that we can get a kind of visual idea of how the behavior tree works. So as you can see here, we have a whole load of different nodes all connected up. Tasks, decorators, sequences and services. Now, when the AI starts off, it's going to always start at the root here at the top. And it's then going to follow down through the leftmost path. And depending on if you've got a selector or a sequence, it's going to action the tasks accordingly. Now, we talked about decorators and we described them as a kind of filters. Well, you can see here when we jump into the second graph, if the decorator was going to filter or gate off this different path, it's going to mark this entire path as a failed path. And because we're using a selector at this point, it's going to go on and it's going to use this path on the right hand side. So this is just sort of a very quick visual interpretation of the order of how the different nodes are going to be followed from a behavior tree. Now, we're going to build something like this through the exercise. So you're going to get quite accustomed to it, but it's just nice at the beginning to be able to see this sort of visually how this is going to update. So that's what we're going to cover for theory about behavior trees to start with. In the next video, we're going to be jumping into the engine and setting one of these up from scratch.",
