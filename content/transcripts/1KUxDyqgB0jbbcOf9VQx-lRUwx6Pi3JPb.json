  "text": " In this section of our video tutorial, we're going to have a really quick look at the editor UI, as well as how we navigate the editor and work with various actors. Let's go ahead and start this off by first taking a look at the Unreal Engine 5 user interface. Now, across the top here at 1, we have our File Menu bar. And this is going to be the same throughout the entire editor. And here you can do things like making, opening, and saving level data. You can edit current project settings for both the editor and your project. You can display and open different tools in editor. You can also find help with the final building of a project's data and get quick reference to documentation and API. Who is going to be our main toolbar? Options here include creating and adding new types of content for actors to levels, accessing the content browser or third party content providers, accessing the level blueprint or any blueprints that are used in this project, managing your level or your project's cinematics. And there's even options to activate different editing modes, such as landscape, foliage, mesh paint, mesh fracture, and many others. We're also going to find our PIE or our Play and Editor options here. And one thing to note, too, with our Play and Editor options, make sure you click on these three little dots here to expose further functionality. We then have our platform dropdown, which allows us to build this for various platforms we might be developing for. And then settings over here allows us to access various settings for the performance that we're seeing inside of the editor in real time. Now three, which is in the middle, this is the level viewport. And this is where you're going to be spending a majority of your time. From here, you can do things like interact and add items to your levels. You can view different debug modes to help hard to find issues. You can adjust the grid size, rotation, and snapping settings. And you can even change the viewport options to help you look at your world in different views to help you either find bugs or make better artistic decisions. Over here in four, we have our tab drawer system. Now by default, this is going to contain the details panel and the outliner, but you can add other windows to this. Now the outliner is going to show you things that are placed inside of your level. And the details panel is actually a context-sensitive panel that will change its information based off of what you have selected. So if I have a actor selected versus a light, the details panel will show me different information based off of that. Over here under five, we have our content drawer. This can be accessed by clicking on this or pressing Control Spacebar on your keyboard. If you're new to Unreal Engine 5 or a previous user of Unreal Engine, this is going to be something that might be a little bit new. Normally, the content browser is docked right here. And while you can still dock the content browser there, by default, it has been removed down to the content drawer, which again can be accessed by either clicking on this button or hitting Control Space. Last but not least, we have the console input. Inside of here, you can input various commands and see those commands reflected in the editor viewport. The commands that you import here can range from anything from debug commands to enable certain types of rendering options or even commands to help reduce or increase performance features. One thing that makes this console commands very useful is if you type in the word help and you press Enter, in your default browser, you will be displayed a list of all of the console commands that are available and a little rundown about how they can be used in your project.",
