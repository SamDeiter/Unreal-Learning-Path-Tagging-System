  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a quick look at profiling and some of the tools that you have at your disposal. I do want to make a note though that we do have a deeper dive of these topics in our optimization courses. Feel free to take those. Just a reminder, this is just going to be a quick take, a surface level overview. Let's get started. To be able to quickly analyze your scene and look at in these stalls might be happening, you can actually in your console command, your output log, you can actually go in here and type in profile GPU or stat GPU. These will both give you a quick look at what's going on and if there are some millisecond hold-ups as you move your camera around. Now, stat GPU will give you a real-time as you position your camera around. Now, profile GPU is just going to give you a quick profile, like a snapshot. For deeper dive, you want to look at session front-end or Unreal Insights. Let's briefly look at these. Again, this is a surface level look at things and the tools you have at your command. I do want to encourage you to take those other classes if you want to get a deeper dive of these tools. In Unreal, I just have a simple scene here. It's got some alien probes and a beach here. What we're going to do is actually take a look at some things. I'll show you some of the tools that you have at your fingertips. An old-school tool we have is session front-end. Now, he's been around for a bit. This allows you to actually select what you want to run a quick test. I'm going to leave out audio in this case, and I can go ahead and run that test. It'll ask me to save selected. We'll say, save, sure. This actually helps it so that it just parses the data and has it to rely on. You'll see it now analyze and check for any errors that are going on. At any time, I can stop this test and go back to it if I need to. You'll notice you also have a currently loaded editor in the test map. Click this to select the test and run it immediately. That's just your quick button for it. There's a refresh. There's also grouping control. There's console here. We can actually analyze things a bit better, and there's also screen comparison. You do want to make sure you have this guy selected when you're doing this. Now, older versions of this, I actually preferred where you can just say, hey, collect data based on your selection here. But that interface doesn't quite always pop up and just be warned, this is a little bit of a tool that's slowly being deprecated. But for the most part, it's still available for those that are used to it, and it works okay. I'm going to go and close this one for now. We're now going to go and take a look at our Unreal Insights. That's found down here now. Now, you may have got it in the past underneath tools or Windows, but you want to be able to grab it here now. I'm going to open up the Unreal Insights session browser. Now, there's quick ways where you can actually grab some current or some recent traces that you did. But for now, I'm just going to click on Unreal Insights. So Unreal Insights is ready to go. Underneath connection, I can say, hey, let's connect to what we have. You'll see our connect is successful. So you can choose the IP that you want to send this to. So it's now doing an active trace. So if I want to stop this trace, I'm going to go to my output log, and I'm going to click the up arrow. And that's going to say trace stop. And it says trace dot stop. Now, just make note of that. Now that it's stopped, I can go back into here and double click on the trace that we just did. This is going to analyze my scene and show me in milliseconds what is the holdup. Is it my fog? Are the effects? Is my water giving me trouble? And I do recommend maybe moving the camera around to get a better idea of how things are being analyzed. And you can do a comparison when my camera was here. This is where the holdup was when my camera was here. Ah, this doesn't hold up things anymore. So that's a good way to do things. I just kept my camera static in this particular case. You'll see there's a filter for GPU and CPU. You can also see that you can zoom in and zoom out and you can isolate data if you need to. That actually is pretty helpful. You also can turn off your frames, your timing, and you can look at things quickly and easily this way. So this gives you a really good idea of where things are at. But let me emphasize what you're looking for because that's the big thing that people run into when they look at this. What am I looking for? You're looking for stalls in your milliseconds. You're looking for where things are being held up. Is it my lights? Is it my water? Is it my fog? You can actually see in milliseconds what exactly could be the issue. And this is really up to you to analyze this and think about what it is that you need and if there's a performance cost, where that hit is at. Now notice up here I am wheel mouse going, zooming in on the items to be able to see where the processes are held up. Well, that's about it for this session that will wrap things up. Let's go ahead and do an overview of what we've learned and that's about it.",
