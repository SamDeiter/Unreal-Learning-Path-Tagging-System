  "text": " Pivot points can get frustrating if not handled properly. When you're working on an asset in your DCC application, you want to keep it close to the center of the world. In fact, you typically want to center it to the 0,0,0 coordinates because that point becomes the pivot point around which the asset will rotate or scale in Unreal Engine. The forklift shown here has an offset pivot point relative to the mesh. You can imagine how it would behave if you rotated it at this point. That is not predictable behavior. I could use the DCC app's tools to center the pivot point to the object, and possibly make further adjustments to place it between the wheels. And while this may fix the problem inside the DCC app, it is not enough to ensure the correct pivot point's placement during the FBX transfer. The object needs to be centered to the world to ensure proper behavior. Let's test it out in Unreal. Go ahead and create a new level. Enter the file named forklift-pivot-good.fbx into it. Make sure you reset the FBX import defaults. This represents the asset we just signed 3ds Max with the pivot point centered to the object and the model set to 0,0,0. Drag the asset into the level. The behavior is predictable with the placement hand icon seemingly anchored to the pivot point. Next, try the same with the pivot-bad FBX file. For your information, this file was saved in the DCC app with the pivot point centered on the model but with the mesh offset from the center of the world. This means it behaves properly in the DCC app but the pivot is relocated to 0,0,0 at import time in UE5. This time, even as you hover trying to place the actor in the level, you can feel something is wrong. The anchor point seems to be off and we're having a hard time with the model. This is something to keep in mind as you create and export your 3D models. You can force the import process to take the offset from 0,0,0 into account. Here's how. Delete the actors and the assets from the Content Browser. And re-import the pivot-bad file which we know isn't working correctly. Before you click the Import button, expand the Advanced Mesh section and disable the Transform Vertex to Absolute and Enable Big Pivot in Vertex. Try and place the forklift now and note that the position of the pivot point is indeed the correct one. If all else fails, you can relocate the pivot point inside Unreal Engine. It is usually recommended you do so in your DCC application and then re-import the file, but if you choose to, you can make this correction directly inside UE5. Again, delete the actor and the assets and re-import the pivot-bad file. Make sure you reset the defaults before clicking the Import button. Place the model in the scene, we're back to the weird behavior. With the actor selected, switch the mode to Modeling. This gives you a plethora of modeling tools to choose from but for now, we're only interested in relocating the pivot point. This can be done through the Xform panel under Edit Pivot. You can readjust the pivot location manually or use one of the presets. In this case, the bottom preset works really well. Accept the changes and test the results. What's more, this edit works on the asset level, which means that the next actor you place in the scene will behave appropriately as well. Here's the warning though. The changes you made will be lost if and when you decide to re-import the FBX file. If you make a change to your geometry in your DCCE app and re-import the file, the pivot will relocate to the position defined in the FBX file and has the potential to mess up your scene again. This is why it's best that the pivot point is properly placed in the DCCE app prior to exporting. Switch back to selection mode and save your project before moving on.",
