  "text": " The Content Browser is an extremely powerful tool for managing all the content that you'll find in any of your Unreal Engine 5 projects. Not only can you use the Content Browser to import content and manage content, you can also do advanced searches, as well as get detailed information about your assets right from within the Content Browser itself. So let's go ahead and pop over to the Engine and take a look at this in more detail. Now to access the Content Browser, there's two different ways. We can come down here and go to the Content Drawer, which is going to open it up. And if you don't want to keep doing that, you can press this Dock in Layout, which is actually going to dock this right here. The other way we can do this is by hitting Control Space, and that is going to bring up this Content Browser and the active window that we have. For now, I'm just going to click on this Dock in Layout so that we can look at this in a little more detail. So over here on the left-hand side, we have our Add. This is where we're going to do things like import or add features or content packs or add things from Quixel or Fab. We can also create new folders. And then you're going to see a bunch of different things here for creating basic assets. Now, whenever we want to create something inside of Unreal, like a blueprint or a material, we do that by either coming here and looking for the appropriate one up here to create basic assets. Or if we need something a little bit more advanced, under the Create Advanced Assets, you're going to see a lot of different options down here. So what you see is not up here. It's probably down here. And the other way we can do this also is just by right-clicking inside of the Content Browser while accessing the same menu. We then have a Favorites, which allows us to favorite certain assets that we use quite a bit. And then we have our Folder Structure that allows us to look at all of the folders that we have. And we can also right-click in here and do something like a new folder. Or should we want to do something like that? As we go a little bit further on, we have our Import, which allows us to import, save all. This is going to save everything that you have edited inside of the Content Browser, but it does not save your level. So if we want to save our level, we click here. This saves the level. This will save actually all the modified assets. We then have a little navigation here. And this is a menu bar that lets us know where we're currently at in the Folder Structure. Then we have our Settings. So our Settings are pretty cool because they allow us to do a couple of different things. So first off, under the View Type, we can change this to things like Lists or Columns. And the cool thing about this is, let's just find some stuff here. When we're at Columns, you can see here what I get is a bunch of different information. And this is really cool because this can help me make better decisions about what I am currently looking at in terms of maybe some optimization. So here we go. If I click on the cloth one, I can sort these by my vertices or triangles to get a better idea of what is going on with them. I'm going to click this back over to Tiles. And I'm also going to come over here now and I want to show you this Show Engine Content. So I'm going to click that on. And what that's going to do is you're not going to see anything really different, but we are going to get our Engine folder here. And you might need to enable this sometimes if you want to access stuff that's inside of a plugin. Or maybe you need to access some content inside of the Engine to make something that is always loading or something like that. That's how you can actually see that by coming up here again and doing the Show Engine Content. If not, then you won't be able to see that. A couple of other things to note here. Thumbnail Size, Thumbnail Edit Mode, and Real-Time Thumbnails. These are great if you are trying to. Let me just click back here and go to like this right here. If I go to my Thumbnail Edit Mode, I can kind of drag this thumbnail around. Whoops, I wasn't on the thumbnail. There we go. I can drag this around and move it. And then when I'm done here, I can just press, you know, Done Editing and that will save those changes. So if I ever need to adjust this. Now, Unreal does a really great job of giving you thumbnails automatically. So, you know, you might not need to do that. But in case you do, that option is there. There is also an extremely powerful search and filter. So I'm just going to just reset the filters really quick. So if you want to search, we can be very powerful so I can do like underscore N or let me just click on the content folder right here. And we'll do something like dirt. And there we go. There's the only dirt that I have right there. It looks like it's only in the content examples. One of the other cool things that we can do with the search and I'm just going to paste this into here is we can make these very complex operands to check for items of certain sizes or certain properties. So in this example, what I'm doing here is I'm looking for triangles less than or equal to ten thousand five hundred. So things that are going to have more than ten thousand five hundred triangles. That's what I'm looking for. And this will spit them all out for me. So the search is extraordinarily powerful. The other thing is the filter. So if we click on this little arrow right here, we get a list of filters. So I generally run with like my textures and my static meshes on probably my materials and maybe my material instances. But our filters allow us to filter by whatever we have. And then we can do something like let's look for underscore N maybe check out all of the normal maps that we have. So, again, very, very powerful features inside of the content browser and something that you're going to be utilizing quite a bit inside of your project, especially as everything that you want to import is going to be imported into here and everything that you want to create in the editor is going to be created from the content browser menu and then utilized as you need.",
