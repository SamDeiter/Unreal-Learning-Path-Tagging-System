  "text": " Alright, let's take this from the top. So where are you right now? Well typically, you are here. Working within a production that will usually follow a waterfall type workflow that starts with some storyboards created from the script or story beats and then from there it might move into some basic modeling. Maybe start doing some layout for sets, work in some basic staging, and then move into performance capture or animation before doing a couple of lighting passes and then when all that is done, you'll render everything out for editing and post. Generally, this utilizes the following traditional production pillars that remain departmentalized within their various silos and most animation studios will still use and maintain these silos as a means to control their workforce, hire specialists, and regulate their production schedule. But they take tremendous resources to sustain and can be pretty rigid when it comes to changes. So none of these things really goes away. Instead, the core production pillars just need to change how they work together to be better synchronized in terms of execution. Now if we look at this simplified overview of the typical animation studio pipeline, the current workflow usually begins with story development. That's where the story department and storyboards start charting the course for the project with the main beats of the story. This lays down the track for the production train to follow, but in this way you really can't move ahead in production without these core elements being nailed down for the other departments to follow. Once the story department lays the track, then production design and asset construction can move full steam ahead. This is where the modeling, rigging, and surfacing, or texturing happens, along with figuring out all the technical requirements involved in creating the scene assemblies. From there, production goes into creating rough layouts and generally chugs along to compose all of the scenes for the project before animation and layout send shots and scenes back and forth until the final layout is completed. After that, everything is transferred over to the shot enhancement track, and you might start doing more shot-specific work for things like lighting, character, or camera effects, crowds, simulations, and creating mats for composite. Finally, when all that's finished, you're ready to start image output. Of course, the lighting and editorial teams have probably been working through comps during the entire process, but now all the elements should start to come together to get that final edit completed. So as we just saw through the pipeline example, the strengths and weaknesses to this approach become pretty apparent in the traditional CG animation pipeline, as it's a very front-loaded story process that almost requires the project teams to figure out all the main story beats before anyone can do anything else. This creates those very silo-centric publishing requirements, and that in turn forces the editorial and layout departments to step in and serve as the main production hub, leaving principal creatives to be governed by the results of pre-production once all of the elements are in place, making that the only way to know where everything else is going. This means there is potentially less interactivity between departments, and that can result in a rather labor-intensive revision process. And sure, you can still do things like dailies. That doesn't change. But in the traditional pipeline, it's less tactile. And once a shot is near completion and the layered renders are getting composited for final output, it's not that easy to see the finished result and then suddenly decide your fill light needs to move 3 meters to the left, or a character's hand position that looked great until effects were added now needs to move 10 centimeters to the right to be seen clearly. At that point, the artist would have to go back, make edits, and then re-export the shot through the entire pipeline. And on top of that, limited cross-development or even cross-studio compatibility if you have partners or more locations can create an even slower iteration process than what you might get when working in real time. So where does that leave us? Well, in the next section, I'm going to show you right where you need to be.",
