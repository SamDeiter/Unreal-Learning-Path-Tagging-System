  "text": " When dealing with FBX imports into Unreal, you're typically dealing with static meshes, but we ought to mention skeletal meshes as well. A skeletal mesh is made of two parts, a visual piece of geometry that is skinned onto a bone hierarchical structure. As the bones are animated, the vertices on the geometry deform accordingly. When you import an FBX file that has a skeletal mesh, Unreal picks up on that and ensures it brings in the mesh, the bone skeleton and all its hierarchy, and any associated materials and textures. Let's try it out using the Gaunt FBX file. Simply create a folder for it and drag the FBX file into it. As the FBX import dialog shows up, you'll notice a few additional options to those you are used to in the Mesh section. The importer picks up the information in the FBX file and knows it is now dealing with a skeletal mesh, not a static one. If you were to disable the Skeletal Mesh option, the geometry would then be imported as static and you would lose all skinning information. You wouldn't want that. If you are only planning to import animations stored in the FBX file, then you can disable the Import Mesh option. That's not the case here. If you already have a skeleton in your scene and you want to use it, then you can select it from the Skeleton drop-down list, but we won't do that at this time. In the Animation section, ensure the Import Animations option is enabled and the skeleton is selected. In the Animation section, ensure the Import Animations option is enabled even though this Gaunt character isn't animated yet. This will create an animation asset, which will be in place already when you decide to import animations for this skeleton. Otherwise, you would need to create one manually. Click Import when done. Aside from materials and textures, four more assets were created. The one with the purple bar is the mesh itself, so you can go ahead and add it to the scene. The other three assets cater for animation, physics and the bone skeleton hierarchy. If you double-click the mesh asset, you get into an editor a bit reminiscent of the Static Mesh Editor, where you can view and edit material assignments, LODs and other options. You could open other editors for other assets the same way, by double-clicking their thumbnails in the Content Browser, but you can also switch from one editor to the next using the buttons in the top right corner. The Skeleton Editor shows you the bone structure definition. The Physics Editor shows the physics objects wrapping the various limbs. And the Animation Editor lets you view the various animations including in this project. Except we don't have any animations just yet. We only imported the bone skeleton and skin mesh so far. Back to the main editor, let's import a few animations. Select all the other FBX files in the Gaunt folder and drag them into the Content Browser. These files only contain animation information and no meshes. That's why the Mesh option isn't displayed in the FBX import dialog. It did pick up the gaunt skeleton in the scene and therefore these animations will be available for that skeleton. Simply click the Import All button to import all animations. If you open the Animation asset once more, you'll notice the new animation files listed in the asset browser. Double-click on them to preview them in the editor. Some are creepy and work well for a zombie character. Others are a bit silly but comical nonetheless. You may be wondering how to put all these together and animate your character at gameplay but that's for another class. This was more to show you how to import your skeleton meshes and animations into the engine. Thanks for watching!",
