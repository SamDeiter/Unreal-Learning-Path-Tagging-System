  "text": " And to actually get into some of the specific classes here, let's look at the kind of overview of these six core components at the top in pink, and then maybe some multiplayer networks ready classes that are below. That's not to say that they're specifically designed for anything networked in this instance, but it's good to be aware of these moving forward. So thinking about a pawn, a pawn is the base class for any actor that can be controlled by the player or AI. So you may be thinking about pawn and character if you do have familiarity with Unreal Engine, that they're very similar in nature, and you'd be right in thinking that. The pawn specifically provides the capabilities which the controller chooses what to use and when. So you can possess a pawn, you can control a pawn, but the main difference between a pawn and a character is that a character is a very specific type of pawn that it can still walk, run, jump and fly, it can do all the movement behavior, but the character takes some of the heavy lifting for you and applies it. So you may have a skeletal mesh component added to the character, and a collision capsule, and some of the things that the pawn by default may not want. The pawn is like the higher level class. So, you know, it could be a vehicle, it could be a character, it could be a AI based component. So the character takes a lot of what the pawn does and gives you some good defaults to work with. So a lot of times you may just go straight to character, which would be fine to do, but I just wanted to differentiate between pawn and character here, just to give you the high level overview. Whereas the controller is something very different. The controller, think about the controller, almost like the brain for the pawn and the characters. So a player controller is used by the player to control the pawn or the character, and you can receive input from the controller to control a pawn or a character. This is why I say it's almost like a brain. So the controller will be the thing controlling the pawn or the character. The controller is spawned at runtime, and not all pawns would need controllers by any means, because, you know, like I said, it might be an AI entity or a vehicle or something like this. But as we get into the player controller, you'll see where this becomes a little bit different with actually possessing pawns and characters. So as we look at the player controller, the player controller is receiving input from the human player controlling it. So it's almost like a specialized controller. It represents a human player locally in the game, and it's a central place to handle the input and the player view. So you can, again, then use that to provide input to maybe your character. So if you have a player controller and a character, you might assign that controller to the character, again, almost like acting like the brain or something like this, to then move that character around. It's also worth noting that you would need a controller, you know, when I say it's like the brain, you would need a controller for a pawn that is an AI entity, for example. The AI entity doesn't, you know, it's just almost like a meat sack if you think about it, without the brain, the pawn will just be there and it'll exist in the world, but it won't know how to navigate the world. Again, if it's an AI entity, you need to add a controller to a pawn to make that aware of the navigation and anything that it needs to react with in gameplay. So hopefully that gives you a nice overview of what the relationship between pawn and character is. Again, pawn is a higher level entity and then character takes some of these assumptions that they think you might just wanna put into a character. And so more often than not, you might just wanna start with a character class. And then thinking about controllers in general and also player controllers is a helpful kind of way to differentiate all this. Whereas the game mode, it gets into something a little bit different here. So the game mode is a primary class that specifies what other classes are used in the game play. So you only have one game mode per level. You control the game mode via the world settings. So if you're unsure where the world settings are, if you just open your editor, go to window and select world settings. You might already have this open as a docked window, but that's where you'll set your game mode. And when you set your game mode, you'll see that it has other classes that it wants to specify. Think about the game mode, almost like a wrapper for your other things. So you might set the game mode and within the game mode, you might wanna say, okay, what kind of character do I have? What kind of controller do I have? What kind of hood do I have? And it kind of provides these commonly used gameplay framework classes to kind of wrap everything into a single game type. And this will then be used for rules of the game, maybe making a catch the flag game or something like this. This will then define what type of gameplay you have in this level. And again, you've got one per level on the game mode side. The game instance actually persists across levels, which is really useful to think about. So if you're going from level one to level two and you have 10 gold coins in level one, and then you want to go into level two, but if you just loaded level two and you had your coins stored on the first level, level two would forget about those game coins. Whereas having a game instance, now because it persists across levels, it allows you to actually save some information in there, such as gold coins or lives of the player or something like this, and that'll then persist. So the game instance is only ever one spawned at runtime, but it also persists across multiple levels. So this is really useful to think about. And it's worth noting the game instance just can't be deleted or replaced at runtime. There's one game, as soon as you hit play in your editor, the game instance spawns, and you've only got that one game instance across levels. So just keep that in mind. Now we highlighted some of these in blue because they can be associated with networked or replicated versions of the game mode. So just keep that in mind, but essentially the game state contains data and logic relevant to all the players in the game. Might hold your team scores or objectives or anything that you might need for networked multiplayer game. So the game mode is only present on the server in a networked multiplayer context. So that's worth keeping in mind there. And then the player state. So if we had the game state, now we have the individual player state, and that just handles the data and logic relevant to the associated player. So it might hold your health and your ammo count. And again, it primarily exists to be leveraged in the networked multiplayer. So if you're just making a non-networked game, you could use the game instance to store some of this information, and that would be completely fine. So the information on the player state, it can just exist locally, but also on the server as well. So just keep this kind of framework in mind as you're picking which states to use. And the HUD, this is less used now. So you may not use the HUD class as much. The HUD is the base object for displaying elements on the screen. And any human controlled player, which is assigned through the game mode, like I said, so to up from HUD, we have game mode. We actually do store the HUD on the game mode. But yeah, like I said, it is often replaced with something called UMG widgets, which UMG stands for Unreal Motion Graphics, if you want to explore that topic further. And it allows you to create HUD elements, which you could store on the player character or even on the level. So HUD is less used, and it can be difficult to leverage for anything more complicated on modular. But the class exists there, it's worth knowing about, but maybe you'll get less utilization from this. And similarly with the camera, the camera represents the player's point of view or how the player sees the world. So cameras only really have the relevance to the human control players. And we can actually add cameras to the character, for example. So a character blueprint by default will come with a camera component. So the camera class doesn't necessarily have to be used. It's worth noting though, the actors can have multiple cameras. So if you have your character and you want to add a camera component to that character, you could have a third person camera attached to that and a first person and a top down all in the same character. So the player view isn't constrained to just the pawn that they have currently possessed. It can be, your view can be assigned to anywhere in the game that has a camera component. The camera is connected via the controller. So if you're ever trying to set the view of a character, you have to do that via the controller. So this is a lot to get into. I don't wanna overwhelm you too much, but say you had a character in a level and we know that that character has a controller because we said the controller is the brain that controls the character. So the controller needs to receive input. So say you want to assign a new camera to the character, maybe you have a fixed camera game and maybe you have a camera in the corner of the room or something. You have to get the player controller first to then set the new camera target rather than going directly through the character. So it's worth keeping that stuff in mind. And we'll get into examples in the workshop of all of these classes. And just wanted to give you a very, very high level overview of what each class does and what situation it might be used in. Again, the theory is fine if you don't have it all completely locked down because when you get up and running Unreal, Unreal does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. But for those people that wanna know a little bit more about what the classes and the frameworks mean, hopefully that has been helpful for you. So it's also worth noting that there are two classes that technically aren't part of the gameplay framework, but it's very useful to know about. So we mentioned the world settings in the previous slide. And what we haven't touched upon is a level blueprint as well. So starting with the world settings, just because we mentioned that on the previous slide, the world settings panel is where we can set an override level specific settings. So each level has its own world settings and you can use the panel to set your game mode like the example that we used in the previous slide. We said that the game mode has to be set in the world settings, but also the world settings hold global illumination values. So the world settings is technically working like an actor, although you don't get access to it at runtime. The base class used for the world settings can be set through project settings, but then it would apply globally across your entire game. So again, just think about the world settings as being used to define the game mode for a specific level, but it's only relevant to that persistent level. And we'll get into persistent and non-persistent levels in a little while. Whereas the level blueprint is, it's almost like a specialized type of blueprint that acts on the level itself. So each level that you have will have its own blueprint connected with it. And again, level blueprints are technically type of actor, but they are connected directly to the level that you are currently working on. So why would I use a level blueprint? So what we try to recommend is using blueprints to create logic is a great way to go. And you can create blueprints from your content browser and bring them into your map. And generally speaking, it's best to do the majority of your scripting in the blueprints in the content browser, and then drag them in, rather than scripting on your level blueprint. Now, why is this? So if I made a door, and I made the door open and close when the player gets to it, but I had this door on the level blueprint, for example, the door would still work fine, and that's great. But if I changed levels, now that door is on the previous level that I was just working on. And now I don't have access to that door that open and closes. So of course I can make that second door open and close again, but I may have to copy and paste the values. I may have to make sure everything's right. But what if I changed the timing of that door? Now on level one, the timing would be different on level two, and you just get inconsistency, and it's repetitive work and unnecessary. And say you had a bug in the door on level one, well, then you'd have to go and fix it in level two, and it just gets a bit repetitive, doesn't it? So you might create that door blueprint in your content browser and drag out that door into the world. And therefore you have one door to rule them all. And if you need to make changes, you can change it on the content browser version, the blueprint. And of course each blueprint would be instant, so you can make small tweaks to each door. That's a good workflow to work with. So generally you wouldn't want to script on the level blueprint for something like that. But if there is definitely just some level specific logic that you need to script, that level blueprint is there to add some level specific behavior if needed.",
