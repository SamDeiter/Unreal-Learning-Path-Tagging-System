  "text": " So, what is an editable property? So on the door locked what you'll see is a little eye icon. Although you can't see it when it's closed, you can definitely see it when it opens. So I'm going to click it and it's opened an eye. So that's a shut eye with a little eyelash, that's an open eye. So I want to open the eye, I'm going to click compile and save. I'm going to go back into my map and when I select the door, you'll see now we've got door properties here, which says is locked. It means we can edit this is locked property on the fly. And because I called it door properties, because I had good naming convention, that door properties in this category, again you don't need to do this, but whatever you called this category, you can now see that as a category. It keeps things nice and organized in your level and you'll be able to see that the door is locked. Now the really powerful thing here is if I duplicate this door, I'm going to hold down alt and left click and drag out. Again you could have added it as well by hitting control and space bar. We go to our quick draw and you can add it as a door in the level, but I don't want to add these doors. If you just select the door that you duplicated and you say is locked, no. So this door on the right, that's locked, that's not going to open. This door is not locked, no click. So when I play this, I would expect the first door not to open. So I'm pressing E, tapping E on my keyboard, if I still have that print string saying is locked, that would not be opening. So that's worked. If I go over to here and press E now, the door opens. So that's a very, very quick way to say is door locked? Yes or no. And then I've got two different instances and again, I've not had to edit any code apart from a tick box here. So that's a really powerful functionality of exposing variables so that they're editable inside of a blueprint. And you can add loads of good customization here. You can set light colors. You could add times for things to animate over. The creativity gets involved at that point and what kind of quick editable customization you want for your blueprints and what you could add in order to save time.",
