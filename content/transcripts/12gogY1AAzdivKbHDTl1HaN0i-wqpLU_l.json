  "text": " All right. Now that we've seen how we create the pickup and add score and things like that, what we're going to do now is we're going to use Unreal Motion Graphics so that we can create the interface that's going to go on our screen to show the user their score and the remaining time. Now, to use this, what we're going to do first is we are going to create a new widget blueprint class and name it HUD UMG. We're going to do this by right clicking in the content browser, going down to Widgets Blueprint, and then selecting our user widget as our widget base. So let's go ahead and we're going to pop over to the editor. There we go. And once we're inside the editor, we're going to right click on our content browser, User Interface, Widget Blueprint. From our Pick Parent class for new widget blueprint, we're going to select the User Widget option. And we are going to call this HUD underscore UMG. Now, once we have that done, we're going to double click on it to open it up. And the first thing that we have to do once we open it up is add something called the Canvas Panel. Now, a Canvas Panel allows us to add and group other elements to this UMG widget. Without the Canvas Panel, we'd only be able to put a singular button or a singular piece of text. So the Canvas Panel allows us to add multiple items to the same UI. So let's go ahead and double click on our HUD. And we're going to go over to the palette, and we're going to search for CAN. And there's our Canvas Panel. So we're just going to use our left mouse button to drag and drop this right down onto our hierarchy. And next, what we're going to do is we are going to add two pieces of text, one for our score and one for our time. Then we're going to position these pieces of text so that they will be anchored to the left and the right hand corner at the very top of the screen. Now, to do this, let's go ahead and add the text first. So we're going to just take this text and, again, left click, drag on the Canvas Panel, left click, drag on the Canvas Panel. Now, if I click on one of these, you're going to notice that there's this little flower. What this little flower icon is displaying is the location that that object will be pinned to as the pivot or the initial location when the screen is enlarged or reduced in size. This is super helpful because this means this one UI can be set up so that whenever it is used on an ultra wide monitor or a very small phone, the same UI and all of the buttons and everything will all still go to the same location that the user expects without you actually having to do any extra work or free any additional assets. So let's go ahead and set these up. So we're going to select this bottom one. And the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to hold down Control and I'm going to come over here to my anchors. And I'm going to click right over here on this very right hand one that is flashing. And that is going to move that text block over there. And there's a couple of things I need to do. So first things first, we're going to set the text size to 64. Always find that it's easier to position these in place with the end text, the size that you want it. If you get it in position and then change the text, it's going to change how this actually looks and give you a bad time. Next thing we're going to do is we're going to change this to size to content because we want this size of this to represent the score or the text. And we're also going to come up here to our text and we're going to call this one time. So T-M-E. And we're going to also come down to our shape outline and set this. Whoops, not like that. We're going to set that to about a 2. There we go. And we also need a capital T for our time there. There we go. There's our time. So now our time is obviously not in the greatest position because everything needs to be on the inside of this dotted line. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to our position here and set this to negative 100. And then we are going to set our position in the Y to 100. And then I'm going to do something kind of cool. I'm going to take this alignment and set this to 1 by 1. And oh, sorry, just 1. I mean, not by 1. There we go. And what this is going to do is it's basically going to kind of flip our transform of this and put it so that it is in the inside over here. Without us having to go all crazy trying to position this using the X and the Y, I just find that adjusting the alignment can help. So again, let's do this same thing over here. We're going to grab this. We're going to call this one score. And then, oops, unselected it. So we have our time. We have our score. So again, 64, size to content, line size 2. And then what we're going to do is we're going to go 100. And 100. There we go. And that is it. So we've got our score. We have our time. And the coolest part is that they're going to stay relative to those locations as our UI changes in size. So that's exactly the behavior that we want. And as you can see here, this is what we've got. We've got our score. We have got our time. Now next, what we're going to do is we are going to set up something called a binding. And a binding allows us to read from any particular value that we have inside of one of our blueprints and then relay that information in our UI. However, one thing to note here, bindings can be relatively expensive, especially as your game progresses and gets bigger and more complicated. For this particular project, text binding in this application isn't really going to cause that much of a performance issue. Again, this is something that has another way. But this is the most simplistic way to do this. And it could become a performance problem, especially if you're working on an MMO or some type of action RPG that has a very complicated interface that might be listening to a bunch of values. This is where you could get into problems with that. But for our game, we're only going to be having very, very few things listening to this. So this is all good. Now again, what we're going to be doing is creating a binding. And that binding is going to link text from our blueprint to our UI. To do that, what we do is we come down to our text and we click on the menu called Bind. And then we select the Create Bind option. So let's go ahead and do that now. So we're going to go to our score. And then right here for our score, so make sure our score is selected, Bind, Create Binding. And this is going to create our binding. But what are we actually going to be doing? Well, what we're going to be doing is creating this little bit of Blueprint code. What this code is going to do is it's going to go out to our player pawn. It's going to cast to our vehicle Blueprint. And then it's going to get the current score. And then we're going to take that current score and we're going to format this text so that it will say score. But the value that you see there will be reflected from the get current score. So this is really cool because this means that we can have a text value that signifies what this is and then have our number. And we don't actually have to manage two different widgets to get the same information. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now. And first things first, we are going to get player pawn. So there's our get player pawn. And then from our player pawn, we are going to cast to we want our advanced vehicle pawn because that is the one that we're using for this example. We're going to then right click on this and convert to a pure cast. And once we have this in a pure cast, we are going to look for as the vehicle advanced pawn, our current. And there we go, get current score. And I'm going to pull this over here. So next what we need to do is we're going to pull off of this and we're going to look for format. And we might need to disable context sensitive. There we go, format text. So oops, just going to undo this for a second and go ahead and delete that. So there we go. All right. So with our format text, what we need to do first is we're going to put in score, semicolon, and then we're going to put in two curly brackets and then the word value. And when we do this, what we're going to get is right underneath that, we're going to get a value. So we're going to input our value. And then we're going to take our result here and plug that right into our return value. So again, what we're going to first do is get our player pawn. We are going to cast to our vehicle advanced pawn because that's where we're doing all of our calculations. We're going to get our current score. And then using that value, we are going to first put the word score, semicolon, and then this value. And that is what is actually going to be added to our particular piece of code on the UI or a piece of information on the UI. I'm going to compile and save. And what we're going to do next is we're going to do the same thing, but this time with our time. So we're going to select our time. We're going to do basically get game mode, cast to our vehicle advanced game mode, and then get our time remaining. So let's go ahead and do that now. So we are going to come back to not our event graph, but our designer. We're going to select time. Remember, content, text, bind, create binding. There we go. And then what we want to do is get game mode. So get game mode. There we go, get game mode. And then we are going to cast to because it's called vehicle game mode. Vehicle advanced game mode. There we go. We're going to right click on this and convert it to a pure cast because we know that we are getting a specific value from in there. And what are we going to do? Well, we're going to pull off of this. And we are going to get time. And I'm going to enable context sensitivity. Get time. There we go. Get time remaining. And what do we want to do with this? Well, we want to format. So we're going to look for format text. There we go. And what do we want to do? Well, this is going to be our time. And let me just make sure that we get a. And then we're going to do bracket and curly bracket and then value like so. And last but not least, plug this in and then compile. And we make sure that we save our blueprint.",
