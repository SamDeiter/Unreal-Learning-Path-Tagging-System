  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go ahead and make our own NPC and create the materials to be able to edit and tweak them the way that we need to, to be able to bring it back into Sequencer and to have it fully animated. So let's get started. So in Unreal I'm going to show you some tips and tricks to get things going so we can actually start from scratch from Sequencer and be able to blend things the way that we need to. There's a few things we do need to consider when working with the NPCs. You'll see that I already have a material called m underscore npc demo and we're going to go ahead and look at that in just a bit. I want to point out some things between specular and rough that we need to keep in mind. Alright, so let's go ahead and make our npc material node. So we're going to go to a material and we're going to go to npc material parameter collection. It's down at the bottom here. I'm going to click on that and let's go ahead and call this one npc underscore new demo. Hit enter and I'm going to double click on it. You'll see we have a relatively clean slate here and we're going to go ahead and add a couple scalar parameters. Hit that twice and we're going to create one color vector parameter. There we go. And in here I'm going to go ahead and each one of these I should say I'm going to go ahead and say what they do. This one's going to be my spec amount. The next one, open that up. This one's going to be my rough amount. I'm going to point out how these work because it's easy to forget this as we go through materials. You've taken all the material classes, but spec and rough work very different from each other and the fact that one is on and zero is off. I should say basically be a parallel from each other. They're different and in that when they are like that, you can actually turn one off and turn one on if they're special, if they're underneath each other. So spec can actually influence your rough if you're not careful. But in our case, we want spec to compliment our rough and I'll show you how that works. So I'm going to go ahead and go to the last one here, the color, and we'll call this color control. Very cool. All right. And to keep it consistent, we'll just keep these guys together. I'm going to go and hit save on this and we're going to go back to our MPC demo. Now if you don't know where that's at, it's right here. Just double click on it and it'll populate. Now I don't have this in the class here because I wanted to be able to actively demo this so you can actually see how this works. If it's just a sitting there, it might be a bit confusing. But if you want to make one really quick, you can. And I simply just went in here and created my material and I built a texture for it. Just hit the T key again and loaded a simple dirt texture. This is if you just want to follow along. And in that I created a blend overlay, a multiply, and a simple scalar parameter and a couple scalar parameters so I can demonstrate the difference between a spec and rough when it comes to having them fire and be on when it comes to sequencer. Let me show you what I mean. We'll pick on these guys first. So these two fellows work very differently from each other. And what I mean by that, let me go ahead and disconnect my roughness. Now you'll notice immediately when I disconnect my roughness, it's not quite as shiny. We see that they are complementing each other. But we'll notice that if I disconnect my spec and reconnect, and you'll notice there's still a little bit of spec going on because default spec is 0.5. It's kind of halfway. If I reconnect, put my rough in here, you'll notice, hey, we got shininess. And then if we reconnect our spec, you'll notice, oh, it's a little bit more shiny. They are complementing each other. But there's a difference between on and off. When it comes to rough, 0 is on. When it comes to spec, 1 is on. I know it's a bit confusing. But the problem is if we start to animate this in sequencer, we could actually get our numbers and not quite get the values we exactly want. You can actually play with these in such a way and have them initially set to be on within your MPC if you wanted to. So in our spec, we want to actually reverse these. We want spec to be 0. And we want rough. And you'll notice when I hit 0, rough is automatically turned off. That's not fair. So that's because rough spec will influence rough and mess things up. We want rough to be also off. And when he's off, he's set to 1. So we want to set these guys both in that setting with that, those numbers. So let's go to spec and set that to 0. It's already there. And we can set our rough already to 1. Now, if you want to, you can make this negative. Now, these are just scalar parameters. And I did a test on this and this actually worked OK to keep this at 1 if we wanted to. You can try keeping it at 0, but you'll have to play with those numbers in sequencer because remember, it acts differently. 1 is on and 0 is off. In the case of when you're looking at spec. So spec 1 is on, 0 is off. And rough, it's opposite of that. 1 is off and 0 is on. So that's where it can get really confusing. So you just I'm putting myself in a place so that they're neutral. And again, they can influence each other, I should say, at a starting point where they're just not on and they can influence each other. So if I go to spec and turn this back on again. And then I turn rough back on again. You can now see just how bright and shiny they are. Then if we go to specular and turn it off. You'll notice that mutes are rough. That's not fair. We'll have to completely disconnect it to be able to get rough to come back. So this is what I mean by you got to be careful. These guys are going to push and pull on each other. Not necessarily the most ideal, but when you're animating in sequencer, you have to keep those things in mind. All right. Let me disconnect these completely. You actually just delete them. Now, when it comes to color, the information also is not treated the same. We created an NPC. Let's go ahead and save our properties that we have. And let's go and drag that NPC into our scene. Now, this NPC, we need to let Unreal know our intentions. So in this case, we're going to say this is our color information. Now, this color information, if we wanted to, we can do several different ways to blend things together, but we can't just go in here and create a multiply. And connect it because the way that this information is parsed is not like a regular constant vector. So if I go in here and put this in, oof, you're going to get an error, right? So it's not going to digest that information correctly. So one way around it is we can create a blend overlay and create our color amount. And it can be a texture if you want to, or it can just be a simple shade if you want. In this case, the blend overlay is handling our stuff a little bit weird. It's actually pushing through the texture information according to like you would use a blend overlay in Photoshop. But you can choose whatever you want in here. Blend wise, I'm just using this as a demo. We can make things a little bit more color overlay if we wanted to. So blend color if we wanted, we can do a color burn, a color dodge. You can totally do that if you want to. So I just want to point that out. So you have those options, but I'm just going to keep this one the way it is for now. And we can even just swap it out with a simple texture so we can see it a little bit better on screen. Okay, so we need to pull in the NPC again a few more times. So let's pull in the NPC one, and then also just Ctrl D two, this is going to be our spec and rough. And we're going to create a multiply for each one of these multiply and multiply. And we can go in here. And let's set this first one to our right. And then we're going to go in here and set this to our rough or I should say spec amount. And the next one's going to be our rough amount. And since we're using dirt, let's go ahead and get a simple dirt texture in here. I'm using this without normals. I'm just going to use the texture black and white information for the spec. Load that to the top there. And that's fine, like my sample. So at least it's consistent. Pull them to specular and pull this across. And we'll do the same thing with her rough. Give the M key or Ctrl D in this case. Pull this in the bottom. Not a multiply, I should say scalar, right? Pull this over here. And we'll duplicate the texture one more time. We're totally cheating. We need to duplicate the texture not use this scalar. So let's do Ctrl D. And we'll show up where our mouse is at. Swap these out a little bit. And let's go and plug these in and plug this into the A channel and plug this into the B channel. There we go. And pull that right into the rough. Now again, we're not getting any information here for our rough here is set to one. And the scalar one is set to zero. So just keep those things in mind when you bring them in to Sequencer. And we're going to go ahead and save that information. In our case, we could just hit apply so that it's updating and we can decide whether we even like it or not because we may not like it. It's up to us how that works. All right, so now let's go ahead to our scene. And in our scene, let's go and load a sphere. So I'm going to go and load a simple sphere. We've got a basics and we'll go to our sphere here shapes. There we go. So let's go ahead and load a simple basic shape. Let's go to sphere. There we go. Let me go ahead and move the sphere over and increase its size. So you can see it better. Now what we want to do is load a few things. Let's actually first apply our material to our sphere. There we go. In this sphere, we want to go ahead and also load those objects in our Sequencer. So I'm going to click on the track here. I'm going to add actor. Let's grab that sphere. And then let's also add underneath our NPC effects here. We can actually go here to add another NPC or actually this is a better way. You go to track and you go to material parameter collections and we can find the one that we have called the new NPC demo. There we go. So let's click on that. And we see that we have the new NPC demo there. And with that set in, we want to go ahead and edit some of these. Now let's actually go to the first keyframe before the rain hit. And we're going to hit that plus parameter. We're going to load the rough amount. It's going to auto key it for us. Hit that plus parameter again. And we're going to load spec amount. Hit that plus parameter again and load color in there. So we're going to load color. So we're keying all of those for NPC and we can open it up to see them keyed. So as I drag it across, we go all the way over here. We can now change our color information. So we can increase the red if we want to. Just a little shiny red. And you'll see it actually works pretty well with that blend overlay. Now again, the blend overlay is going to react differently like in Photoshop depending on what your material and texture is like. But that just showed you one way to be able to blend them. We can now go in here under spec amount and we can increase or decrease things according to what we need. Now if you want to, we have it set default to one. We can set that to zero. And we can do spec to one. And you'll see we actually have it nice and shiny. And they're complementing each other. Notice that spec was turning everything off. So we can now have that all keyframed in here. And we can now see this sphere start to change color and get wet in our scene. Pretty cool. All right. Well, that's about it with this one. Hope this makes sense to you and helps you kind of navigate using NPCs. Materials are very tricky in the fact that you want to make sure their state is in a neutral state or a nice starting point to bring them into Sequencer and get them to read accordingly. Notice we're not controlling the range. So you do need to know your numbers ahead of time. So just keep those things in mind. That's it with this video. In the next video, we're going to look at some more materials which can really complement your scene such as subsurface. Thanks again.",
