  "text": " All right, we're now going to take a look at groom shadowing and lighting as there's a few settings on our groom that can affect how the groom is going to react to environment lighting and things like that. So here is some examples of the various settings that you will actually find here. So if we pop over here to our groom, I'm talking about these settings that we're going to find right here as well as our hair shadow density. It's a little bit easier to show you here in this PowerPoint. So first off, no settings. This is going to be our default that you see, and that is also going to include voxelize. Voxelize enables strand voxelization for casting environment occlusion. This basically allows us to have the hair look like it's getting some occlusion from things that are around it. Enabling use stable rasterization will ensure the hair does not alias. When enabled, groups of hair might appear thicker and isolated hair should remain thin. So this is a great way if you have different types of hair, like maybe you have some smaller clumps or bigger clumps or something like that to help things not alias so bad. Now scatter scene lighting, but enabled this will light the hair with the scene color and is used for short hair or peach fuzz to help kind of bring light from the surrounding surface like the skin to illuminate. And this particular example, it doesn't make a lot of sense because this is very long hair. But if we were doing something like beard hair or some peach fuzz or maybe some really light arm hair, this would be a better setting to have enabled as it would make things more pronounced. And then last we have what the hair would look like with everything enabled. Now this is just for demonstration purposes. You may or may not need to enable all of these settings depending on your light setup and what you're trying to accomplish with your groom lighting. It's just to show you that there are some things that you can do to adjust the lighting for your groom based on what your groom is trying to accomplish.",
