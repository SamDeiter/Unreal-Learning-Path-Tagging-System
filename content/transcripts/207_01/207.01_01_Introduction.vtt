Hello and welcome to another Unreal Engine 5 training course.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Today we're going to be taking a look at Alembic Importing and Live Link.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
As an overview of the course, we're going to be taking a look at how to work with Alembic animations in Unreal Engine 5,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
including a look at some of the tools in Maya for exporting,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
some information on Alembic caches themselves and some of the uses in Unreal Engine 5.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll also have an overview of the Live Link feature,

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so going over the pipeline and seeing how you can stream your animations into Unreal Engine and see it in your scene,

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and just going over the steps to connect it from Maya to Unreal Engine 5.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And along the way we'll take a look at some Blender tools, we'll understand a bit about the Datasmith,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we'll see how to get your Alembic cache animations playing in your scene using some of the sequencer tools.
