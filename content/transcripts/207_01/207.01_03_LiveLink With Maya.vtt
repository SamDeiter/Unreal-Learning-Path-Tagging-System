00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Now let's take a look at Unreal Engine's Live Link plugin with Maya.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.880
Now we'll look at an overview of the concept, understanding the pipeline and just how we

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640
go about setting it up.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.560
Live Link, if you've not heard of it before, is a way to stream your animation from Maya

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.500
into Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.120
Now this allows you to animate directly inside Maya and through the use of Live Link preview

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.880
what it will look like inside the engine in real time.

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.040
Now this is great because you get to see how your character looks with all the materials

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.000
and the lighting and any extra elements on them like cloth that might be applied to them

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
without having to go through the export and import process.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.360
When it comes to understanding the pipeline of Live Link, you have a plugin for both Maya

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.040
and for Unreal that you either need to download or just simply activate.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.400
And in Maya you would define the skeleton that you're using and the character's data

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
that you want to send over to Unreal Engine.

15
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.000
And then this goes through the Unreal message bus, which is basically a direct channel to

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.880
the Live Link client within your Unreal project.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.960
Now the Live Link client manages a couple of things.

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.140
So it manages the sources of data that are coming in, which represent the connections

19
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.900
to other programs like Maya or MotionBuilder that can send data to Live Link.

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.720
And it also manages the subjects, which is to say the individual streams of data within

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.720
the client.

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
An example of that would be animation information going through for one character.

23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880
Now this information is then used in conjunction with a Live Link animation node inside your

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
animation blueprint to convert that data into animation data on the character in the engine.

25
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.200
Some of the component features of Live Link in Unreal Engine 5 are the Live Link controller

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
and the skeletal animation components.

27
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.680
Now the controller component is a quick way of taking the Live Link data and applying

28
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.800
that to an actor in your scene.

29
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
So as you can see in the example we've got below, this might be taking the transform

30
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.400
information and applying that to a camera to aid something like a virtual production

31
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.760
environment that you're in.

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.080
We've also got the skeletal animation component.

33
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.680
So this sits inside your blueprint and gives you access to the onLiveLinkUpdated event,

34
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.320
which effectively takes place of your tick event, but it runs at editor time as well.

35
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.280
So you don't need to be playing or simulating to make use of that data.

36
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.200
You can also access the Live Link data via several blueprint nodes to gather and use

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.160
various bits of information like curve data or metadata and different types of transform

38
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.960
information.

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.760
So now that we've taken a look at some of the features that overview the pipeline of

40
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.560
Live Link, let's take a look at how to actually get it set up and connect Maya with Unreal

41
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.960
Engine to see your animation streaming live.

42
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.800
So the first thing you'll need to do is go to the Epic Games Marketplace and download

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920
the Unreal Live Link for Autodesk Maya plugin.

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.240
Once you've downloaded this, you need to install it to Maya.

45
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.680
Now to load your plugin in Maya, if you've not done this before, if you go to Windows,

46
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.400
down to settings and preferences, and then into your plugin manager, you'll get a list

47
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.600
of plugins that are already installed on your machine that you can sort of load, activate

48
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.320
or deactivate.

49
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.640
But if you've not had one installed before and you need to install something new like

50
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.160
the Maya Live Link plugin, you should have a browse option.

51
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Now if you click the browse option and find the folder where the plugin was saved, you

52
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.680
need to load two different plugins, one called Maya Live Link plugin and then the date, which

53
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.440
may not be 2017 anymore, .ml and then the Maya Live Link UI Python plugin.

54
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.760
Now once your plugins are installed and loaded, to access the Live Link UI, you would use

55
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.040
the melinput command, Maya Live Link UI.

56
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.080
Now you'd put that into your mel line at the bottom of the screen or into your script editor.

57
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.560
You can then save that as a button to your shelf just to make accessing it easier each

58
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.720
time.

59
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.240
Now this UI is where you'd add or remove subjects whose data you want to send over to Live Link

60
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.680
in your Unreal Engine project.

61
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.680
Now to do that, you just choose add selection and you'd select your mesh and root bone of

62
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.560
the character you'd like to stream to Unreal.

63
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.400
But before you can do that, we need to ensure that the plugin is enabled in your Unreal

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.080
project.

65
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.840
So by default, the Live Link plugin should be available in a UE5 project, but if it's

66
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.760
not for any reason and you're using an older version of the engine maybe, you can download

67
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.960
it in the same way that you did with the Maya plugin using the Epic Marketplace.

68
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680
Now you can check if it's loaded by going to your plugins window and searching for Live

69
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.600
Link and just making sure that it's ticked.

70
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.880
And once you have it loaded, you'll have access to a new window inside Window, Virtual Production

71
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.460
called Live Link.

72
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.980
And inside this window, this is where you'll be controlling the Live Link sources and it'll

73
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.740
show you a connection to your DCC like Maya or Motion Builder.

74
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.820
Now something to be aware of and something you should check in your project settings

75
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.680
would be the use less CPU when in background option.

76
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.620
Now if that's turned on, it will inhibit the use of the Live Link when you're working in

77
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.620
Maya.

78
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.940
So if you're tapped out working in Maya, you won't be able to see the animation streaming

79
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.940
live.

80
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.260
So make sure you disable that.

81
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.300
Now to add your source, which would be the information coming from Maya, for example,

82
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.140
you just hit the plus source button, go to Message Bus Source, and you should see a list

83
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.700
of sources matching the selections that you added in Maya.

84
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.200
Now that the Live Link connection is made, you can start to preview the animation on

85
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.260
your character by opening up the corresponding skeletal mesh inside Unreal Engine.

86
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.660
And you should have a new option underneath the animation preview controller drop down

87
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.500
Live Link Preview Controller just inside your Preview Scene Settings tab.

88
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.460
Now if you select this and then change the Live Link subject name just underneath to

89
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.460
match that of your character in Maya, you should see your skeletal mesh begin to match

90
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.740
the animation of your Maya character.

91
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.500
Now something that can be useful as well is to tick the Enable Camera Sync option in the

92
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.260
same Preview Scene Settings tab so that when you move your camera in Maya, the camera in

93
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Unreal should mimic that.

94
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And that should be it.

95
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.820
You should now be able to animate your character in Maya and preview it on your skeletal mesh

96
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.020
in your Unreal project.
