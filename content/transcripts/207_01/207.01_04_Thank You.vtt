00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So that brings us to the end of this course.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hopefully now you have an understanding of Alembic files

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the best way for you to import them for your own use,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as well as a variety of ways of playing these geometric animations in your own project,

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as well as the knowledge to set up a Live Link connection between Maya and Unreal

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so that you can speed up your workflow when you're wanting to see

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
just how your character is deforming an engine

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and how any sort of procedural items might be reacting to the animation.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So thank you very much.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thanks for watching!
