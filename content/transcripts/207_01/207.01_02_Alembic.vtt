00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what is an Alembic cache or an Alembic file?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's a baked geometric animation.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So that's basically saying that it's a way to bake down or to store the information of your rigged mesh to the geometry itself and import just the geometry, not the skeleton.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, something important to note is that Unreal only supports meshes that have faces with three or four sides.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So if you're getting errors when you're importing, it's worth checking your mesh just to ensure that it has no faces with more than four sides.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The support for Alembic files comes with a plugin built into UE5.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So this should come already loaded, but if not, just search for Alembic inside your plugin window.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Just tick the box to activate it and you'll get access to the import options.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, you can also bring in multiple assets with an Alembic file, not just the animation itself.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And you can combine or you can merge these on import depending on how you want to set up your scene.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And the main use for an Alembic file or an Alembic animation would be for use in cinematics.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So when you want a pre-baked animation that you can get a great video render with and you don't need any procedural elements to the character's movement or the skeleton,

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
they can be quite computationally expensive.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So they're not recommended for use with mobile devices.

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And they work with most of your external DCC programs that have the ability to export an Alembic cache.

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So they work with Mair, 3ds Max, Blender, etc.

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When exporting an Alembic file, there are a couple of options that we just wanted to highlight.

18
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So if we take a look at Mair's workflow here, you have two different export options.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So you can choose to export everything in the scene, including any baked Alembic caches you might have,

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
along with any of the meshes that you've got in the scene and export everything all as one file.

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Or you can just select a specific mesh or a group of meshes and use the export selection method here.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now, if you select the option box on either of these methods,

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you'll get a handful of settings that come up and you can change for the export.

24
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But again, there's just a couple that we wanted to highlight that we thought might be useful for importing into Unreal.

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, you can choose your frame range, which is to say you can set when the animation starts and ends.

26
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So you can get the exact section that you want, or you can choose to export the whole animation itself.

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There's also the UV write option.

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So for material purposes, you want to make sure that you check this option so that it saves the correct UVs you've made

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and allows you to apply materials correctly in the engine later on.

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And there's also the write face sets option.

31
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So you want to make sure that with your meshes that you have, you apply the materials to them at the face value in your DCC.

32
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So that is to say, go through and select all of the individual faces of the mesh or the meshes

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and apply the materials to those faces directly so that Unreal can bring them in as elements on your mesh

34
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and apply the materials correctly for you.

35
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, this is specifically for use when importing as a geometry cache, which we'll cover in a moment.

36
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
When it comes to importing your Alembic file into the engine, you can define how you want to import it in a few different ways.

37
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So if you choose to import your Alembic cache as a static mesh, what you'll get is one static mesh per frame of animation that you have

38
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
based on the frame start and end values under the sampling heading just here.

39
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now, if you exported several meshes within your Alembic file, you can tick the merge meshes option, which will create one single static mesh.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, if you disable this option, each mesh within that Alembic file will be imported into the engine as an individual static mesh itself for every frame that you have.

41
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now, bear in mind, if you do have multiple meshes and you choose to merge them, the origin or the pivot point of all the meshes will snap to world zero as they merge.

42
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So if this is something that you don't want, make sure to tick propagate matrix transforms and the meshes will retain their position in world space when they merge together.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Now, you also have the option to import as a skeletal mesh.

44
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This will create several base poses taken from the animation and use them as morph targets to blend between to achieve the correct animation frame.

45
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, this is done as part of the animation compression.

46
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And before you hit import, you have the option to define the percentage or the number of base poses and to tweak that level of compression and get the animation looking how you want it.

47
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And lastly, you can import as the geometry cache.

48
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now, this is an experimental feature at the moment and that creates a new type of animation asset that allows the playback of vertex varying sequences.

49
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So the animation will come in as one file and be played back as a flip book of frames.

50
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
One thing to note is that the performance of this will depend on the complexity of your mesh.

51
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So if you have a very complex mesh, then it's going to be much less performant than a simpler mesh.

52
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And with the geometry cache, you also get some extra options to import things like motion vectors of the vertices, which can be really useful to calculate motion blur.

53
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, you also have the ability to choose the frame range you'd like to import under the sampling heading that we looked at a second ago, as well as choose to import the materials with your meshes that you bring in.

54
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You have a few different ways you can control the playback of the animation once you've imported into the engine.

55
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Now, if you have an Alembic asset like a geometry crash in your level, for example, you have the option to check what's called the running option here.

56
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And that is essentially an autoplay option.

57
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So when the level starts, if this is checked, this animation will play automatically.

58
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
You could also set the animation to looping just by checking the looping option.

59
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
As you can imagine, that just makes the animation continuously loop until the level's over.

60
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You could also add the asset to your level blueprint and just set up any parameters that you want in there to say when the animation is allowed to play.

61
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And another option you have is to use a sequencer track.

62
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So this has a very simple setup.

63
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And just by adding the mesh to the sequence, you can add a geometry cache track and have your animation play when you scrub through or when you trigger the sequence.

64
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And you can also add a geometry cache component, which might be material or property or any sort of other miscellaneous data that you might want to control during the sequence.
