  "text": " Now let's look at path tracer to see what features we can utilize in our project. So path tracer uses the same ray tracing architecture as other ray tracing features such as the real time ray tracing and the GPU lightmass, making it ideal for ground truth comparisons and production renders. So we may use path tracer with some arcvays, maybe film and TV, we can get refractive glass, we've got global illumination in reflections, subsurface scattering, etc. So the path tracer only uses geometry and material present in the scene to render an unbiased result and does not share the same ray tracing code that has been developed to work well for real time rendering. So if ray tracing is kept on switching between the path tracer view mode and lip mode, ray trace materials will not view the same here. So as we mentioned on the material setup for the ray tracing, just make sure those switches are set up correctly. And so to enable path tracer in your projects, we want to go to the project settings again, and then we want to go to the rendering section. And then under hardware ray tracing, we've got a few options. So we've got the support hardware ray tracing, we've got path tracer, the platforms are the DX12 here, which is the default RHI. And then we've got the engine rendering optimization where we want to enable support compute skin cache. And then once active, you want to change your lighting mode to path tracer in the drop down there. And then with ray tracing setup, we want to drag in a post process volume, we want to set up our exposure as desired. And then so for example, in these settings that we've got here, we've got auto exposure, basic or auto exposure histogram and manual, whichever is desired. And we can explore a further course with exposure and setting exposures. If you'd like to dial into those settings more specifically, we can also set the min max EV 100 where appropriate if you just want a basic pass on exposure, then in the path trace settings, we want to set these following settings. So your settings should look similar to this. And then we just want to note that the max path exposure needs to be a few steps above the overall exposure to support any kind of emissive materials. When it comes to editing the properties of the post process volume, we have a few things that we can change here. We've got max bounces, which controls the amount of path tracer bounces for your scene. Three to five is a good measure for performance, but 32 will be a default there. You've got samples per pixel. And that essentially default value is 2048, but more like 1600 is better. In class that you'll have gone through is set to 500 for performance. So higher is better quality. The filter width is set the anti-aliasing filter for the path tracer. And then in this instance, the lower values, sharper, higher is softer. And then the emissive materials, this activates it to be calculated on the emissive side. And then the max path exposure set slightly higher overall than exposure in the post process volume. And then we've got the reference depth of field, which remedies an old issue for translucency depth of field. And then we've got the denoiser, which is a key component for quality control with path tracer to just denoise the overall renders there. To render the depth of field, reference the depth of field, sorry. In the past versions of path tracer, there was a major issue with translucency in depth of field. And the problem was that the translucent material doesn't render to the depth buffer. So basically it wasn't getting an accurate depth of field. So in here, you can see that the path tracer settings, we can remedy that now with a nice little tick box that should fix those issues for you. So with path tracer, we've got some new materials and features here. So the eye shader is now supported, the hair is now supported, and we've also got glass absorption. So the lower the number, the less absorption, and then the higher the number, the more light will pass through. So worth considering these material upgrades if you are using path tracer. And then Unreal Engine 5's implementation of energy conservation is used to reduce the energy loss in the specular lobe of metals and glass materials. So we can turn on energy conservation from the project settings under engine rendering and the material section here, which is a handy little tick box in the material setting. And as we alluded to in the ray tracing section, we've got a new quality switch replaced for path tracer, which is worth highlighting in case you want to switch between normal and path traced materials in your material instances. To reduce these artifacts, as you can see, we've got some noise going on here. So the path tracer simulates light by randomly tracing rays according to the material properties. So when it's bright areas of the scene, you may have a low probability of being discovered, and then the resulting samples can become excessively bright, creating specks of light or little fireflies on your image that appear to disappear within the frame. So path tracer attempts to minimize the most common sources of these effects, but they can still occur in some scenarios here. So when the path trace result is combined with the bloom post processing pass, the resulting pixels can be particularly noticeable because of how they appear and disappear, or maybe become brighter or dimmer, for example. So the post process settings max exposure path under the path tracing option here controls the maximum exposure using the rendered path tracing scene. So you can adjust that exposure to be a few steps higher than the current scene exposure, and we can set the post process maxi V100, which is found in the lens exposure settings. So that will reduce the chance of fireflies occurring. And here we're a little bit higher, but we get some great results in the image. And then looking at the denoising rendering. So even with high sample counts of path tracer will always have a bit of residual noise in the rendered frame. The denoising option in the post process volume, as we spoke about before, can help you make use of Intel's open image denoise library to remove the noise from the last sample. So it's just worth noting that the denoiser runs on the CPU and is not currently designed for interactive denoising, but it instead helps improve the quality of long running frames. So it doesn't really currently guarantee temporal consistency and relatively high samples per pixel are required for a stable output. So the temporal stability can also be improved by increasing the temporal sample count in the anti-aliasing settings in the movie render queue. So it's also worth noting that any animated items may still get that flickering shadow and setting the spatial sample count and temporal to 10 can help. So path tracer is still evolving. It's worth checking what current engine version you're on, seeing what the latest documentation is, and always going off the most up to date information to see what options are available for your given project. When looking at the denoising of your scenes. So the more samples that we have with denoiser on the better results we're going to get for the final renders using the same render. So the more samples that we have with denoiser on the better results we're going to get for the final renders using the movie render queue. So the default in the post process volume is going to be 16384. The filter width acts as an anti-aliasing filter. So larger blurry anti-aliasing and lower sharper results and the emissive materials allow for HDRI backdrops to be used to give off light or other material with emissive properties. And you can see some of the path tracer settings that we're using here. So how to set up our materials for path tracer. So glass is a classic example of the use of path tracer. So there are two methods for rendering glass with specified thickness with the path tracer. So we can use a few values that are physically accurate on the physical properties of the surface. And then we can then use additional properties such as a Fresnel for more control of the air direction which are less accurate but allows for reflection fall off control. So to create physically accurate glass you just need a few simple values with path tracer. So if you want something less accurate you've got a few simple material elements here. We've got some more accurate results with some added values and then we've got an even more accurate value example on the right hand side. So again just dialing in how you want to approach opacity for example whether you want to take it the Fresnel approach or a parameter value. You can dial it in between less accurate which is a little bit more stylized to the most accurate which is more realistic to what you might want in your scenes. So that's all well and good for a thick glass shader but how about approaching a thin glass shader. So the thin translucent shading model is useful for achieving something that's physically accurate and appropriately colored translucent shadowing for thick glass with some caustics that are approximated well in the scene. So we can create a translucent material as you can see here the blend mode is set to translucent. We want to change the shading model to thin translucent and then we want to change the lighting mode to the surface forward shading here which is the and then we want to add a thin translucent material output node to add color to. So thin translucent material this is the output node that we want to use and these results will then give you a bit more of a thin glass shader for setup in your material. The roughness can affect the transparency shadows as well so the path tracer is unique in that it allows for the rendering of rough transmission. And in addition to the rough reflection and in the case of the path tracer these shader parameters are coupled together. So the roughness value of the glass material varies to demonstrate the approximate caustics and the roughness of the reflection and then the effect it has on the translucent shadow being cast. So in all the materials of the translucent objects contact shadows can be enabled to get some more realistic effects. We can also make a glass light absorption material so if we create a constants three node and pick the color we can then create a power node and then divide that result. Connect the absorption scalar to the lower the scalar so the lower the number the less absorption so the higher number the more light passes are going to go through this so we can create an absorption node. And then connect the divide to the power node to then run through the absorption medium which is only used in path tracer. We can also start to think about editing the settings of path tracer so path tracer uses approximate caustic paths to help reduce noise. So this is especially in cases where glass or metal or surfaces have lower roughness values than the surface. So for these types of materials the reflective caustics can produce various patterns and can take up an impractical amount of time or samples to converge for a noise free image. So because caustics are generally taking a long time to converge to a noise free result the path tracer reduces image noise by approximating caustics that would be present in the image and then we can dial the image to the image. And using the caustics denoiser we've got another element to consider which is the difference between the refractive caustics and the approximate caustics. So here we can see that the caustics are in the image and the image is in the image. So we can see that the caustics are in the image and the image is in the image. On and off, we've also got the show flag of path tracing so setting this path to 1 can allow you to call path tracing directly including at runtime so that may or not be desired and then setting it to 0 will force it off. Number 2 in this instance is the default which removes any specific overrides from the flag. And again we can use this console window that we were referring to before to set up different prefix and configurations of these CVars so you can dial in the results that you want. And then lastly we've got the sampler type which changes the sampler to allow you to tweak the sampling process to accommodate for speed and quality there. And then lastly before we get into some tips here we've got the skylight. So the current skylight capture is only visible when real-time capture is enabled so to improve the render quality we want to increase the resolution of the skylight which then capture it to be higher than usual if you're using a real-time project you may not use these kind of values. So we're not using real-time capture the skybox or the sphere is expected to have the sky representation and then its material must have the flag is sky enabled in the material settings otherwise its illumination will be double counted against the skylighting. So you can see the images here on the right hand side with the skylight real-time capture and sky box mesh is given two different results so it's likely to produce some noise since it won't be important in the sample. So the skybox and sphere shapes should also not cast shadows because they can occlude the contributions from the skylight and the directional light there. And then some extra tips here before we close out the path tracing section we've got a few extra CVars here so we've got the progress bar, we've got the flush dispatch, we've got the dispatch size 1024 which will trace fewer pixels at a time and that should help avoid any kind of GPU hangs or even worst case crashes. We've got the visible lights that we mentioned before and then the invalidation threshold at once make that path tracer converge when the hair grooms simulation is enabled. We also have the editing of shaders especially if the metahuminae comes in black which is a temporary fix so in the metahuminae shader in the material instance eye occlusion we can create the parent material here and just replace that with the switch replace as we mentioned before. So what would cause us to do this so just remember in the beginning we mentioned that the shader model needed to be simple for translucency to have accuracy and path tracer so that this switch just helps replace that and keeps a simple flow there. And then a couple of limitations before we close out the fog is now supported but not all settings are fully supported so not all the controls are supported as some of the parameters have non-physical meaning. The primary parameters supported here are the fog density and falloff, scattering distribution, the albedo, extinction scale and the view distance. Just a note on the view distance though that is used to limit the region of influence in the height fog since infinite extents can lead to long render times. We've got the volumetric clouds which are now partially supported, we've got motion blur which is partially supported but spline meshes still are not supported in the current 5.1 engine version. Some optimization we've got with a plugin here when both the optics denoise and open image denoise plugins are enabled for your projects you must use a console variable spatial denoiser and then that will choose which denoiser will be used when denoising is enabled in the post process volume. And then Windows also tries to maintain system responsiveness by limiting the amount of time it takes to make the project more efficient. This is a little bit of a preview of what the GPU kernel can take so for a resource intensive process such as a brute force path tracing this limit can hit more frequently, particularly on some lower end GPUs so just make sure you keep this in mind.
