  "text": " And then before we close out, let's look at some useful tips for getting started with your project. So as we spoke about before, creating sub scene tracks is going to be super useful for working with multiple people on these shots and these sequences. So whether you want to organize per department, maybe have character animation effects, lighting, etc. You can essentially nest the storyboard sequences into a standard level sequence. And then we can kind of go through the layering, almost like breadcrumbing to get the functionality quickly moving between the sub scene tracks. So trying to open a nested storyboard sequence will crash Unreal Engine. So that's also worth noting. So just check your current engine version. This may not be the case, but just make sure you're saving your content as you go. It will be something good to do moving forward. So the sub scene tracks can then be expanded into given sub layers. So you may have, as we said before, this character animation track, for example, and then you may have sub sequences that are per character type, for example, you can get as granular or as high level as you want. So we just want to consider sub scene tracks for the various elements, just don't add sub scenes for your storyboards. As we mentioned before, that could cause some crashing for you. It's also worth noting that EPOS storyboarding does not support spawnable actors at this time. So if you see actors in your content browser or your world outliner that are like this, i.e. not got the lightning icons, then that's what you want. If you see any kind of cameras that are being spawned at runtime, which is what this lightning icon means, then EPOS isn't going to be aware of them. So you just want to add all the actors into your scene to be using with these sequences. And then maybe you want to set some useful hotkeys here. As you begin working with these tools more, you'll find your own workflow, but here are a few to get you started. And then we've got a couple more here. So just a quick note here, EPOS storyboarding requires the highlighted shortcut keys to be disabled or remapped. As we said at the start, it may just cause some conflicts with the default functionality. And then we've also got a couple more timeline tricks here if you want to just get more familiar with using a sequencer. And especially when you're editing a lot of shots, these kind of tools might help on that journey. So there's a good white paper to read here. Creating the Fortnite trailer, it just helps you understand the virtual production process of how the cinematics are created. And a few extra resources here for you to dig into. Some getting started guides and some documentation. And all this course today was credited by Kevin Miller, Brennan Carroll, Elodie Moog, and Fabrice de Berge. So thank you again for those.",
