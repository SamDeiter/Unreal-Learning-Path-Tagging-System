  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at lights and light properties when it comes to ray tracing. So let's get started. So the one thing I do want to point out is you want to make sure that all of your lights are movable. This is very important. And in here, I'm going to go ahead and go into Unreal and show you some of the things you need to take into account when it comes to ray tracing, because there are a few things you need to consider. So let's go ahead and jump right into Unreal. So in my scene here, I have a few types of lights in here that you can take a look at here. Now you'll notice I don't have a whole lot of noise, which is great. All that's really being controlled by my post process volume. And notice my post process volume is contained within a region. We'll go over that later. But I don't want to point that out because you will find out as you go from each one of these modules that the frame rate may drop or increase depending on where you go. The quality is a bit higher here, and that does help your light a bit. You'll notice for each light, if I click on it, you can actually go in here and activate ray tracing for your light. Now for some reason, you can't find it, but you just kind of go down. It's right below your lighting channels or just type in ray tracing. And you want to make sure this is active. Now by default, we have it active all the time since we're now having Lumen as our default when you start up Unreal. But if you're grabbing something from the marketplace, it's something to consider. So you'll notice some of the things that we may not need, and actually we don't need at all, is light mass. So don't worry about that because we are in a movable state. So light mass has really no effect or need in our light control. But we do have the ability to control samples per pixel. You can increase this for a better shadow quality if you need. Now this is really up to you. It usually works pretty well. But as you bump this up, you can get a little bit a better shadow quality, but it can be at the cost of frames and GPU. So let's talk about softening your shadows here for a second. This is a source radius high spotlight. And you'll notice we get a nice soft shadow. So it works just like your lights normally. And you'll see the one here, it is low and you'll see that we get a harder shadow. So if you don't quite remember where those are at, we can go back up to the light and you'll see our source radius here is set to zero. We click on the other one and you'll notice our source radius is set to 32. That'll soften up our shadows for us. You'll notice we also have a rec light here. This works really great. But if you want to soften those shadows, you do need to expand the size of this rec light versus also the intensity. So you just need to be a bit deterministic. One thing I do want to point out, we've improved this a little bit, but it's still something you do need to consider. As you move your light around, be careful not to shove them into objects, because that's just not good practice. Unreal doesn't know where the photons begin and end. So that's still a bit of an issue. We may have fixed it a little bit, but still you can see there's considerable noise as I do this. So don't do that. Don't put your lights inside of pieces of geometry. Again, Unreal doesn't know where the photons begin and end and it makes it hard to sort. You can also see a bit of noise here. Now this can be fixed with the post process volume, which we'll talk in just a bit. Now again, other lights that you can use, such as your point light, works exactly the same way, where we can go in here and control our soft source radius. As we soften it up, you can see it softens up our shadows. And we can also soften up our glow reflectivity. You can see we can do that with the source, soft source radius versus source radius. If I did misspeak, I apologize. Source radius for shadow softness, soft source radius for softer reflections. You can keep in mind that source part there with the soft. So we're basically changing the softness of the source. We also have source length, which we've talked about in other classes. We can change the shape of the light. So again, be careful not to shove lights into ground objects. You can get a bit more noise outside. You'll see a little bit less. So keep those things in mind. Now again, we need to make sure these lights are movable. They have to be movable. Otherwise, the calculation will be inaccurate. And Unreal will be wanting you to bake it, as you saw the error go away as I clicked on movable on this particular light. That's it with this lesson. In the next lesson, we're going to talk about post-process volume settings and what we can do to have better results. Thanks again.",
