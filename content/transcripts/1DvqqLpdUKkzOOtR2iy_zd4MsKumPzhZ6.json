  "text": " In this chapter, we're going to cover the overall file structure that you can experience when working with Unreal Engine. In particular, we're going to talk about various different projects and using pre-built templates. After you launch the editor, you'll be able to select a few of those. We'll talk about your project files, not only importing those files, but how those are stored and saved. We'll also talk about the project folders and then the overall structure of your project so you understand how to move your project and where the files reside. So when it comes to our projects, when you launch the editor, if you're not launching an actual project, but rather just launching the editor directly from the marketplace, you'll have the option of creating a new project or selecting the current project. Now, obviously, if you have a project order that's pre-existing, selecting makes sense. However, if you're creating a new project, you can select from some of these pre-built templates. Now, the thing to take note of is that when you select these pre-built templates, it's not like you're getting a different version of the engine. In fact, what you're doing when you activate or you use one of these templates is the template is pre-flagging certain settings inside of the engine, inside of your project to be able to match that industry spec. So, for example, if you were to use, say, for example, the virtual reality plugin, it would enable the virtual reality plugins as well as even give you the option of adding the virtual reality content at the start. So this can be very handy, especially if you just want to kind of get a jumpstart on working on your project. Now, again, the thing to keep in mind and take note of is, again, you don't have a special version of the engine when you do this. In fact, again, it's just flagging certain things and adding content that you absolutely can remove. You can add to existing projects, etc. So, again, if you're working on an existing project and you realize that you want to utilize some of the content from one of these templates, that is absolutely fine, completely possible. And again, even you can set these plugins and the different project settings to match the templates. So when it comes to working with project files, want to start with by just kind of explaining a little bit about basic file structure. So when you're working with programs outside of Unreal Engine, typically speaking, you work with a piece of software and it saves a particular file type. So, for example, we have Photoshop when we save our PSD files or Word to save doc files, Maya to save MB files. Now, this is slightly different when we're working with Unreal Engine. We can still ingest a lot of those external files into our project. So we're going to import things like models, textures, audio, animation, etc. And when we do that, the engine is going to convert those to .u assets. Additionally, when we save our maps, it'll save it as a .u map, and then our project will be saved as a .u project. It's important to note real fast here that you don't have to put your content into the project. So, for example, if you're storing, let's say, all of your textures on a separate location on your hard drive and you import them into the engine, the engine will automatically convert those to .u assets. And you don't have to send those textures with the project. All you need is just those u assets to share with the rest of your team and you're good to go. So again, to keep in mind that you can have your files reside elsewhere so your source files can be in a separate folder from your project. So when it comes to our project folder structure, again, most of what you're going to see inside of those files is a .u asset. That's perfect. That's all you need. In fact, you can share those with your team. You can use source control and version those. And that's all that you need to have with your project. You'll also see that typically most of your folder structure will have a .u project in the root of your project name. And then you'll also have a few other folders like config, content, intermediate, drive data cache, saved, etc. All of your content will then be stored inside of the content folder. Again, this is where you're going to access all of your information when you import your content. The simplest way to kind of represent this with our lovely Venn diagram is that if you think about all the individual components that you'll be adding to your scene, again, this can be audio, animation, textures, meshes. You can think about those as actors. With those actors, we will place them inside of our levels, our .u maps, and then we'll have everything residing in our .u map. And that .u project is what we'll share with our team and what we'll pass elsewhere. Of course, we can do that as well with individual actors, but that is the overall file structure of our project. All right. So now we're going to move on to talking about the basics of our content workflow.",
