  "text": " One last thing we're going to look at is how to attach something to a character, because so often in games and cinematics, a character might be wearing something or picking something up, equipping something, and this is essentially just a great thing to know how to do. So in the Engine, we do this using sockets. Now a socket is something that we add to the skeleton and it's parented to a bone and it just follows that bone wherever it goes. We'll then add the asset that we want to attach into our sequence. We'll reference the socket inside the sequence to attach the two together. Now in the sequence, we're going to use an attach track to do this attachment, but you can also use things like blueprint logic and events in the timeline to trigger those attachments. So let's add a socket to our skeleton first and then we can set that up in the sequence. So to find a skeleton for our character, I'm going to select the character that we have in the level, press Ctrl B, and that will browse to the asset in your content browser. If I was to open that up, we can then use the animation sub editor icon at the top here to find the skeleton that's connected to this character. So if I select that, this is now our skeleton that we're using and we've got our skeleton tree in the left hand side here. So I'm going to select probably spine four or spine five here. Let's go with spine five. I'll right click this and I will add a socket. And if we select the socket here, you can see if I change our preview settings, so character, bones and tick sockets here, you'll be able to see any sockets that we have on our character. So you can see we have one here. It'll be like some sort of item attachment socket and we've got the spine of five socket. So if I right click and rename our socket, we'll just call this backpack underscore socket because we're going to be attaching a backpack to our character. Now if we were to go back to our skeletal mesh and have a look in our skeleton tree, we should also see that socket there. If I save this, we don't, which is interesting. How about I close it and I open it again. There we go. So it's just refreshed now. So we can see our backpack socket here connected to our spine of five. So coming back to our sequence here, we can now add our backpack that we want to attach to the character and we can set up the attach track. I jump over to the content browser and if I just search for backpack and then click and hold the skeletal mesh version, hover over the sequencer tab and drop it into our sequencer window here. That'll bring it in. If I just minimise money to make this a bit clearer. To add an attach track, just over the item that you want to attach, hit the plus on the right hand side here, hover over attach and choose the asset that you want to attach it to. So if the asset that you want to attach it to is inside your sequence already, you can choose it from this existing binding heading. But if it's something that's in the level that's not in the sequence, you could go to new binding and choose that from your outliner here. But we want to attach it to money, so we'll just click that. And we can see here we've got a handful of sockets and all the joints of our character that we're able to attach this to. But we're just going to choose backpack socket because that's the one we set up to attach. Now you can see here that it has attached to our character and it's jumped up onto that socket. So as we scrub through and play, it's following our character around, but it doesn't look quite right. So it's, you know, halfway inside our character. Now we could correct this one of two ways. We could select the backpack and then come to frame zero here, set a key on the transform track and just move it out and reposition it to however we want the asset to look. But if this is something you're doing, you know, several times, then you don't really want to have to do this step every time. Or if you're doing it in Blueprint with an event, you don't want to have to set up any extra logic there. So we can actually change the default location of our backpack socket to account for this. So if we jump back to our skeleton socket here, we can see that we've got our socket selected and we can add a preview mesh to this. So we can see what a mesh might look like when it gets attached to the socket. So if I right click the socket and choose add preview asset, I can then search for backpack and that'll allow us to add it to, as a preview mesh to see what it looks like when it's attaching. Now, because we're using SKM Mani as our preview inside the sequence, I'm actually going to change our preview mesh here to match SKM Mani because his mesh is quite different from Quinn's mesh. And we want to know that we're working with the right mesh here. So if I select the backpack socket and just bring that out and reposition it to where we think the backpack looks good, I think that'll probably work for now. Straighten up a bit more. Once we come back out to, if I save that actually first, once we come back out to our sequence, we can see now that we kind of have a double offset because we have this transform track working at the same time. But we can see that there's definitely been a change and there's been an update to the location of this backpack. So with the backpack selected and the anim details here, I'm just going to hit this arrow to reset the property to the default values, which is just zero. And as you can see, it will snap back to the location that the socket is now in by default. So if I set a key just where we are now and delete that original key and drag this back to zero, you can see that when our character moves, our backpack is now attached to them in the correct location. And anytime that we attach this backpack, whether it's in Blueprint or whether it's in Sequencer, we know confidently that it's going to snap to the right place without us having to add any more transform offsets to that with like a transform track or any transform values that might need to be added after the attachment. So there it is. We've just seen how to create a new animation using Control Rig inside Sequencer. Also how to blend existing animations together to create something new and how to then save that animation asset to use elsewhere in the project. And also how you can then animate on top of a pre-existing animation non-destructively using a layered Control Rig. There's really so much more to learn about Control Rig and how animations work in Engine. And we have several different courses that go into great detail about how to create your own Control Rig and how to utilize all of the other animation tools in the Engine. So if there's more you want to learn about Control Rig and how to animate in the Engine, you should definitely go and check those out. I just wanted to share this last slide that has a couple of links that goes into a bit more detail about root motion in the Engine, as well as a link for more detailed breakdown about animation Blueprints and a link for any Blender add-ons that exist for the Unreal Engine. And just to wrap up, we've learned about the different types of animations in the Engine. And we now know how to import and export our characters and animations to and from the Engine. We have an understanding of the differences between skeletons and skeletal meshes and then a brief overview of the different animation sub-editors and what you could use those for. Then we actually created our own animation from scratch, as well as learning how to blend animations together to create new animations and how to attach these props to your characters using sockets. So thank you very much for listening. And remember to check out any of our other courses if you want to continue developing. And best of luck with your animations in the future.",
