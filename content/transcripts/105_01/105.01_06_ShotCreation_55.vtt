00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Creating a level sequence is a straightforward process and there are three methods you can deploy.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
By using the main toolbar and the Cinematics Clapboard button, you'll create a new level sequence,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
place that level sequence icon into your level, and it will open the level sequence in Sequencer for you automatically.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The next option is using the plus add button in the Content Browser.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Browse up to the Cinematics option and choose Level Sequence.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This will create a new level sequence, only place it in the Content Browser where you specify,

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and not immediately save the level sequence to your hard drive.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The final method is simply right-clicking in the Content Browser and creating a level sequence in the folder you're currently viewing in the Content Browser.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Like the previous method, Unreal will create the level sequence, but not immediately save the file.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Whether or not to add a level sequence to your actual level is a matter of choice.

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you do, they'll appear in the level as a clapboard to give an indication to other teammates working on your project

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that this level sequence is tied to a particular level.

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Selecting it and seeing the details in the Details window will allow you to open the level sequence and do other additional tasks.

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Once a level sequence has been created, you can populate Sequencer with Skeletal or Static Mesh Actors, Lights or Cameras,

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and provide animation sequences to your actors and keyframes on control rigs and transform tracks.

16
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Fade tracks are also available to fade in and fade out of your sequence from any color you choose.

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Right-clicking over the fade track will bring up the Properties field to set various attributes, or you could use the Select Details menu.

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
With all of this information, you're armed and ready to start creating something amazing.

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's move on to our next module where we'll conduct a practical exercise.
