00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
Using a game engine for linear animation can be intimidating for the uninitiated.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.179
It requires learning new terminology that the average DCC software user is unlikely

3
00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.000
to be familiar with.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.660
Being very modular in nature, Unreal breaks down its world construction and animation

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.740
features with an array of new technical engine terms that unfortunately have no equivalent

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.980
in classical digital film production.

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.660
These terms are directly related to the process of building a game, but once you learn them,

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.899
you'll come to appreciate their capabilities and logic.

9
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.100
Static meshes and scale meshes describe different types of actors based on whether they have

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.740
a joint-based deformable geometry.

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.079
Unreal also uses different terms for objects in the scene, like actors, pawns, and characters.

12
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.900
The environment is described in terms of the world, maps, levels, and sub-levels.

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.799
Control rigs are like animation rigs.

14
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.359
Terms are used for triggering specific actions or different visual looks.

15
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.079
Blueprints are a visual scripting system, and source control is a way to check data in and

16
00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.000
out of your project using a server depot.

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.479
However, Sequencer's feature set attempts to mirror some of the terminology you're

18
00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:24.039
more familiar with in film production, like scene assemblies, takes, layout, shots, and sequences.

19
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.400
It's not a coincidence that Sequencer's level sequence and assembly structure bears

20
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.200
a certain similarity to the organization of film production.

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.880
A typical film is broken down into acts, sequences, scenes, shots, and takes.

22
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.600
Each unit is smaller than the last, and they effectively are nested inside of one another.

23
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.320
On the Unreal side, Sequencer is designed to replicate film structure by using level sequences.

24
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.119
These actors can create levels of organization through nesting level sequences into one another.

25
00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.799
This will allow organizational control over scenes, actors, cameras, lights, keyframes,

26
00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399
and other technical capabilities.

27
00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.680
Since level sequences are essentially virtual containers, they are capable of handling

28
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.199
greater and greater orders of animation complexity as more level sequences are added to them.

29
00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.439
For new users, it can be confusing to realize that the level sequence actor can accommodate

30
00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.439
so many different tasks while still being called a level sequence.

31
00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.719
You may hear me say things like level sequence shot, or level sequence sequence, but they're

32
00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.439
all level sequence actors being used in different ways.

33
00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.639
Try not to be confused by the words level sequence.

34
00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.359
As promised, here's an example of what a nested level sequence looks like so we can

35
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.200
compare it to what you'll be constructing in a single level sequence during the hands-on

36
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960
exercise.

37
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.040
It consists of a parent level sequence with multiple level sequence shots inside of it.

38
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.000
The parent level sequence can possess multiple level sequence shots through the use of a

39
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.600
shot track.

40
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:11.240
Level sequence shots can be moved, they can be trimmed, or have their play rate altered.

41
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.640
You can even generate new takes of shots by using our take system.

42
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.400
And if you'd like, you can add a fade track to fade up from black.

43
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.920
The structure of a nested level sequence can be nearly anything, especially for game construction

44
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.240
purposes, but for cinematics and linear content creation there are usually some core ingredients.

45
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.520
Inside each level sequence shot, you'll have level actors like props or characters to

46
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520
animate.

47
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.040
A minimum of one camera per nested level sequence is needed, whether it's spawnable or possessible.

48
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.360
And most importantly, you'll need a camera cuts track to generate footage.

49
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.760
When played in sequence, the parent level sequence pulls camera binding data from each

50
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.520
shot's camera cuts track so it knows which camera it's looking through and what needs

51
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.520
to be rendered.

52
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.680
The result is a continuous sequence when played back through the timeline.

53
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.439
As impressive as nested level sequences are, you might not need so much complexity.

54
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.660
With a single camera cuts track and a single level sequence, users can construct long animated

55
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.199
takes and assign cuts to the camera cuts track to meet their needs.

56
00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.639
If multiple cameras are added into the level sequence, that long animated take can easily

57
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.879
turn into a master shot with coverage cameras being placed throughout the scene and bound

58
00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:38.399
to the camera cuts track to create an engaging sequence where continuity is easily preserved.

59
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:46.399
Let's take a look.

60
00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:52.120
Now inside of this 105.1 example, you'll see that I have three cinematic cameras.

61
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120
You'll only have two.

62
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.439
I've added the third for demonstration purposes.

63
00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:02.120
But these three cinematic cameras, camera one, camera two, and camera three, they're all

64
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.840
bound to the cinematic camera cuts track at specific points in time.

65
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.780
Camera one, camera two, and camera three.

66
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.959
If I want an additional fourth shot, it's just a matter of clicking on the plus button

67
00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.319
and adding a new binding.

68
00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.040
I'll go to camera one.

69
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.319
Now you'll also see that I have this gray box in here.

70
00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.800
This is what's called a camera blend and it can be activated here.

71
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.400
The camera blend basically blends the position of two cinematic cameras between shots and

72
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.400
the camera cuts track.

73
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:48.680
Let's take a look and see what this looks like.

74
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.560
Now this method of level sequence assembly does have its trade offs.

75
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.240
The level sequence can become crowded with so many actors and cameras and other effects

76
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.400
that it can become cumbersome to organize.

77
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.480
Plus in animation and VFX workflows, it's usually necessary to break down things into

78
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.519
separate shots for logistical purposes.

79
00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.480
So a lot of times it all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

80
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.420
Okay, this completes this demonstration.

81
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.439
Let's move on to our next module.
