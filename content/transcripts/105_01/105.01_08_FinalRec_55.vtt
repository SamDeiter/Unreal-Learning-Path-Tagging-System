00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As we wrap up this course, I'd like to point out that animation production with a game engine is a challenging but rewarding process.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sequencer's feature set is designed to address many production requirements, however, there are many things that you can do to make your experience in engine a more productive one.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The first thing you can do is to concentrate on project and level organization.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Unreal, as a game engine, is designed to achieve real-time results within the limits of existing GPU hardware.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Unlike traditional production that usually has much more computational resources, you should go into your project prepared with a plan to optimize your environments and animation performances for greater efficiency based on your GPU's capabilities.

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
By learning how to use a game engine, you're effectively becoming a better production artist.

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Most linear content projects rely on large environments and multiple scene setups for shot-based workflows.

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
One of the ways that Epic addresses this issue is by using levels and sub-levels, whereas game productions will likely use world partitions for open-world game play.

9
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The level editor is a critical tool for organizing your environment by creating specific sub-levels.

10
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The primary level or map that pairs to your master level sequence will contain what is known as the persistent level.

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
By default, everything resides here, including anything new added to the level, but once artists start creating additional sub-levels, they're more free to assign different purposes to them.

12
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
By double-clicking on any one of these additional sub-levels, newly added actors can be placed within them.

13
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Depending upon your particular project, levels and sub-levels can be used for environmental organization, sequence lighting setups, effects, special camera moves, or whatever you need.

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then within Sequencer, these levels can be turned on or off by using visibility tracks.

15
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The result allows the artist to selectively visualize portions of the environment on a scene-by-scene basis.

16
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Another technique to help keep yourself and your project running smoothly is to create a logically organized nested folder structure within your content browser and project outliner as much as possible.

17
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
While some studios do have their own organizational techniques, many do not.

18
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Lack of a common folder structure can make it difficult to hand off projects to other members on your team.

19
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A considerable amount of time is wasted by artists trying to dissect other people's work.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Make it easier on them and adopt this technique, especially if you're working within a group.

21
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Project organization remains one of the most important aspects of any production.

22
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In order to improve your chances of success, Epic has collected a number of relevant production tips and resources that can help you along the way.

23
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We'll take a look at those in our next session.
