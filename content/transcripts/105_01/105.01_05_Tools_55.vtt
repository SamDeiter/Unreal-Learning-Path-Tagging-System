1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
Unreal has a number of powerful tools, but probably the most important one to emphasize

2
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.419
for Sequencer is its camera tools.

3
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.540
Unreal leverages two primary types of cameras.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.160
The Cinemate Camera Actor is the camera of choice for creating sequences and shots for

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.820
cinematic creation or film production.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.699
It's designed to emulate a physical camera while maintaining features that allow control

7
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.179
over the film back, lens, focus, tracking, and post-processes.

8
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.200
The Game Camera Actor is the preferred camera for games because of its simplicity.

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.079
Intended for use as the player's view camera, additional cinematic controls are unnecessary.

10
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.460
To place a cinematic camera into your level, go to the Place Actors tab, choose Cine, and

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.539
then drag a Cinemate Camera Actor into your scene.

12
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.899
This will give you a possessible camera.

13
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.740
If you're wanting a spawnable camera, you can choose to use the Create Camera button

14
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.140
in Sequencer's UI.

15
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Once available, you'll be able to see the range of cinematic settings in the Details

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.740
Editor.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.460
Camera binding information can be found by looking in the priority information within

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.340
the Camera Cuts track or by using the Selection Details window.

19
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.859
The primary settings of the Cinemate Camera that are important to note are, film back

20
00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.500
presets with options to manually alter the sensor size, lens settings like focal length,

21
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.900
f-stop, squeeze factor, and diaphragm blade count.

22
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.820
These settings are available for setting manual focus distance, a debug focus plane,

23
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.060
and focus offsets, and tracking settings allow for look at tracking.

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.500
Finally, post-process settings allow the camera to have specialized effects like color grading,

25
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.180
film grain, and other more advanced render settings.

26
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.620
You might have noticed that whenever a Cinemate Camera Actor is added to Sequencer for the

27
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.580
first time, a Camera Cuts track is automatically generated.

28
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.939
The Camera Cuts track is responsible for binding specific cameras to edited cuts within Sequencer's

29
00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.019
timeline.

30
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.099
Remember that the Selection Details panel or the property settings within the Camera Cuts

31
00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:10.659
track can give you access to the binding ID or special blueprint conditions.

32
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.099
There are also different variations of camera components.

33
00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.020
The Scene Capture Component 2D captures a live snapshot of the scene from any camera

34
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.979
and feeds it to a rendered target texture.

35
00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:27.579
Think of it like a broadcast camera that beams an image to a receiving television set.

36
00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.819
The Cinic Capture Component 2D is just like the Scene Capture Component 2D, but includes

37
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.259
all the powers and capabilities of a Cinematic Camera.

38
00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.979
Things like post-processing, OCIO, and lens distortion are supported.

39
00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.699
The VCAM Actor is used to transmit camera motion and control settings remotely through

40
00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:52.500
the LiveLink plugin, and lens components are used to create calibrated lens files to match

41
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.780
physical camera conditions and apply lens distortions.

42
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.739
Welcome to my camera demo.

43
00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.259
In order to access the Cinematic Camera, go to the Place Actors tab and choose Cine.

44
00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:09.620
Here you'll find several tools associated with the Cinematic Camera, including the Cinematic

45
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.939
Camera itself.

46
00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.620
If you click and drag a Cinematic Camera into your level, you'll create a possessible

47
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.460
camera that you'll have to separately add into Sequencer.

48
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.099
If you only need a spawnable camera, then click on the Create Camera button in the Sequencer

49
00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.020
UI, and a camera will be added along with its Camera Cuts track.

50
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.500
I've created a quick little demo to showcase some of the most used camera settings.

51
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.939
You won't have this level in your file, but it's quite easy to set up.

52
00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.180
Just a couple of cubes and a few keyframes, and you're done.

53
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.060
Now I've split the viewport into two panes.

54
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.599
The pane on the left is what is known as the Cinematic Viewport.

55
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.879
This viewport shows you exactly what the camera or camera cuts track is seeing.

56
00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.819
It also provides you with some extra functionality, like some overlays, some masking features,

57
00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.740
and transport controls to help you with your cinematic choices.

58
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.900
The view on the right, this is the default viewport.

59
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.939
This viewport I've set up as my God Camera, and it allows me to observe the entire scene

60
00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.980
objectively, so it can be very helpful when planning out my action.

61
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.699
And if we select on a camera, over here on the right, we'll find the Details panel where

62
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.939
all the settings are located.

63
00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.500
We'll take a look at the focus settings, the look at settings, the focal length, and current

64
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.100
aperture fields.

65
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.580
Okay, let's get started.

66
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
All digital cameras use an electronic sensor to capture images, and those sensors are measured

67
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.700
in millimeters.

68
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.480
Unreal provides you with a range of different camera options in this drop-down menu.

69
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.060
By selecting a different setting, you're altering the dimensions of the camera sensor.

70
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.300
This will result in a different aspect ratio.

71
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.220
If your camera isn't listed, you can simply insert your camera sensor measurements in

72
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.780
the custom height and width fields.

73
00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.779
If you're attempting to replicate a traditional film camera's aperture dimensions, remember,

74
00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.539
they're measured in inches, so you'll have to convert to metric.

75
00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.339
For lensing options, Unreal does have a small selection of primes and a universal zoom setting.

76
00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.219
The custom setting allows you to set your min, max, focal length, and f-stops.

77
00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.219
A squeeze factor and diaphragm blade count settings are also available if you're trying

78
00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.099
to emulate anamorphic lenses or attempting to modify the bokeh.

79
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.780
Also, the current focal length field allows you to change your focal length and the resulting

80
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.980
horizontal field of view accordingly.

81
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.939
Unreal supports four different focus modes.

82
00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.939
Use Do Not Override to prevent altering post-process volume settings.

83
00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.580
Manual focus for setting a specific focus distance.

84
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.939
Tracking for tracking actors and disable to turn everything focus-related off.

85
00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.420
If you happen to be looking for that fancy depth of field effect, a lot depends on which

86
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.540
film back you're using, the focal length, and the value of your current aperture setting.

87
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.259
However, in general, the lower the aperture number, the shallower the depth of field.

88
00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.300
The higher the number, the deeper the depth of field.

89
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.060
If you're focusing on something close to the camera, the aperture will dictate how

90
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.259
in-focus things will be in the distance.

91
00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:26.659
I'd recommend using values aligned with the classic F-stop numbers, F1 through F22, F1

92
00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.459
for a blurry background, and F22 for the sharpest.

93
00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.899
Regarding focus, we can manually set our focus distance by typing in a distance measurement

94
00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:39.379
or by using the eyedropper tool.

95
00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.579
You can select actors in your level and the focus distance will be changed.

96
00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:48.219
Be sure to do this in the window that is actively piloting your camera, otherwise this functionality

97
00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.939
will not work.

98
00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:54.540
If you turn on the Debug Focus Plane option, you can see exactly where the focal plane

99
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.459
will be placed.

100
00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.939
Next, focus tracking can be used to track an object in order to set the focus.

101
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:07.019
Simply activate Focus Tracking and select your focusing object to track.

102
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:15.180
In my animated example, the cube remains in focus as it travels up and down the road.

103
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.220
Look at tracking is also available.

104
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.260
Just select your desired actor to track and this function will lock on to its pivot point.

105
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:29.100
If necessary, you can supply offset values to move the look at point if required.

106
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.420
The Cine Camera is a very robust tool and there are so many settings that we could explore,

107
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.260
but for now, you have some of the most important basics to start creating some interesting shots.

108
00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.300
Let's move on to our next module.
