00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
Hello everyone, and welcome to today's Quick Start class on Sequencer Shot Creation.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.279
My name is Brian Poole, and I'll be your authorized Unreal instructor throughout this

3
00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:11.279
course.

4
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.960
Here's a quick look at what we'll be covering today.

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.960
In exploring Sequencer fundamentals, we'll examine some core concepts of Sequencer's

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.440
capabilities like what is Sequencer, what's a level sequence, and we'll discuss actor

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.359
persistence types.

8
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.359
That will be followed by an examination of core structures in Sequencer, we'll define

9
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.799
a few terms, and we'll compare Unreal Sequencer to the structure of film production.

10
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:41.719
In Sequencer features and tools, we'll take a look at Sequencer's interface, discuss

11
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.799
event management, curve editing, and set up a level sequence template.

12
00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.760
Plus, we'll spend some time learning about Unreal cameras, their components, and primary

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.799
feature sets.

14
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.640
In hands-on shot creation and assembly, this section will focus on how to actually set

15
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.239
up a level sequence assembly and how it ties into the camera cuts track, followed by a

16
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.519
practical exercise.

17
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.280
And in final recommendations, we'll talk about level organization, folder structures,

18
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.159
and Sequencer best practices.

19
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.079
And then we'll look into some potential tips and resources.

20
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.159
Alright, let's get started.

21
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.840
Today's class will be utilizing the SEQ-10501 map level.

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.560
In the SEQ-90501-55 project file, it can be downloaded under content, courses, course

23
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.060
maps.

24
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.960
The project file you've downloaded contains items associated with four different courses.

25
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.439
We'll be examining the course SEQ-10501.

26
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.840
Our goal for this course is to start familiarizing ourselves with Sequencer and understanding

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.800
the basics of creating multiple shots within a single level sequence.

28
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.399
This project will utilize a level, contain a character, two cameras, and a camera cuts

29
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.719
track.

30
00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.120
This first approach is the more simplistic of two Sequencer assembly methods where the

31
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.599
second method leverages multiple nested level sequences.

32
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.159
We'll get into more in-depth on nested level sequences during another course.

33
00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.639
However, I'll promise you a sneak peek into what a nested level sequence setup looks like

34
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.000
just so you can understand the difference.

35
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800
Once you've downloaded the zip file and extracted its contents, you should see the

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.840
SEQ-90501-55 project file.

37
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.120
This file was created in Unreal 5.5, so if you have an earlier version of the engine,

38
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120
you should upgrade.

39
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.920
If you have a later version of Unreal, you'll have to convert the project file to Unreal

40
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.800
5.6 by following the prompts Unreal provides for you upon launching this project.

41
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.159
Now, the primary map should load automatically, but in case it doesn't, let's take a look

42
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.639
as to where you can find it.

43
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.060
Inside the contents folder, there is the courses folder.

44
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.280
This folder contains the course maps folder.

45
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.599
Within here, you'll find maps for all four courses within this project.

46
00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.879
In case your level didn't open upon launch, let's double click on the SEQ-10501 map.

47
00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.319
This will bring you into rural Australia.

48
00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.719
Now, if you take a look around, this is really a great map, and it has some very realistic

49
00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.719
models and textures.

50
00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.240
What's even better is that it's highly optimized to run on most computers and GPUs with ease.

51
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.039
This map can be found in FAB in case you're interested in having it within your own library.

52
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:31.280
Now, if you're curious as to where the assets are for this level, they're located within

53
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.199
the assets folder.

54
00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.479
There is a rural Australia folder, and it contains all of the individual component parts.

55
00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:44.119
If we look over here in the Outliner, everything is nicely organized into folders and named

56
00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.879
beautifully with a dedicated naming convention.

57
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.079
Now, the level sequence we'll be examining and ultimately recreating is located in the

58
00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.000
course folder.

59
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.039
You'll navigate to the SEQ-105 folder, and then open course topics, and finally the

60
00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.280
camera cuts folder.

61
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.000
Our level sequence is seq-cinicam-ex.

62
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.079
Now, if you'd like to take a look, double-click on the level sequence icon.

63
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.959
This will open the Sequencer UI and allow you to view the sequence by clicking on the

64
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.160
camera icon in the camera cuts track, and then by pressing play.

65
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.240
So click on this button, and press play.

66
00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:42.039
Now this will show you two cameras being tied together through a camera blend in the camera

67
00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.119
cuts track, but more on this later.

68
00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:49.559
In our next module, we'll take a look at some core concepts behind Sequencer and understand

69
00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.719
the theory of how Sequencer fundamentals operate.
