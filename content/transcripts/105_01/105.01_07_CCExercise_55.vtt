00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
To best utilize Sequencer for creating linear animation, you must understand what the Camera

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.160
Cuts track is used for.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.839
In a nutshell, the Camera Cuts track is responsible for binding specific cinematic cameras to

4
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.800
the level sequence, so Unreal knows which camera to render.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.080
It can also act as a simple non-linear editor.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
In our example, we have a simple two-camera sequence with a camera blend.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
We're going to take this one step further by adding a third camera and a cut on the

8
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.359
Camera Cuts track.

9
00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.799
Any time you start a new project, its success or failure largely depends on how organized

10
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:38.799
you are.

11
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.320
Sequencer is no different.

12
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.359
To start, let's make sure you have the 105.01 map properly loaded.

13
00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.920
This is your level.

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.079
Go to the course maps folder to find the file and double click on it to load it.

15
00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.759
Next, you'll need to make your working directory.

16
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:04.359
To do this, right-click in the course topics folder and select create new folder.

17
00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:08.719
Since there is already a Camera Cuts folder present, make another folder and call it something

18
00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.879
similar.

19
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:13.359
Double click on the folder and it will immediately open.

20
00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:18.079
Next, you're going to need a level sequence.

21
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.479
Inside the content browser, right-click and go to cinematics in the pop-up contextual menu.

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.760
Select create level sequence.

23
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.280
Call this seq cinnyc underscore ex2.

24
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.640
Once that's done, double click on the icon and open Sequencer.

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.640
Next, you're going to need to create a new Cinic Camera.

26
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
Use the Camera Create button in Sequencer's toolbar and add the camera.

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.320
This will generate a Camera Cuts track and a spawnable camera.

28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.280
Rename the camera cinicam underscore 01 underscore sh01.

29
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.400
You can pilot the camera by pressing the Camera Pilot button.

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.560
It will turn blue when it's active.

31
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.039
Next, you'll need to add actors to Sequencer.

32
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:20.159
Since the original 101 map doesn't include an SK mannequin in the level, we must find

33
00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.159
one and place it there.

34
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.560
Go to the content browser and navigate to the assets folder.

35
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.039
Open it and then continue to the mannequin folder and inside that you'll find a character

36
00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.719
and mesh folder.

37
00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.239
You want the SK mannequin mesh in the mesh folder.

38
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.919
Click and drag this into your level.

39
00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.919
Return to Sequencer and with Mani selected, click the plus add button.

40
00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:51.599
Then go to add actor to Sequencer and choose add SK mannequin.

41
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.919
Once in Sequencer, right click over Mani in the Sequencer Outliner and convert the selected

42
00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:02.159
binding to spawnable.

43
00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.599
Next we need to add animation to the actor.

44
00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.919
Since we'll be using animation sequences, we must remove the control rig.

45
00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.560
Select the control rig and delete it.

46
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.319
Don't worry, you can always get it back later.

47
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.680
Next we'll want to zero out Mani's transformations in the details panel.

48
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.680
We need to do this because the motion capture data is offset by several units from 000.

49
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.000
Click on the plus button in the animation track and add the animation sequence called

50
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.520
ManiAnimTrack.

51
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.480
Mani should pop into place near the road sign.

52
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.479
Now we need to adjust the staging and shot duration.

53
00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.039
This will extend our sequence length.

54
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:52.199
Click in the range slider field on the right and change the value to 350.

55
00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.920
This is a little bit more than what we need, but we'll fix that.

56
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.120
Next enter the frame value in the time slider or scrub the slider to frame 256 and click

57
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.000
on the red right bracket button.

58
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.360
Our sequence is now 256 frames long.

59
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.120
To accommodate this, the camera cuts track must also be extended.

60
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.639
Grab the right side of the film strip and drag it out to the red out marker.

61
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:29.800
Finally, press the home button on your keyboard to center the timeline.

62
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.439
Now we need to create some additional cine cameras.

63
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.000
We're going to need a second and third camera so you can use the create camera button again

64
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.079
to create two more spawnable cameras and name them Cinecam02 underscore SH02 and Cinecam03

65
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:54.160
underscore SH03.

66
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.199
Once that's done, you're going to have to move your cameras into place.

67
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.319
Pilot your cameras 1, 2, and 3 into position.

68
00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.199
Make sure you're using the pilot button so you can fly your camera directly into position

69
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.399
and frame accordingly.

70
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:51.839
Next, we must bind the cameras to our camera cuts track.

71
00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.199
The first camera you created is automatically bound to the camera cuts track.

72
00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.599
We need to bind the other two.

73
00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.519
Shot one is approximately 52 frames long, so move your time marker to frame 52 and press

74
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.199
the plus button on the camera cuts track.

75
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.959
Select camera two.

76
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:16.599
Shot two runs about 130 frames, so move your time marker again and press the plus button

77
00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.639
to add camera three.

78
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.680
Finally, you might want to make a decision regarding focus.

79
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.000
You can choose to disable your focus on all cameras to keep everything in focus, or you

80
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.599
can use the manual focus feature and the eyedropper tool to select Manny and keep him in focus.

81
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.200
Once you're satisfied, we'll move on to the final step.

82
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.920
To create a camera blend, right click over the camera cuts track and sequencers outliner.

83
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.120
Go up to the camera blend feature and activate it.

84
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:56.439
Now, go back to sequencer and click and drag on shot two and drag it over shot one.

85
00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.160
This is going to take some experimentation to get right, but find your timing and choose

86
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.800
an option blending curve that meets your expectations.

87
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.480
To review your work, click on the camera icon in the camera cuts track and you'll see exactly

88
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.600
what the cameras are seeing in the sequence.

89
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600
That's it!

90
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600
Great job!

91
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.760
You've constructed your first sequence.

92
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.480
Imagine all of the possibilities you can now create.

93
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.000
Okay, it's time to move on to our final mod and discuss some recommendations.
