As of the date of this recording, Epic has assembled a number of tips and resources that

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.120
can provide you with the extra technical information and workflow suggestions designed to improve

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.320
your knowledge of the engine.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.420
When you factor in third-party websites, authorized Unreal instructor platforms, and

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.080
Unreal partners, the number becomes far too many to list in this presentation.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.480
However, here are a few simple sequencer tips and resources that you can use to get yourself

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760
underway.

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.039
Within Sequencer, the following tips will help improve your efficiency.

9
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.439
Right middle mouse button and drag will pan the timeline horizontally and vertically.

10
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.640
Shift and scroll will also pan the timeline.

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.439
Control and scroll is used for zooming the timeline.

12
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.200
Alt shift right mouse drag can be used for freeform zooming around the time marker, and

13
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.120
pressing the home key on your keyboard will reset the range slider bounds.

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.820
Control drag on the time bar and moving the mouse to the right will define a specific

15
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.280
zoom region, whereas control drag on the time bar to the left will reset the zoom region.

16
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.320
There are also a number of hotkeys that can come in handy for setting keyframes, centering

17
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:27.519
your timeline, and duplicating selected items.

18
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:31.599
If you have specific technical questions, the Unreal developers website is a great place

19
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:37.000
to start in order to find a number of resources including engine documentation and video-related

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.599
content.

21
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.959
Epic also provides a number of links within the slide deck for you to explore.

22
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.079
Take some time and take a look.

23
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.519
This concludes our quick start for Sequencer Shot creation.

24
00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.239
I hope you learned something and enjoyed this class.

25
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.599
Thank you.
