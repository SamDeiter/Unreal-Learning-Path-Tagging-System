00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome back. Let's take a little time to explore some sequencer fundamentals.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.320
First up, some core concepts.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.080
So what is sequencer? Simply put, it's Unreal Engine's non-linear editor and animation assembly

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
tool designed to supply users with the production tools they'll need to produce animation, trigger

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.760
various events like blueprints code, and smoothly transition between gameplay and linear animated

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.679
content.

7
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.920
Sequencer is commonly deployed to build shots, generate pre-visualization, manage animation

8
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.560
in Unreal, and construct film sequences and game cinematics.

9
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.520
From a workflow perspective, sequencer leverages actors on the level and gives them a set of

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.719
instructions. But as the director, you must cast which actors are going to be used. Actors

11
00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.240
can be added to sequencer through the Outliner or Content Browser to create level sequence

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.679
assemblies. A level sequence assembly is essentially a populated level sequence.

13
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.120
So what's a level sequence? Essentially, it's a virtual data container. It stores various

14
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.640
actors and their associated attributes, keyframe data, lights, cameras, and other edit information.

15
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.760
Level sequences can also contain other level sequences to create nested hierarchies capable

16
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.560
of replicating film sequences, shots, and departmental organization. They're represented

17
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.719
in the level as a traditional clapboard icon, and in sequencer itself, level sequences are

18
00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.200
represented as traditional film strips similar to what you'd see in a non-linear editing

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800
application like Adobe Premiere.

20
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.200
Speaking of non-linear editors, sequencer is also capable of exporting edit decision lists

21
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.320
and XLM data to synchronize sequencer and your third-party non-linear editor together.

22
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.600
As you begin your journey into creating content and Unreal, one of the first concepts you'll

23
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.719
need to learn is the idea of actor persistence within your environment, or in Unreal what

24
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.760
we call the level or sub-level. Essentially, Unreal has three different ways actors can

25
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.920
be controlled in sequencer. This control determines when actors are available to the animator

26
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:14.000
for animating and how long they'll persist in the level over time. Today, we're going

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.199
to primarily examine two forms of persistence, possessibles and spawnable actors.

28
00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.939
Possessible actors persist in the level indefinitely and can be controlled or shared by multiple

29
00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.000
level sequences. If you know you have specific actors or characters that will be used regularly,

30
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.319
keeping them as possessibles makes sense for ease of access and repetitious use. It should

31
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.539
be noted, however, that possessible characters can only be controlled by one level sequence

32
00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:49.159
at a time. Spawnable actors only exist within the active level sequence. They're identified

33
00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.000
in sequencer and the outliner by a lightning bolt icon. This type of persistence is excellent

34
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.240
for temporary actors who are needed for specific needs within the shot. Perhaps some extra

35
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.919
lights or a background actor who shows up just for that shot and then is no longer needed.

36
00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.479
The idea of the spawnable is appealing because it can keep your level and its environment

37
00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:15.959
free of unnecessary actors when they're no longer needed. The last type of persistence

38
00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.199
is replaceable actors. This is a blueprint-driven form of persistence and it's dictated by

39
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:27.359
the binding lifetime track and it allows you to swap out actors within sequencer as needed.

40
00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.519
So let's switch over to the engine and take a look at how these concepts work.

41
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.920
Alright, if you haven't loaded SEQ-10501's map, go ahead and do so at this time. And

42
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.840
when you do, you'll find that this level has a number of actors in it. We have a road,

43
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.280
a road sign, a fence, some trees, and even a motorcycle. Anything that's been placed

44
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.280
into this level has the potential of becoming a possessible actor if it's brought into

45
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.760
sequencer. Whatever it is, sequencer can possess that actor and give it instructions beyond

46
00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:04.959
the actor's original attributes when in this level. Once the level sequence is done with

47
00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.039
it, the possessible actor returns to its default state as it originally was within the level.

48
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:17.719
So take this road sign, for example. In the level, it's located in a very specific place.

49
00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:23.240
I can take this level actor and bring it into sequencer as a possessible, so let's do that.

50
00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:29.319
We'll go to content, we'll create cinematics, level sequence, and we'll call this LS test.

51
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.360
Double click on the icon and you'll bring up the sequencer UI. Now what I'm going to do is I'm

52
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.319
going to add a shot track. Now I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself in that the shot track is a

53
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:48.000
little bit more of an advanced concept. It allows you to nest level sequences inside of a level

54
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.600
sequence. I'm going to show it to you for the sake of understanding persistence. So I'm going to

55
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.160
click on the button and say create new shot. This will be called shot 1001 and I'll click save.

56
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.639
Now you'll get this film strip looking thing here inside of the level sequence. This represents the

57
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:15.639
level sequence shot 0010 underscore 01. And I'm going to retime this level sequence, trim it down

58
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.639
a little bit, make it a certain length. And then I'm going to press the shot button again and

59
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:32.120
create another shot. This one will call shot 20. Again, I'm going to retime this and put it later

60
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:42.319
in the LS test level sequences timeline. Alright, so these two level sequences now exist, but they're

61
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.759
currently empty. There's nothing in them. So if I were to basically double click on this level

62
00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:54.040
sequence, we'll enter it and you can see there's nothing in here. But I'm going to take the road

63
00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:02.879
sign. I'm going to add it actor to sequencer. And now it is going to be able to be possessed by this

64
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.680
level sequence. And I'm going to give it a set of instructions of what I want it to do. So in this

65
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.519
particular case, all I want to do is just push it down into the ground. And if I go back to level

66
00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:22.040
sequence test, as long as my time marker is in this level sequence, the road sign will be down in

67
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.840
the ground. But if I go outside of this level sequence, it'll return back to its default position.

68
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.160
Alright, so let's go over to shot 20. And if I double click on this, take the road side again,

69
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.480
and add it to this level sequence. I'm going to do something different. So I'm going to basically

70
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.880
give it some animation. I'll move it to the middle of the road. I'll rotate it 180 degrees. And I'll

71
00:06:49.880 --> 00:07:00.920
set a keyframe. Alright, and then I'll move the time marker down. And I'll push the road sign down

72
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.960
the road and set another keyframe. So now I have some animation. So when I go back to level sequence

73
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:15.800
test, these two level sequences now have active components in it. And it will possess this road

74
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.800
sign to tell it what to do. So here we are in shot 20, it's animating. In shot 10, it's pushed down

75
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:30.680
into the ground. So if I move these level sequences into an order that I want. And I press play,

76
00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:40.280
we'll see what happens. Down, default, down the road. Now, these level sequences can be shuffled. I

77
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.840
can move them into a different order. I could place shot 20 first. And we'll go down the road

78
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.360
first, go back to default, and then go down into the ground. The other thing about these level

79
00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.040
sequences is whatever level sequence is on top takes priority. So in this particular instance,

80
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.520
the level sequence shot 20 may be animating it down the road. But as soon as it hits shot 10,

81
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:13.000
it will jump down and be pushed into the ground. So this is how possessibles work. The level sequence

82
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.960
basically possesses the level actor and gives it a set of instructions on what to do. Now, let's take

83
00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:29.599
a look at something different. If we go into courses, Seq 105.01 and go to course topics,

84
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:38.399
camera cuts, and we load the Seq Sync cam example level sequence. Immediately, you're going to see

85
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:46.039
that we get a mani and two sync cameras. Now, where did they come from? Well, if you look down in

86
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.439
Sequencer, you can see that they have the lightning bolt icon next to them. This means that they're

87
00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:59.079
spawnable. And in this case, for this level sequence, they've been spawned into existence. And

88
00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:03.319
they're here to do whatever it is they're going to do. For mani's case, he's going to animate,

89
00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:10.199
walk towards the sign. And these cameras have some specific camera blends that are happening,

90
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:17.800
which we'll see soon in a minute. So this level sequence, let's see what happens when we put

91
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.280
this level sequence into another level sequence. Let's go back to the content browser. We'll go

92
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:31.720
and load the LS test. And we'll get rid of these two level sequences. And in this case, we'll add

93
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:46.519
the Seq Sync cam example. Now, here is that level sequence as if it were a shot. And if I move my

94
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:54.040
time marker, there's nothing in this level that I see so far. But as I move, and it hits that level

95
00:09:54.039 --> 00:10:01.480
sequence, mani and the two synic cameras are spawned into this level. And they'll remain there

96
00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:08.839
until this level sequence is complete. And then they'll just go away. Now this can be at a big

97
00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:17.879
advantage in the sense that spawnables can keep my level free of clutter. And they are good for

98
00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:25.000
adding in actors or extra lights or extra cameras, as you need them for the specific shot. So they

99
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
can be a big advantage that way. All right, so this concludes this particular demonstration of

100
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.679
what a possessible is and what a spawnable is. We're going to move on now to our next module,

101
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:40.360
which is going to be on core structures within Unreal Sequencer.
