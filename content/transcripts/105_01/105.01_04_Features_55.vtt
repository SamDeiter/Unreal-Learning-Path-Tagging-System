00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.299
Welcome to Sequencer Features.

2
00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.580
The Sequencer UI is straightforward and seems very familiar.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.220
Its design is reminiscent of Adobe After Effects and Premiere, but instead of editing

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.859
rendered movie footage, Sequencer edits footage containing animated 3D assets.

5
00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.780
The toolbar houses all of the primary settings, menus, render options, and breadcrumb indicators

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.140
to help the user navigate between level sequences.

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.280
The Outliner on the left adds actors and organizes tracks.

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.659
You can drag actors into this area from the Outliner or use the green plus add button.

9
00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.039
The timeline manages the playhead, defines track content, and gives a visual display

10
00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.380
of what's happening from audio waveforms to setting keyframe indicators.

11
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.260
The selection details pane displays properties and binding information, and the playback

12
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:58.420
area allows sequence, transport controls, and time range sliders for defining your work area.

13
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.299
Working in combination with Sequencer's Outliner, the event manager and its triggers can be added

14
00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.479
to a sequence and tied to specific blueprint endpoints.

15
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.459
This function allows precisely to control when specific events occur within a level sequence.

16
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.539
These triggers could initiate particle systems or tell Unreal when to jump out of Sequencer

17
00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.099
and into gameplay.

18
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:24.979
The Sequencer Curve Editor is a helpful feature for traditional 3D animators.

19
00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.799
Specific tracks can be identified, isolated, hidden, or shown within the controls on the left.

20
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.819
Keyframes can be moved, scaled, tweened, and tangents can be weighted or broken as needed

21
00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.379
by the artist to control animated motion.

22
00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:46.659
The Sequencer Template is a feature that is intended for ease of use and quick shot creation.

23
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.979
If you know how many shots you'll need and approximately the average length of each shot,

24
00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.179
this template can construct a parent level sequence with as many nested level sequence

25
00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.259
shots as you require.

26
00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.799
This makes the organization of shots easy, and it can create identical shot parameters

27
00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.060
for each nested level sequence.

28
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.639
In this demonstration, we'll take a look at how event management is handled in Sequencer

29
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.539
with a simple example.

30
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.099
By adding an event track into Sequencer, the user can create dedicated triggers that execute

31
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.019
specific functions in what is known as the Director Blueprint.

32
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.699
The Director Blueprint is a special type of blueprint that's tied to your specific level

33
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.019
sequence.

34
00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.579
When bound to an actor like a particle system, Sequencer can execute the trigger at a specific

35
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.859
point in time to activate the particle system.

36
00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.740
So I have a particle system here.

37
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.500
It's an explosion that I got from the starter content.

38
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.780
If I click on the Admitter and go over to the Details panel, I'll search for Auto-Activate

39
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.139
and I want to turn this off.

40
00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.779
I don't want the explosion just going off by itself.

41
00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.299
Next I'll need to take the explosion and the Admitter and add it into Sequencer.

42
00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.459
Actor to Sequencer, Add P Explosion.

43
00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.139
Now I'll click on the plus track button and I want to add an event trigger.

44
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:08.019
This event track will allow me to set keyframes anywhere I want, so I'll just create one here.

45
00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.099
Now this keyframe doesn't do anything yet, and the reason for that is it's not bound

46
00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.579
to the specific Director Blueprint yet.

47
00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.939
To do that you can do it in one of two ways.

48
00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:23.539
You can either right click over the keyframe itself, go to Properties and click on Unbound,

49
00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.500
or you can double click on the keyframe itself.

50
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.579
This will open up the Director Blueprint and you can see our specific P Explosion event.

51
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:42.420
I'm going to create a toggle active node and make sure that everything is tied together.

52
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.500
I'll compile and I'll go back to our example.

53
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.140
Now we still won't have an explosion yet, there's one more thing that we have to do.

54
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.180
Right click over the keyframe, go to Properties and say Call in Editor.

55
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.740
And once you do that, anytime that you drag the time marker over the keyframe the explosion

56
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.020
will happen.

57
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.620
So there you go.

58
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.460
Anytime that you drag this over there you'll get another explosion, and you can set as

59
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.700
many of these keyframes throughout the event track as you wish.

60
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.740
Next up is the Curve Editor, which is launched within the Sequencers UI and is capable of

61
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.139
refining animation curves, keyframe placements, and tangent settings to achieve the desired

62
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.460
results.

63
00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:30.659
With its unique set of keyframe scaling tools, animators have very precise control over anything

64
00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.099
animated within Sequencer.

65
00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.000
So I have Manny here and he has a control rig, and I've placed some animation on his

66
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.299
arm to do a little wave.

67
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.620
And if I want to look at those curves, it's just simply select the IK handle and go into

68
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.179
the Curve Editor.

69
00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.139
Now we can see all of the individual keys and the individual curves.

70
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.099
You can view these curves with different viewing modes.

71
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.260
You can use the Transform tool to select curves and scale them from different pivot

72
00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.379
points.

73
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.780
So right now this is all scaling from the center.

74
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.700
If I put the pivot point down into the corner, I can scale this by that.

75
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.300
There is also the Retime Lattice tool, which is a way to basically retime curves based

76
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.820
off of a two dimensional lattice.

77
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:25.300
So by double clicking here, I can add lattice points inside the Curve Editor in order to

78
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.899
scale and modify keyframes.

79
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:35.339
There's also the Multi-Select tool, which is another mechanism to scale individual curves

80
00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.060
or multiple sets of curves, which is also pretty nice.

81
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.100
You can scale horizontally, vertically, etc.

82
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.100
Finally, there's a number of different tangent tools across here.

83
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.860
Using these, you can go and put them onto AutoCubic or you can break tangents, you can

84
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.100
weight tangents, make them constant or linear.

85
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.260
There's a number of different functions here within the Curve Editor that are pretty effective.

86
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.740
Alright, let's move on to our last feature.

87
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.860
The last feature I want to demonstrate in this module is the Sequencer Template.

88
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.700
Select the function in the Create Level Sequence button and it will allow you to set the number

89
00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.659
of shots, their duration, and other specifics like directory placement and numbering settings.

90
00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.620
Once it's executed, you can find the parent level sequence and the shots you specified

91
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.819
in the folder of your choice.

92
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.939
So here's the Create Level Sequence button and we'll go up here to Add Level Sequences

93
00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:31.939
with Shots.

94
00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:36.860
I can give it a specific name, I'll call it Test, and it'll be saved in the root path

95
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.139
of Game Cinematic Sequences.

96
00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.060
I'm going to ask for five shots and each shot will be five seconds in length.

97
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.379
So when I say Create Level Sequence with Shots, it will create the level sequence and you

98
00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:57.899
can see that I have one, two, three, four, five shots and that's located here in Cinematics

99
00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.259
Sequences Test.

100
00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.819
Alright, this concludes our brief overview of some of Sequencer's features.

101
00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.899
Let's move on to our next module that covers some powerful tools.
