00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello everyone, and welcome to today's Quick Start class on Sequencer Shot Creation.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.560
My name is Brian Poole, and I'll be your authorized Unreal instructor throughout this course.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.919
Here's a quick look at what we'll be covering today.

4
00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.960
In exploring Sequencer fundamentals, we'll examine some core concepts of Sequencer's

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.400
capabilities like what is Sequencer, what's a level sequence, and we'll discuss actor

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.320
persistence types.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.280
That will be followed by an examination of core structures in Sequencer, we'll define

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.759
a few terms, and we'll compare Unreal Sequencer to the structure of film production.

9
00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:41.679
In Sequencer features and tools, we'll take a look at Sequencer's interface, discuss

10
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.799
event management, curve editing, and set up a level sequence template.

11
00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.719
Plus, we'll spend some time learning about Unreal cameras, their components, and primary

12
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.719
feature sets.

13
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.560
In hands-on shot creation and assembly, this section will focus on how to actually set

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.159
up a level sequence assembly and how it ties into the camera cuts track, followed by a

15
00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.439
practical exercise.

16
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.200
And in final recommendations, we'll talk about level organization, folder structures,

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.079
and Sequencer best practices.

18
00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.000
And then we'll look into some potential tips and resources.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.079
Alright, let's get started.

20
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.759
Today's class will be utilizing the SEQ-10501 map level.

21
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.480
In the SEQ-90501-55 project file, it can be downloaded under content, courses, course

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.980
maps.

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.880
The project file you've downloaded contains items associated with four different courses.

24
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.400
We'll be examining the course SEQ-10501.

25
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.760
Our goal for this course is to start familiarizing ourselves with Sequencer and understanding

26
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.719
the basics of creating multiple shots within a single level sequence.

27
00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.319
This project will utilize a level, contain a character, two cameras, and a camera cuts

28
00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.640
track.

29
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.959
This first approach is the more simplistic of two Sequencer assembly methods, where

30
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.519
the second method leverages multiple nested level sequences.

31
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:07.079
We'll get into more in-depth on nested level sequences during another course.

32
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.560
However, I'll promise you a sneak peek into what a nested level sequence setup looks like

33
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.919
just so you can understand the difference.

34
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:21.519
Once you've downloaded the zip file and extracted its contents, you should see the SEQ-90501-55

35
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.759
project file.

36
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.079
This file was created in Unreal 5.5, so if you have an earlier version of the engine,

37
00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.079
you should upgrade.

38
00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.839
If you have a later version of Unreal, you'll have to convert the project file to Unreal

39
00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:39.000
5.6 by following the prompts Unreal provides for you upon launching this project.

40
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.119
Now the primary map should load automatically, but in case it doesn't, let's take a look

41
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.599
as to where you can find it.

42
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.039
Inside the contents folder, there is the courses folder.

43
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.240
This folder contains the course maps folder.

44
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.599
Within here, you'll find maps for all four courses within this project.

45
00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.840
In case your level didn't open upon launch, let's double click on the SEQ-10501 map.

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.040
This will bring you into rural Australia.

47
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.680
Now if you take a look around, this is really a great map, and it has some very realistic

48
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.680
models and textures.

49
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.200
What's even better is that it's highly optimized to run on most computers and GPUs with ease.

50
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.200
This map can be found in FAB in case you're interested in having it within your own library.

51
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.200
Now if you're curious as to where the assets are for this level, they're located within

52
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.159
the assets folder.

53
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.319
There is a rural Australia folder, and it contains all of the individual component parts.

54
00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:44.079
If we look over here in the outliner, everything is nicely organized into folders and named

55
00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.479
beautifully with a dedicated naming convention.

56
00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.039
Now the level sequence we'll be examining and ultimately recreating is located in the

57
00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.159
course folder.

58
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.159
You'll navigate to the SEQ-105 folder, and then open course topics, and finally the

59
00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.240
camera cuts folder.

60
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.840
The level sequence is seq-cinicam-ex.

61
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.000
Now if you'd like to take a look, double click on the level sequence icon.

62
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.879
This will open the sequencer UI and allow you to view the sequence by clicking on the

63
00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.079
camera icon in the camera cuts track, and then by pressing play.

64
00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:28.079
So click on this button, and press play.

65
00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:41.960
Now this will show you two cameras being tied together through a camera blend in the camera

66
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.079
cuts track, but more on this later.

67
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:49.519
In our next module, we'll take a look at some core concepts behind sequencer and understand

68
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:54.519
the theory of how sequencer fundamentals operate.
