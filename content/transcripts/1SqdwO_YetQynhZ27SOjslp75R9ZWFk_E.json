  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on jump animations. In this video, we are going to be using the state machine to create a jump animation loop. And that's going to consist of three animations. So it's going to consist of start jump, a falling loop and a landing animation. So let's go back into the project now. So the first thing we're going to want to do is open back up our animation blueprint. Now, in order to trigger this animation, we need to know if the character is in the air. So this would cover either if it was falling or jumping. And we're going to do that on the event blueprint update animation. Now, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add in a sequence at the beginning. And I can do that by holding down the S key and left clicking on the background. I'm just going to connect that up here. This is just so I can keep things tidy, really. And here on the then one output pin, I'm going to do is I'm going to grab another reference to the character movement. So I'll just copy this and paste this here. Because we're going to use the character movement component again, because that's going to tell us if we are in the air. There's a function which allows us to figure this out. You drag off and you type in is falling. And you'll see that this function will detect if you are falling and it's going to return a Boolean value for true if you're falling and false if you're not falling. So I will right hand click on this and promote this to a variable. I'm going to call this variable is falling. And connect that up. All this is going to do each time the animation is updated, he's just going to check the character movement, see if we're falling and save that to a variable. As I mentioned before, this is going to run multiple animations. We're going to use the state machine to achieve this. So I'm going to jump back into our locomotion state machine. As you can see at the moment, we only have idle to run. Now I want to add three more states. Now I'm going to do that by just coming over to my assets, coming over to my asset library here, and I'm going to search for jump. And I'll find M M underscore jump, drag that in. You can see it's going to automatically create a state that is going to play the M M underscore jump animation. It's a nice quick way to make a state. I could rename it, but I'm not going to worry about that now. The next one I want, if I type in fall, is the M M underscore fall loop. Drag that in, place that over here. And the final one I want is land. And I'm going to drag that in down the bottom here. Now, in order for us to use any of these, we are going to have to connect them up. So if I come from the idle to run, drag over and connect that up, it's going to create me a transition between these two states. Do that, and I am going to create another transition from the jump to the fall loop, the last one from the fall loop to the land loop, and the final one back to the idle to run. Now this is the first time we've come across transitions. The transition is going to be a gate, which when the condition is true, it will move you into the other state or animation with a little bit of a blend in between. So at the moment, if I was to click on the idle to run animation, you can see here I have a Boolean input with a can enter transition. Now we have nothing plugged into this. We want to plug in some kind of condition to see if we can enter this transition. And what we're going to do for that is we're just going to grab the isFalling variable we populated and place that on top. So if I jump back. So what this is going to mean is we're going to start in the idle to run, and as soon as it's detected that we're falling, it's going to move down this transition to the m m underscore jump. M underscore jump and play that animation. Now we'll also want to move out of this transition into the m underscore m full loop. So if I double click on this transition. And to enter this transition, I want to wait until the animation that we've just played is almost finished. So how I'm going to do that is I'm going to right hand click and I am going to search for remain. And you'll see that we have an option of time remaining and time remaining ratio. I'm going to use the time remaining ratio. And I'm going to drag out. And I'm going to do is less than and have point one. Less than point one. So right at the end of the animation. Now I'm going to connect that up. This means when the animation is almost over, you can enter the transition into the next section. Now we're in the full loop. I want to leave the full loop when we're no longer full. So it's going to remain in here until we hit the ground. And so I'm going to jump into this transition here. From here again, I'm going to grab the is fully. However, this time I'm just going to get it because I want to do this one on the floor. So I want to pay. I want to add a Boolean for not not Boolean. And I want to plug that in. So what this is going to do is it's going to check that we are no longer falling. Then it will allow us to enter the next state. Finally, for our last transition, I'm going to jump in. We are just going to kick this arm. This means we will automatically be able to enter the other transition. So we're going to do this because this animation is so short. So this is going to show us that just the blend in and the blend out time is going to be enough for us. Hit compile. And now if I come back into the game and I play, you're going to see that we hit something a little bit odd. I jump. Suddenly at a small point, I shrink down to almost nothing. This is an oddity of the land animation. So let's go back to the state tree. If I go into the MM underscore land. Now, the odd thing about the land animation is this is an additive animation. So it is actually very small because it only contains the data that would need to be added to another animation in order to imitate the rebound on the floor. So therefore, if we play this as a simple animation, it's going to shrink the character down to that small additive data. Now, in order to fix this, what I'm going to do is I am going to disconnect the result pin here. And I'm going to search for a apply. Additive. I'm going to plug this into our output pin. I'm going to plug the MM underscore land into the additive. Now I need a base animation at this point to play. So we're going to use the blend space that we created. So I'm going to find the my blend space walk run, drag that in and then plug that into the base. And again, in order to get this to work, we need to add the speed in. And so what this is going to do is it's going to go back to our walk cycle and play that because we've hit the ground. And it's just going to add in the small rebound additive data in here so we can see that rebound. If we now compile, save, jump back into the map and play, you should see this is a pretty realistic run and jump. In the next video, we're going to look at how we can trigger an animation to be played from a keyboard input. Thank you.",
