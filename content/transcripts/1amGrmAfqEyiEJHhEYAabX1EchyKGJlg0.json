  "text": " Alright, in this section we're going to take a look at Sequencer's features and tools, and we'll begin with the Sequencer features. Naturally, the first feature that we're going to look at is the most important, and that's the Sequencer user interface. I've broken this down into four primary sections that you can look at and reference within this image. Feel free to pause or take a screenshot for reference later, but let's jump into the engine to really explore the Sequencer user interface. Now in order to view the Sequencer user interface, we're going to need an active level sequence. To activate one, we're going to locate that by going into the SEQ10501 folder, move through the course topics, and choose the Sequencer short example folder. From there you'll find an SEQ film level sequence. Simply double-click on that to activate and launch the Sequencer user interface. Now the first stop is the toolbar. This is marked as Section 1 within our slides. From the toolbar you can do things such as add a CineCamera Actor and Camera Cuts track, adjust our frame rate, set automatic keyframes, adjust snapping options, activate our render options, save our level sequence, and activate our Sequencer curves editor. From the toolbar over to the right side of that toolbar, we can use the breadcrumb section to quickly navigate between nested level sequences. Now the best way to do that is to simply double-click onto whatever shot you want to navigate into and then make changes. Once you're done working and your changes are complete, you simply move back up to the breadcrumb section and navigate back to the sequence container that you were working in from the start. Over to what we have marked as Section 2 in the slides is the Sequencer Outliner. This is where we can add or filter any tracks that we can use inside the Event Manager which works to manage any of our shots, animations, characters, blueprints, fade tracks, groups, subscenes, and material parameter collections. Over to the right of our Event Manager is our Timeline. And I've separated this out from the Event Manager as Section 3 because there's quite a bit that can be done here. This is where our playhead lives. The playhead is located at the top and allows you to scrub through your timeline and its placement will impact where your edits and connections are made within the level sequences, active options, and assets. The timeline also provides you access to the Tracks area where you can actually see what's being worked on and what is active. This is where any event triggers, animation tracks, control rigs, camera translations, or rotation movements, or any exposed parameters will be keyframed or animated. That leaves us with the final area which is marked as Section 4 in our slides and that is our Playback Controls. This is also where our time slider is located. And this is where our time range slider can be adjusted. It's also where we can do things like play, move between frames or step and loop playback as needed. We can also record from here using the take recorder that is integrated into Sequencer. Now I just want to emphasize that Sequencer is an Event Manager and it can be used to trigger events in game or manage any kind of action exposed to Sequencer inside the level sequence that you are working on. Additionally, while I open the Sequencer Curves Editor, I want to reiterate that this feature allows you to adjust keyframes and curves as you are going through and animating or moving things around inside the engine. And that Sequencer works with Take Recorder, Cinematic Assets, Blueprints, Niagara, Control Rig, Composure and Material parameters. Finally, Sequencer also has some project templates that you can work from and in some of our courses there may be various options that you will be using in our training or to start with your own projects. That can be any of the film and video live event templates, games templates or any of the other options in the project browser that I recommend you go through and play with in order to see which one of the templates might fit your needs. Once you've started your project, there is also a template for Sequencer called the Level Sequence with Shots. This is a good template to start with and can be accessed from the main engine toolbar. It will allow you to create several shots and it's quite helpful if you already know how many shots you need before you start your shot creation. Just be aware that this is a uniform shot creation template so any settings established from this template will carry over to each shot that is made. That means you most likely have to go back and alter each of these shots once they are created. It's also a reason why I prefer to create Level Sequences in a slightly different manner. So if I jump really quickly back into the engine and I dock my Level Sequence tools, let's move Sequencer down into here and my Sequence Curves, I want to show this template and show the best way to actually make a Level Sequence. Now the template can be activated here with the Level Sequence Shots and that brings up this template shot section and allows you several options. It also allows you to add in a Level Sequence for duplication, but I find there's an easier way to make Level Sequences. Go into your Content Browser, right click into it, move up to the Cinematic section and move in to create a Level Sequence. That generates the Level Sequence that you want to work from. You can just name that in there and then anytime you need to make additional shots or any other scenes such as what you have in here, all you need to do is click on what you want to work through and hit Ctrl D to duplicate it. Rename it to whatever it is that you want to work from and that is the best way to create your Level Sequences. That's it for this section of Sequencers features. In our next section we're going to explore a few of Sequencers tools.",
