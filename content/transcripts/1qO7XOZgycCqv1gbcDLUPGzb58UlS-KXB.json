  "text": " Now what we're going to do is disable a few existing modules in our stack as they're not really working in our favor. We are then going to also adjust how the alpha of this works and add the ability for our smoke to fade in and fade out, because we want our smoke to look something like this, where we have a fade at the top and a fade at the bottom, and if we just go ahead and have a fade down at the zero and that there's no fade at the top, the smoke is just going to disappear. This is going to look really weird when we go to view this, because it's not going to simulate reality, it's not going to reflect how we would expect this to work. Let's pop over to the editor. Now the first thing first, we're going to come over here to our particle update, and we're going to disable drag and gravity force. This is going to make our particle look like it's lifting up right now. But notice that the particles, they're heavy in there and they're just popping in, and it looks like they're fading out, but they're not really giving us the best results. Let's come over to our scale color, and we can see exactly what's going on here. This scale alpha, so we have it start at zero and then go to one. They're going to fade out nicely, but what we want to do is we want it to start almost at nothing, fade in and then fade out. I'm going to come here and I'm just going to middle mouse button right in the middle of this, and that's going to add a new key to this graph right here. Then what I can do is I can select these and do something like this. Zero and zero. It's going to fade in, and then here we're going to say 0.5, but instead of 0.55 for the value, we're going to say 1 because we do want that smoke to actually come to full opacity, and then we're going to fade out. We can also adjust our tangents as well, and if we click on these, we can set them to auto, and this will allow us to have this really great-looking smoke that fades in as it's created and then fades out as it is destroyed.",
