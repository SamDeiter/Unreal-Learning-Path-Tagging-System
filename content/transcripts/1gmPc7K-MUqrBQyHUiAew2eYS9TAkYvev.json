  "text": " Welcome back. So this next section is going to be all about animation blend control. And I am already in the Unreal Engine. And hopefully you already know about the Epic launcher. What I did to create this vanilla project is go to File, New Project right here. I used a games template. I hit Next. I'm using the third person template. I hit Next. It does not matter if you have starter content or not. You could just keep all of this default. The main thing is that you come up with a logical name for your project and hit the friendly green Create Project button. And then you should be good to go. So as you're doing that, I'm going to do some housekeeping. I'm just going to control middle mouse to make these icons a bit bigger in case you're on a laptop. And then I'm also going to show the sources panel. That was right underneath the green Add Import button right there. Okay. So we are going to navigate our way to the mannequin folder. I'll just double click on there and then go into the animations folder. And what you want to do is double click the third person and a BP asset. So it's got an orange line on the bottom. Double click on him and then I'm just going to dock the tab up at the top. And by default, you should probably be looking at the jump loop to jump end rule, which is just where it opens automatically. That's not super useful for what we want to do. So instead, I would have you navigate up a couple levels and I want you to double click on the Anim Graph. This is where we will be spending most of our time. Now if for some reason you don't see what I'm seeing, maybe the Anim Graph is gone. I just closed that tab. What you can do is you can also find it underneath the My Blueprint tab. Double click on the Anim Graph right there and then you're good to go again. If for some reason you don't have the My Blueprint tab. Okay, I just exit out. Oh no, it's gone. If you go to Window, My Blueprint, you're good as gold. Okay, so you're good. Alright, so I'm going to Control, middle mouse and now I can zoom in a little bit more. Make this a little bit more optimized. We'll try that and see if that works. Really the main two places you will probably spend the most of your time when you're in an animation blueprint is first and foremost the animation graph, Anim Graph. Second would be the Event Graph and if you've done blueprints, this should be very familiar with the nodes and the blueprint coding and things like that. So I'm going to go back to the Anim Graph and this section is used to evaluate the final pose of your skeletal mesh every single frame because this is a game engine so when you hit play this gets executed every single frame. Currently there's a state machine plugged into the output pose and we'll talk more about that later but it is driving the animation when you hit play and alternatively, you know, we could plug in animation clips which you can easily access in the asset browser over here on the right. We could plug in live linked streaming motion capture data. We could combine several different things. Really the combinations are endless. Now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to Alt, left mouse button click on this execution wire. It looks like a human person. I'll just Alt, left mouse button click and then that disconnects the wire and next thing, let's figure out how do we add more nodes to this animation graph. So if you find an empty space somewhere in this grid, right click, then you can type in blend for instance and there's a lot of blend nodes. We'll get through a decent number of these and the first one we're going to talk about is apply additive. Go ahead and click on that. Now I want you to think of the apply additive node as a way to accessorize your animations. It's usually adding motion to a subsection of the skeleton like an arm punch or a kick or a head nod when the character interacts with an object or another character. With the traditional animation pipeline you would have needed to save out all the animation combinations as separate assets. So you would need the walking kick and the running kick and the idle kick and the walking punch and the running punch etc. What's great about animation blueprints is that all of this behavior is happening dynamically and so no matter what my base animation is I just have to apply one additive animation on top of it and they get added together so to speak. So what we could do is plug our state machine and say we want that to be our base animation and then let's add something on top. Before we do that let's finish the execution wire stream and also click drag the output stream of the apply additive node and plug that into the result of the output post. So now everything is all connected and then you'll notice that our preview is out of date. We need to compile so you can either click the green button right here or the compile button in the top. So either one of those. It still looks the same. Let's go ahead and save and hit play just so you get familiar with the behavior. So the state machine is controlling my transitions between running and walking and idling and jumping and things like that. So this is square one. I'll hit escape to get out of our gameplay mode and then I'll go back to the animation blueprint tab. Now we have to do a little bit of prep work to get an animation that is practical and makes sense for additive animation. So if we look at the animations that we have to choose from most of the bones have movement on there and we really just want to isolate a couple bones. I mean you could do additive animation of just the torso up or just one leg or just one arm but these animations are too complex for what we need. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the skeleton which can be found from the sub editor breadcrumbs in the top right. So just click the skeleton square and then from there let's use this default a pose make an animation out of it and then add a head animation. So it's very clear what's going on. It will just be the head. This will make more sense. And what you can do is create an asset and then create animation and you could either do current pose or the reference pose because currently they are the exact same thing. And if I were to move the arm up or something then the current pose would be different than this reference pose which is also known as the a pose for this particular character. So I'll just do current pose and then we will be asked where we want to save this. So I like to put things under the mannequin animations folder and this is going to be the base for our head shake additive animation. So I'm going to call this head shake. I'll hit OK and it's only one frame long. That's why the flicker of the timeline is a little bit annoying. So the next thing is OK we need it to be more than one frame long. And I'm going to right click in this medium 50% gray part of the toolbar and I want to append at the end. I want to add some more frames. And if we were working on a 30 frames per second workflow it would make sense to add you know 29 more frames. We'll hit enter. OK so now the timeline is not spazzing out. Good. All right so let me pause the timeline. Now we do have an intro to animation course that goes into this interface in way more detail but don't worry if you haven't seen it. And the next thing is we would want to add the head animation. So if I click on the head I have feedback that's telling me I have the right joint. Good. OK then what I like to do for any animation is I like to have these bookend keyframes at the beginning and the end so that it will loop nicely no matter what I do in the middle. So I want to make sure that I go to the beginning of my timeline. So I will hit this to front button at the bottom. OK so now my timeline is at the very beginning and I can hit this key button to set a keyframe. So we'll save that position of the head then we'll go to the very end and then key again. So now in between there I want the head to move back and forth. Maybe let me get an exact number maybe on frame 8 the head will rotate and move to the left and then let's keyframe it. Make sure you move the timeline to the right frame and then you do the movement and then you key it. And for this next one I want the frame to be at 20 and let's rotate the head to the right and then key that. So you should see a little zigzag squiggle in your curve preview. And if for some reason you don't have the ability to rotate you can also just use this toolbar up here if you don't remember those hotkeys yet. So let's preview this so I'm going to hit play. OK I'm OK with this. But if you were not happy with the result you can click on the curve little pull down right here next to head and then go to edit curve and then you could change the value. For instance you know maybe I wanted that value to be a nice round number I could change it to 40 and then I could highlight the other keyframe and make it negative 40. So it rounds out the numbers a bit better. OK. So make sure we hit save so we have those changes. I just use the space bar to toggle playback. All right. I'm happy with this. So if we go back to the third person animation blueprint what I can do is I can grab the newly created head shake animation and I could either drag it in and then you know move it over and then connect the wires and apply it to the additive slot or it's a little bit faster to do it this second way. If I delete the play head shake node I can drag that animation directly onto the additive slot and I wait for that little green checkbox to show up and then it hooks it up for you which is nice. Now we need to compile and it's perfect. No there's one more thing we have to do so that the data gets processed correctly because this is the hot mess. OK so if we go back to the head shake animation it's just one setting over on the left under asset details is the additive animation type and currently it says no additive so that's why it's confused. So if you change that to local space and hit save it's going to look a lot better. So see how much I had to zoom out. If I zoom back in we see a person and they're shaking their head it's listening to the state machine and it's adding the head shake on top of it. So I'm going to compile save go to my third person example map tab hit play and then look he is shaking his head while he's jumping and he's shaking his head while he's running and there's our additive animation. OK so I hit escape. One more thing to talk about if I go back to the third person and BP let's talk about the alpha value. So currently the alpha is set to one. So the base motion is always going to be on the alpha value it just controls the strength of the additive animation. So just to see that worked out let's change this value to zero and then I compile. OK my head shake it went away. If I change the alpha to point five and I compile then that affected the strength of the additive animation. So the head shake is about half as vigorous as it was. So if I pull it back to full strength. OK that distance is back to the original full amount. OK so that is what we have for this video. If a rendered animation is your final deliverable you probably won't use this node as much because there's features like sequencer and control rig. There are amazing features but if you're a gamer this is more useful.",
