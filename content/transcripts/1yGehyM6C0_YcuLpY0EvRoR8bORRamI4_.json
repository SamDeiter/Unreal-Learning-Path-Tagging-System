  "text": " Hello and welcome to this short video on setup for the Python integration program. In this, we're just going to make sure that we've got the project running and that everything is installed accordingly. So once you've downloaded the files and unzipped it, you're going to see that you have three different directories in here. For the first one, 21.5.0.0.py, this one is the actual project files. The other two, one of them is going to be a lot of the Python code which comes with the project and one of the libraries we will be using, PyCache. The other one is going to be some FBXs that we're going to use to demonstrate importing assets into the engine. Now once you've opened up the project, come in, and it will just click on 21. This project is written in Unreal Engine 5.5, but it will probably work in future versions. You might have to right-hand click and switch the Unreal Engine version. Once you've opened up the project, you should hopefully get something that looks a little bit like this. Now the only thing that might be different is you can see that we have this little window here called Teaching Aid. Now this might be a free-floating window. What I've done is I've dragged it up to the corner here and docked it and moved it up just so that I can see this top section here. This is just a small tool that allows us to move within the project and swap over the content, the content drawer, just so that we can make sure that we're all looking at exactly the same things when we're doing these small exercises. The other thing I'd like to mention while I'm in this is how you make sure your project is running and using Python correctly. Now in order to do that, what I would do is I'd come up to Edit under Plugins. If you search for Python, you're going to see that there are a number of different Python libraries here. Now we have in this version Python Editor Scripting plugin turned on, and it should be turned on if you're using the project. We also have the Sequencer Scripting turned on here, but there are a number of other ones. We have the Python Foundation packages. This is a Python which will just include a couple of the libraries NumPy, PyTorch, so that you can access them in the path easily. Also, Python automation testing, I haven't really had a chance to play with that too much. The other one is Geometry Scripting here, which we're not going to use, but you may want to turn on because what this is going to allow you to do is query and edit meshes from within Python. Now, this is displaying just the Python plugins that we have available. However, these aren't necessarily going to give you all the code. Now, since the Python Unreal library is generated from the back of the code, if you turn on and off more plugins, anything that would be marked as Blueprint editable and is something to be used within the editor scripting, you're usually going to be able to access via Python. So don't limit yourself to these plugins just because they have Python written on them, or the plugins may help you out in this in this. OK, so that is the Python ones. If you don't have these switched on, you might want to switch them on at this point. Now, that's going to be all I think we need to look at before we start using Python itself. Thank you very much. That's the end of this video on setup. Next up, we're going to start looking at the different integration methods for Python.",
