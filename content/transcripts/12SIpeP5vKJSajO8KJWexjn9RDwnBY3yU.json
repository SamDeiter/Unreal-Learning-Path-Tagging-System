  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at a material overview. Now, you should cover these in your previous classes, but this is going to be an overview of what to consider and what to think about. In the lesson that I give you, substrate is active and the best thing I can tell you is, don't use substrate for your projects just yet. It is one from one of our demos in which we show off substrate, but substrate still in beta and also if you convert a scene to substrate, you can't go back to regular materials. It's an all or nothing scenario. Just keep that in mind and make sure that you're using the default materials to start out and once substrate is released, you can go in that direction. We're going to focus on the default material system to start out here, and then feel free to explore substrate on your own. But again, I wanted to make this statement, don't use it for production just yet because it's still evolving and it's not quite there yet. You want to create a simple material whenever you start, and you do want to connect the nodes as needed. This is a really bare bones material example, and in your material classes, we go into things a bit deeper. But what I want to mention is when you do create your materials, you want to set things up so that things are ready to go for instance materials. Let me show you how that works. Whenever you have a node set up in Unreal, in this case, it's a texture sample node, or even say a three constant vector, keep my finger on the three key and left-click. You want to be able to expose these parameters. If I make an instance of this parent material, I can access these and swap things out on the fly. I would literally just right-click and say, hey, convert to parameter, and then I would give it a name, we'll just call this texture. It doesn't have anything in them right now, but you get the idea. The same thing with any nodes at old color or other texture information. You want to convert to a parameter. When you do, we'll just say color, you'll be able to actually access these if you make an instance of it. This is a very good practice to do. The same thing if you had, say just you had a simple constant. I'm going to keep my finger on the one key and left-click, and I can convert this to a parameter. Now I have a range. We'll call this amount of color. You can lock this down to a minimum, a maximum, and a default. Don't forget to make sure you group things as you go. You can see some grouping that I already have here. That's going to show up in your instance material when you make it. Case in point, here's an instance material of a material that I made. In here, you'll see that we have tiling, albedo, metallic, specular all because they're grouped, and also because those parameters are open, to be able to be accessed and swapped out. If we scroll down further, you'll see that the texture, the normal, and the DR here in this particular case, we can actually go in here and actually swap those textures out as we need. Even our albedo for oxidization. I can't seem to say that today. Well, when the air hits the material, you can put it that way. But all these things are primed to be able to be swapped out and controlled. You want to get into this habit because when you work with materials, having an instance material makes it so that it is no longer needed to constantly be recompiled. You'll actually have updates on the fly. Now, don't get me wrong, if you have a lot of instance materials coming from one primary material, it can become a GPU hog. It's best to actually categorize your instance materials when you work. What that means is, I can have instance materials for all my rock materials, and inorganic wood and rock, if that all fits within there. I can have instance materials for a parent material, which is focused on translucency. All my instance materials and variance of the translucency will come from that parent translucent material. The same thing goes, such as you say you had some organic, it means we'll do an alien scenario like alien flesh or clothing. You would all go that same route where you have a parent material and it has its dependencies and specifics in its shading model and so forth. Then you can bleed from that into those other instance materials. That makes the best approach so that you are organizing things according to needs. Then if you change them, you know exactly how those changes are going to affect things that are in that category. Again here, you can see in the notes why, talk about saving memory and draw calls. You don't have the same all sorts of different parent materials in here. You're keeping things a bit light on the overhead. Again, this will allow us to swap out the textures, the looks, and the feels quickly. We can even change say albedo desaturation. I can do that on the fly and it will change in the editor without any recompiling of that shader. That's it with this course topic. Feel free to click on the link that we've provided, if you want to dive in a bit deeper. In the next group of videos, we're going to be talking about Foldage Tool Quick Take.",
