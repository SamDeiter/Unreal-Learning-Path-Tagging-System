  "text": " Now that we have all of our content set up, we have tested things and everything seems to be working the way that we want. We're now going to take a look at how we set up our level from absolutely nothing. And what I mean by that is what we need to do in order to basically create a brand new empty open world. And then we're going to set this up with everything that is required. So we're going to import a height map and then add our lights and our atmospheric actors and things like that. So to get started, what we're going to do is we're going to come over here to the editor. We're going to do a file new level and we're going to select empty open world. Now before we jump a little bit further, there are a few things that I want to explain about the empty open world map and why it's so important. And the first thing is the grid. The grid is the term that we use to describe our streaming grid. And this grid controls where assets are seen and more importantly, where they're not seen. So when we create our world using the open world template, we're already going to have our world set up to make use of this grid. And the grid works by loading in the different cells. You can see the cells marked here. When this loading range approaches them or gets further away from them and this loading range is actually connected to our character. So we have a streaming source and in many instances, it is going to be the character and the streaming source defines the more or less the center of your world. And then as your player progresses throughout the world, the streaming source is going to allow things to be streamed in and streamed out. So that's one of the reasons why we want to come up here and make sure that we've gone up to file new level and created this empty open world map because then we'll have our world partition enabled and ready to go. Now the next thing that we need to do here is we need to add some actors. So what we're going to do is we're going to add a directional light, a skylight, sky atmosphere, volumetric cloud and an exponential height fox. So let's go ahead and add all of these now. So we're going to come up here. We're going to go quickly add. We're going to look for DIR. We're going to grab this directional light. And one thing we want to do with the directional light too is we want to come here and just set this to movable. And let's do this now for our sky. We're going to grab our skylight and the same thing. We're going to take our skylight and we're going to set it to movable. And then we're going to come here and we're going to add a sky atmosphere. And then we're going to add a volumetric cloud. And last but not least, we're going to add an exponential height fog. So I'm going to leave this menu up here for just a few moments to let you go ahead and add all of these actors. And once we come back, what we're going to do is we're going to work on importing our height map. All right. Now that we have all of those actors placed inside of our level, we're now going to look at importing a height map. Now when you're working with height maps, there are a few different file formats that you can work with. There's going to be the raw 16, raw 8, and PNG. Now R16 is going to be the best format. It works with height map data. The R8 is for weight map data and PNG will work, but it is going to introduce some stair stepping artifacts. Now for our purposes, what we're going to do is we're going to come up here and go to landscape. And we're going to instead of create a new, we're going to go import from file. And what we're going to do here is the height map file. I'm going to press this button right here. And this is going to ask us where we want to go. And we're going to come up in here to our files and to our height maps. And we're going to select this, not impact, I'm sorry, the grassy hills base and hit open. Now once we do that, we are going to get a preview of this landscape. And you're going to notice that there are these yellow and green areas. So the yellow is actually the world partition grid size. So here we can set this so that we are streaming and basically every landscape component will be in, I shouldn't say every landscape component, but we will be streaming in four landscape components per grid. So we can set this up here. Other things that we can do here is we can adjust our resolution. If we have a varying resolution, we can set our material here. And then we have the ability to change things like our location and our scale. So for us, though, the only thing I'm going to change here is I'm going to set this to zero. And then I'm going to click the import. And this is going to take a moment to import. There we go. And while that finishes up, let's just pop back over here to our presentation, because the next thing that we're going to do on our landscape, and then we're going to save this is enable Nanite. So again, the reason we want to enable Nanite on our landscape at this point is so that when we put the displacement on there, we are going to get that displacement and it's going to look really cool. So let's pop back over here to our editor. So this is our landscape right here. I'm just going to disable my fog for right now so we kind of see what's going on. So this is what everything is going to look like. And then what I'm going to do now is I'm going to pop out of our selection mode here and I'm going to come to my landscape itself and go ahead, enable Nanite. And then I'm going to build my Nanite data. And once this builds, let's go ahead and save this as my level or give it a name. And then once that is done, we're going to go ahead and move on to editing our level. All right. Now that our Nanite has finished saving or I should say finished generating, let's go ahead and just save this. And we're going to save this as my level. And once that saves, we will be ready to start editing our level and working with various features and tools inside of the editor.",
