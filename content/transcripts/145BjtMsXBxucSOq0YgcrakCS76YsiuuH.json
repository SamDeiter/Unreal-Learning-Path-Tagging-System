  "text": " Moving on to material optimizations, there are some really great optimizations you can put into your materials. Some nodes which you may not be familiar with, so hopefully we can demonstrate something new today. But some material optimizations can give you a really good win in your project. So the first thing you want to be doing is building parent materials that then you create material instances from. So we won't be going over how to create material instances in this course. There are other courses on material instances. However, just the concept of building a parent material that houses all the material instructions, that will be your main base material. And then from that material, you can right click in your content browser and create a material instance from that parent material. And therefore you can edit the individual parameters of that parent material without recompiling the entire material. So for example, if you made a transparent glass material shader and then you had a parameter on that parent material called glass color, for example, you can then create multiple instances of that glass without recompiling the parent material. And you can change the glass color from green to a goldish, mustardy color, etc. without recompiling. So for your material pipelines, it's really good to get into the practice of having a parent material that houses all the instructions that you need and then just instancing off that parent material so that the majority of the materials in your map are actually instance materials rather than the parent material. Moving on to some material switches. You can get a static bool in your material if you'd like. So you can actually decide to switch based on a given parameter here and then render the output. So you can edit these switches at runtime. So you can actually call in this instance, be enabled base color texture. And if you enable that, then it will turn green. So maybe you might use this for an optimization pass. So you want to set everything to just render this luminous green just to check what textures are being used where that might be a good use case for that. You can also get a static switch, which has a similar effect. So whether we're picking A or B, we can still enable this at runtime if we would like. Another good useful switch there. And then we can also get a mask switch. So if you would just want to mask a certain channel from a mask that you might have packed with RG and B, you can just mask based on a specific channel as well. We have some quality expression nodes. So we've got a shading path. So do you want to change the texture or whatever you might be inputting into this node, dependent on the rendering model that you're using? So especially if you're trying to work across multiple platforms with maybe you've got deferred on by default and then you want to change it to a forward rendering, maybe for a VR application or you want a mobile application, you can change the shading path and therefore the instruction count of that material based on the renderer that you're using. Again, we can have a feature level switch. So we could use these within the materials. Say you want these different switches inside your game to say, okay, I want to go at this level of detail, for example, for SM5 and SM6. Okay, we'll set this. And it's almost like when we're using those texture groups and we were saying, okay, batch all these into this setting, you can actually decide on a larger scale in your materials, which feature level you want to select. Depending on your texture quality, you can say, okay, if we're running a super low texture quality or even a high texture quality, use this type of color. If we're running on medium or epic, for example, use this type of texture sample. So maybe the texture has been imported at a different resolution. Maybe you want to make some affordances for the amount of information going in from a low quality switch to a higher quality switch. That quality node is available for you there. And then also you have a ray tracing quality switch. So if you want to support ray traced materials and non-ray traced materials in the same project, but you want to make some affordances for someone that might not have ray tracing enabled, then you can have different outputs based on whether ray tracing is enabled there.",
