  "text": " If we're now ready to start sharing our scene in a way that goes beyond simply packaging this as a Windows executable, for example, we might want to send some screenshots or actual movies. And so let's start with screenshot. Let's say we find a moment here that we particularly like. We want to share it with a colleague. At any time, we can hit the drop down here and choose high resolution screenshot. And multiply this, though I generally wouldn't go beyond three. So if we are using, say, 1920 by 1080, two would be 4K and then three would be 8K. So be careful about that. And then note you also have a few options about using the date and timestamp as the image name. We can also specify a particular region instead of everything we have here. But I'll go ahead and choose two. And I'll hit the capture button. And I'll see right here the location where the screenshot gets saved. Inside my project folder, saved screenshots, windows. And there it is. You'll notice that the resolution here is twice what I actually have here in my viewport. So even if I'm ultimately targeting, for example, 1920 by 1080, the high resolution screenshot resolution will be dependent on what you currently actually have in your viewport at this resolution. I feel it's also worth noting that sometimes if you're just trying to compare and contrast something or just grab something very quickly, it's also not a terrible idea to just use the Windows snip tool sometimes and just grab what you need there and maybe just copy and paste that into an email or whatever you might need there. And moving on from screenshots, there's a few different ways we can export our actual project as a video. First up is the legacy method. And you'll notice that here if we hit the drop down, we have two options for rendering a movie with our little action slab here. We have movie render queue and movie scene capture legacy. Just to very briefly go over movie scene capture legacy. This was the older method and just had a few quick options for, for example, executing this as an AVI as well as some image types, whether or not you wanted audio, what frame rate you want to use by default, we're using 30 frames per second, which is the project. And then you can pretty safely go up to 4K, but nothing beyond that for the resolution here. And then we can burn in some options, though the default burn in widget here is pretty simple. We'll see a better burn in in a moment. Texture streaming, you'll generally want to disable because you run the risk of texture popping, though if you're on a lower end machine, you might crash your graphics card because it does need to hold textures in RAM. Compression of course is important if you're using AVI. No matter what, if you're exporting as an AVI, it's going to be pretty large and we'll just see that in a moment. So I'll leave this at its defaults with compression 75, but you won't be able to use H264 for example, if you're using this movie render setup. The output directory by default will be very similar to the high resolution screenshot directory saved video captures. Game mode override, we could for example use the movie pipeline game mode, which would just make sure to disable things that might be more specific to a game. Quite existing important if you are going to be re-rendering multiple times and don't want to end up with duplicates of your frames. Use separate process can be useful if you are trying to have this not affect the actual running of your scene. And then we also have some options for having this interface well with Final Cut Pro. Cinematic engine scalability of course reflects the setting over here, cinematic. So even if you're operating in the editor, again maybe on a lower end machine with perhaps a medium scalability, you can still, and it is by default, tell Unreal Engine to use cinematic mode for when it's actually doing an export. And then you have some options if you're for example using ray tracing, you can use the path tracer. And if maybe you're actually trying to show something that feels more like a game, you could also show the HUD, show player pawns, allow movement while the render is happening, but typically you'll want to leave those off. Lastly for the animation itself, you can use a custom start or end frame, and if not it will do the entire green to red play area in here. Warm up frame count can be useful if you have for example some effects that are going to be turning on and off. And delay before warm up similarly, all the warm up and delay is basically intended to make sure that particles, lighting, exposure, anything like that is just going to look correct by the time you get to frame zero. And let's just go ahead right now and we'll leave it at that 1280 by 720 resolution and hit capture movie. I'll go ahead and save everything. And we can see it rendering, not at its full resolution in a little separate window. And when capture is finished, we'll see a message and we can click open capture folder and see this AVI. Let's go ahead and open it, just take a look. And here we can see it playing back. Notice we have a few glitches. Notice that we have some fairly poor anti-aliasing and pretty severe compression artifacts. I'm pointing all this out because we'll be improving all of these in a moment with the movie render queue. But I do still find myself using the legacy movie render option sometimes if I'm just trying to get a quick preview. So bear in mind the quality of that video and in the next video we'll switch over to using the movie render queue.",
