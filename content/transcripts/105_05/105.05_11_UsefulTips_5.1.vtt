00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
And then before we close out, let's look at some useful tips for getting started with

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.120
your project. So as we spoke about before, creating subscene tracks is going to be super

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.719
useful for working with multiple people on these shots and these sequences. So whether

4
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:22.960
you want to organize per department, maybe have character animation effects, lighting,

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.480
etc. You can essentially nest the storyboard sequences into a standard level sequence.

6
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.480
Then we can kind of go through the layering, almost like bread crumb in to get the functionality

7
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.359
quickly moving between the subscene tracks. So trying to open an sd storyboard sequence

8
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:48.640
will crash Unreal Engine. So that's also worth noting. So just check your current engine version.

9
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.079
This may not be the case, but just make sure you're saving your content as you go will

10
00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.799
be something good to do moving forward. So the subscene tracks can then be expanded into

11
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.120
given sublayers. So you may have, as we said before, this character animation track, for

12
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.280
example, and then you may have sub sequences that are per character type, for example, you can get

13
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.599
as granular or as high level as you want. So we just want to consider subscene tracks for the

14
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.799
various elements. Just don't add subscenes for your storyboards. As we mentioned before,

15
00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:34.079
that could cause some crashing for you. It's also worth noting that E-Post storyboard does

16
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.639
not support spawnable actors at this time. So if you see actors in your content browser or your

17
00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:49.599
world outliner that are like this, they've not got the lightning icons, then that's what you want.

18
00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:55.199
If you see any kind of cameras that are being spawned at runtime, which is what this lightning

19
00:01:55.199 --> 00:02:02.079
icon means, then E-Post isn't going to be aware of them. So you just want to add all the actors

20
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.759
into your scene to be using with these sequences. And then maybe you want to set some useful hot

21
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.439
keys here. As you begin working with these tools more, you'll find your own workflow,

22
00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:23.120
but here are a few to get you started. And then we've got a couple more here. So just a quick

23
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.359
note here, E-Post storyboarding requires the highlighted shortcut keys to be disabled or

24
00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:37.919
remapped. As we said at the start, it may just cause some conflicts with the default functionality.

25
00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:44.000
And then we've also got a couple more timeline tricks here. If you want to just get more familiar

26
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.520
with using a sequencer, and especially when you're editing a lot of shots, these kind of tools might

27
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.599
help on that journey. So there's a good white paper to read here, creating the Fortnite trailer. It

28
00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.599
just helps you understand the virtual production process of how these cinematics are created.

29
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.159
And a few extra resources here for you to dig into, some getting started guides and some

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:17.120
documentation. And all this course today was credited by Kevin Miller, Brennan Carroll,
