00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
And then before we get on to any tips and tricks, we'll talk about how to render your

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.160
sequences out.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.400
So let's look at rendering in sequence now.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320
So the animatic creation is super straightforward.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.640
We can just drag the board sequence actor into an empty level sequence and it will automatically

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.039
add the board sequence to a shot track that you're ready to render the finished animatic

7
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.039
with.

8
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.000
So we have two different tools that I'd disposal here.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.719
We have the movie render queue and the movie scene capture, which is a legacy tool which

10
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.480
is being deprecated, but it is also great for rendering out videos with AVI format.

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.920
So it's a general purpose capture for cinematic output supports custom render passes HDR export

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.000
but doesn't support high resolution scaling.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.719
So it's currently the only the option for AVI files.

14
00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.480
So that's what we'll go ahead and use that being said, if you're using future versions

15
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.280
of Unreal Engine.amp 5.1, just go ahead and check out what the current movie render options

16
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.359
are and use a tool that's most appropriate for what you need there.

17
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:17.840
So with the HDR exporting, we have got export HDR data in open EXR files.

18
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.319
We've got specify the HDR compression quality and then the capture gamut depending on what

19
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.920
you need.

20
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.200
And then also with the render passes, we limit render pass options.

21
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.159
So it is not render layers.

22
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.200
And then just a quick note on the bottom here, at least one render pass must be selected

23
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.900
or all render pass options will be rendered.

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.120
So this is what we end up with here.

25
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.880
I'll just play a quick sequence for you to see.
