00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
And then just to close out here, a big thank you for watching today's course.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.439
Hopefully it just was a good getting started guide on the E-Pass and Iliad tools, allowing

3
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.400
you to start thinking about how you would storyboard your projects, especially in this

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.839
kind of pre-production at this period of a project maybe.

5
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:28.120
You just want to figure out what tools were at your disposal, how to just get a very quick

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.760
iteration process going on in your project.

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
So hopefully that pointed you in the right direction.

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.200
Some cool tools to get you started.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.120
So thanks again for watching and we'll see you on the next course.
