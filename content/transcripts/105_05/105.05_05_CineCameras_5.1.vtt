00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
To work with these storyboarding tools, we also need to understand how to work with cameras

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.919
inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.880
So we have two different types of cameras.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.919
We have the Cine Camera Actor, which is the most commonly used.

5
00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:21.800
It's a camera that emulates real-life cameras, not unlike a game camera, but we have more

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.039
options such as the film back, lens, focus, and tracking options.

7
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.320
So if you're unsure what Cine Camera Actors are, plenty of documentation on these, and

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.840
it's definitely worth looking into all the different options that they have, you can

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.679
just find that from the Place Actors window in the Cinematics tab, and you're looking

10
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.359
for the Cine Camera Actor there.

11
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.599
We also have Scene Capture Component 2D, which is used to capture a snapshot of the scene

12
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:52.799
from a single plane and then feed that into a render target.

13
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.519
So if you're trying to render just a certain frame, this may be the option to go to there.

14
00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.000
So with the Cine Cameras, we have these film back settings, which essentially sets the

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
aspect ratio.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.560
So you can see the film back here with the sensor, width and height, and then it gives

17
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.799
you some form of aspect ratio based on the width and height values.

18
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.879
You've got your lens settings where you can set focal lengths and S-stops, focus settings

19
00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:27.239
where you can track certain actors, whether it be a manual tracking or an actor tracking,

20
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.079
and then just a whole host of other properties.

21
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.560
So again, if you're unfamiliar with what Cine Camera Actors are, it's definitely worth

22
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039
checking out the documentation.

23
00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.319
Also just dragging and dropping a Cine Camera Actor into your scene, playing around with

24
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.759
the different properties can help you understand exactly what the different properties are

25
00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.759
doing within your project.
