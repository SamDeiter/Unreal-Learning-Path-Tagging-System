1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
And the two tools we'll be looking at most of here are the E-POS and ILLIAD tools.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.580
So they're used for storyboarding within Sequencer.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.160
We have an Epic MegaGran recipient and partner with Praxinus, which provides additional tools

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.800
that expand Unreal Engine capabilities, including using Sequencer to generate content for storyboards

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.080
and animatics.

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.280
So to get started, we need to grab the free E-POS and ILLIAD plugins from the marketplace

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.400
on the Epic Games launcher.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.880
We want to make sure they're enabled.

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.579
To open the plugins window, you just go to edits at the top of your editor, go down to

10
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.719
plugins, which is at the bottom of the page.

11
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.079
And then you just want to enable these two plugins.

12
00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.480
Potential recommendation here as well is you could enable the stylus and tablet plugin

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.159
when using either Wacom or non-wacom tablet devices and it'll make that storyboarding

14
00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.040
process much more straightforward.

15
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.640
You may have to restart your editor as well and then upon restarting, you'll have access

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.480
to the tools that we'll be talking about here today.

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.239
So a few editor preferences that you might want to set here.

18
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:15.599
If you just go to your editor preferences, again found under the edit bar at the top

19
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.519
of your editor, go down to editor preferences and if you just type in Sequencer in that

20
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.640
search bar at the top, you'll be able to find some shortcuts that we're wanting to set here.

21
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.920
And so we want to disable the up, down, left and right movements in the shortcut settings

22
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.079
and just kind of try and mirror your settings as what we have here.

23
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.219
And then we also have the project setting where you can get fine project settings.

24
00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.799
Again alongside where the plugins and editor preferences are, go to edit, project settings

25
00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.879
and we want to enable the support UV from hit results.

26
00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.239
So if you just type in hit in the project settings, you'll be able to find this setting

27
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:06.280
here and then you'll just want to restart your editor again.

28
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.919
So Sequencer is a non-linear editing assembly tool.

29
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.639
You can create shots through the use of Sequencer.

30
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.400
We can create full film creation via Sequencer.

31
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.120
We do a lot of pre-visualization, which we'll be talking about here today.

32
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.360
And we also use it for game cinematic creation.

33
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.159
So if you're unsure what Sequencer is, it's a really powerful tool.

34
00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:38.240
It's well worth knowing and diving into for what you might need for your projects.

35
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.480
If you are unfamiliar with what Sequencer is, definitely check out that documentation

36
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480
link at the bottom of the page here.

37
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.040
There's a whole host of documentation sub pages there and a lot of tutorials to go from

38
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
with Sequencer.

39
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.439
And essentially what we can see here is we can see we've got a series of actors from

40
00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.759
our scene that we've created.

41
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.960
So if we've got an eagle in the scene and we've got a meerkat in the scene, you can

42
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.319
see that we've added our actors from the scene into Sequencer.

43
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.120
And we'll maybe play an animation on those actors.

44
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.719
You can see that there's an animation track.

45
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.280
We also can set some kind of events from here.

46
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.680
So we're setting the visibility of the eagle for certain shots here.

47
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.000
So we can add and compose all these different actors essentially into the Sequencer to create

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.599
level sequence assemblies, which is the kind of key phrase that we're looking at here today.

49
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:49.759
So then when we look at this sequence in relation to how we might be approaching today's session,

50
00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.439
you'll see that we have the eagle and the meerkat in the scene here.

51
00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.560
And you can see as we scrub through, you can see the animation, the camera, the different

52
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.000
shots that set up.

53
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.639
And so that is the overall cinematic.

54
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.159
So that's the overall level sequence.

55
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:14.359
And what we can do here, we can nest the different sequences in a certain hierarchy for either

56
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.560
multiple people to be editing, to keep the content modular so you can move it around.

57
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.240
And so if you think of your overall film as this master sequence, this overall level sequence,

58
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.600
which is what we can see on the left hand side here, we can have some sequences, sometimes

59
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.680
referred to as sub sequences, which is maybe certain characters in a subsequence.

60
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.720
Maybe you can have a subsequence for all the audio that you put into the level.

61
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.840
You can have a subsequence for all the visual effects that you put in.

62
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.439
You can have various types of sequences, and it's up to you how you kind of handle and

63
00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.160
organize that content.

64
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.280
But essentially it keeps it more modular and keeps it able to multiple people to work on

65
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.519
the same kind of film in one session.

66
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.959
So you can have multiple people per department, for example.

67
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:18.039
And then we can be working per shot where you can see we've got certain naming convention

68
00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.439
set up so that people can be then double clicking on each one of these shots to open up the

69
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:30.560
expanded editor to really dial in a certain performance or we need some key audio add-in,

70
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
something like this.

71
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.639
So there's kind of a nested hierarchy going into this.

72
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.839
We can use this all in the take system, which we'll talk about in a few moments here.

73
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:50.639
So you can see how previously we were looking at sequencer without the E-POS tools available.

74
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.639
Now let's look at sequencer with the E-POS as a storyboarding generator tool.

75
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.039
So actors in the viewport or assets in the content browser are generated directly from

76
00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.979
the sequencer to create level sequence assemblies.

77
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.620
So as before, they were added if we look, actors from the viewport or assets from the

78
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.460
content browser added into the sequencer.

79
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.620
So here we say they are generated.

80
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.540
So we add them all within sequencer to be viewed with this E-POS storyboard generator.

81
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:37.500
So we can see per shot here, we are generating various assets for the sequencer, again, for

82
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.300
this pre-visualization kind of storyboarding iterative approach.
