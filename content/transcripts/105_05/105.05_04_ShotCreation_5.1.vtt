00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
And so with that context in mind, let's look at how we might approach some shot creation.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.560
So first of all, we want to add a level sequence.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.800
We want to go to the drop down.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.760
We can add level sequence and we can just put that in a new folder here.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.120
So from the main toolbar, we can click that Cinematics button, add level sequence, and

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.640
then we can click on the Add Import button, go to the Animation option, find level sequence

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.440
as well.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.399
Or you can just right click in the content browser, go to Animation Level Sequence.

9
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.799
So there's two or three different ways you can actually add the level sequence, but essentially

10
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:47.600
all routes lead to just creating a level sequence within your content browser, which we can

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
open up.

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.040
So once you've got a level sequence, maybe name it master underscore sequence or something

13
00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.359
along those lines of the naming convention, and then we're okay to get started.
