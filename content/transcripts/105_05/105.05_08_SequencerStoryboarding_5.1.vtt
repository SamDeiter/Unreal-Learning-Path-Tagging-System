00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
Now that we have our tools set up, now let's look at how we might begin the storyboarding

2
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.080
process inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.439
So let's look at how we create this first storyboard.

4
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.240
So to get started, we want to create a board.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.640
So we have this drop-down option here, and we want to start storyboarding.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.879
Again, if you can't see these options, it may be because you've not got the correct

7
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.280
plugins enabled.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.920
So you just want to restart your editor.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.520
Again, if your plugins aren't there, and then select Start Storyboarding to create

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.600
a new board sequence asset.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.000
So additionally, we can also import the image sequences directly to Unreal.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.280
But for this purpose, we're just going to drop down from the cinematic and start storyboarding.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.719
So in starting out with a new board sequence, there are a few settings you want to change

14
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.000
here that can modify.

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.640
And then once you get familiar with those, you can dial them in for whatever you would

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.799
like for your given project.

17
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.039
So we want to adjust the root board for your project.

18
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.560
So the name and path you want to set those into the desired locations.

19
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.599
And then in the naming conventions tab, you have the global settings here, and then also

20
00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.079
the board naming convention fields.

21
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.400
So however you would like to set those up for your projects needs, you can use those.

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.480
And then we also have the shot plane and the camera naming within these different headings

23
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
here.

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.760
And then starting out, it is OK to leave these as defaults.

25
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.640
But as you get more familiar with these tools, you'll be able to dial them into exactly what

26
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
you need.

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.920
So you have a couple more options here in the sequence and sequence r tabs.

28
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.320
If you do want to update any of these settings here.

29
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.400
So that's it.

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
Thank you.

31
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
Bye.

32
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
Bye.

33
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400
Bye.
