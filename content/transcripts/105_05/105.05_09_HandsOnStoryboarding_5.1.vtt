00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Now that we've gone over the Brush Setup properties, let's get hands on and talk about

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.839
layout and storyboarding inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.640
So let's open our editor and then inside our editor, I want to create a new folder.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.519
It's up to you how you organize these folders.

5
00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.480
The folder name isn't necessarily relevant here.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.160
I've just called it EPOS.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm going to right click in some empty space.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.719
I'm going to go to Animation and Level Sequence.

9
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.640
These are the steps that we spoke about at the start of the course here.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm just going to call it SEQ for Sequencer, underscore master, underscore 01, something

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.799
like this.

12
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.359
Again, the naming convention doesn't really matter for this purpose, but I'm just going

13
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.920
to create a new level sequence and then I will open that up.

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.159
I will also go to the drop down at the top and I will click Start Storyboarding.

15
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.519
So we'll click this.

16
00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.439
And this is our properties that we spoke about before.

17
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.079
So you can name it My Storyboard 01.

18
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.799
You can call it the name of whatever project you're currently working on.

19
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.599
You can set a desired path.

20
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.239
If you want, I'm going to select the EPOS path.

21
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:16.680
But again, wherever you would like to put these files, studio name, you've got

22
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.640
board naming conventions.

23
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.719
Feel free to go into any of these properties as we spoke about earlier in the course

24
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.560
and edit those to whatever you would desire.

25
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.719
I'm just going to go ahead and click Create Storyboard for now though.

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200
So we've got our storyboard.

27
00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.040
We've got our boards here.

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.040
We can start thinking about adding a new shot.

29
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.920
So let's go ahead and click New Shot on the plus shot.

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.640
And we've got our shots here.

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.320
So we've still got our scene.

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.480
We've got our sequence, the layout, but we've not got any cameras.

33
00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.359
The first thing we want to do is to go ahead and add a camera.

34
00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.079
So we can do that by clicking this button here, Create New Camera.

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.359
And you can name your camera, whatever name and conventions you like to use.

36
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.680
You can change the film back settings.

37
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.680
You can give the plane a name.

38
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.919
Again, I won't worry too much about naming conventions for this quick demonstration.

39
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.120
But of course, when you're working on a larger project, you'll want to set up

40
00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.400
naming conventions in advance.

41
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.800
I'm going to go ahead and create a new camera and its plane here.

42
00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.159
And you can see that we're piloting the camera.

43
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.199
And we can see the camera here.

44
00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.319
I'll just zoom in on this storyboard sequence by holding down Control

45
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.439
and mouse wheeling over there.

46
00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.319
I can also hold Shift and mouse wheel backwards and forwards.

47
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.719
That helps navigate the space.

48
00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.439
But essentially, this is our this is our shot here.

49
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.759
And now we want to start thinking about how to draw using this plugin.

50
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.039
To do that, we go to the top left here on Select Mode.

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.319
And you'll see that we have this now shift to Iliad as an option.

52
00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.359
So we can select here.

53
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.719
By default, this is the window that opens.

54
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.359
You want to give yourself a bit of real estate.

55
00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.399
On in your editor, because we want a few different options open here.

56
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.599
So by default, we've got top bar that we want to click open.

57
00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.719
And that will give us access to a few useful properties here.

58
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.439
We've got the brush selector that we want to add.

59
00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.159
And I just I normally pin these down here.

60
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.240
This is the way I learned how to use the program.

61
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.039
And then also the layers tool, which I generally stack below the top bar

62
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.439
on the brush selector.

63
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.079
You want the layers to be in its own panel really,

64
00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.240
because you want the ability to quickly switch between layers.

65
00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.120
And then also tools is a useful window to have open.

66
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.640
Maybe just pin that on the right hand side for your fill tool

67
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.240
and to undo any other elements that you want to undo.

68
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.879
So these are generally the windows that you may use most often.

69
00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.480
Again, figuring out the real estate.

70
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.759
And maybe if you have a second monitor, you can create a better layout.

71
00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.480
But overall, this is these are the tools that you want open to start creating.

72
00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.560
And then when we have our plane, we can actually just start

73
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.280
the drawing process from whichever frame we want to look at.

74
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.399
So again, if we drew a little stick figure, I don't have a tablet plugged in.

75
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.040
So mind my mouse skills here.

76
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.800
You can see that I've drawn a little figure here.

77
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.120
And if we want to then add a new shot here, you can click the drawing.

78
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.160
And so I just click the drawing here.

79
00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.319
And maybe you've got someone over here.

80
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.120
Maybe that's the same person we want to show movement like

81
00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.120
like the ball over the net or something like this.

82
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.360
And what's interesting is then you can see the frames switching.

83
00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.600
And what's a really useful feature as well, if you click this little light bulb icon,

84
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.159
you can actually see the previous drawing you want.

85
00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.039
So if you want to.

86
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.360
Kind of toggle between a few frames and know where the previous frame was,

87
00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.319
you can use that light bulb mode there.

88
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.959
So of course, you can get into way more detail.

89
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.319
There's a lot of different options to jump into

90
00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.159
diving to all these different properties.

91
00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.439
And also if you are painting, you can show the background.

92
00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.719
If you're in a quite a busy scene, this scene is quite straightforward.

93
00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.639
But if you've got a busy scene and you want to alpha out more of the scene

94
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.079
and you want to block it out so you can really just focus on your drawings,

95
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.879
you can go ahead and do that.

96
00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.399
You can drop the alpha back down to see more of the screen.

97
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.399
And of course, you can change the grid as well, either the grid type.

98
00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:45.359
If this blue grid isn't what you want, you can change it into the third grid.

99
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.639
You can even change the grid color.

100
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.679
But there's so many properties in this plugin.

101
00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.000
You can really go to town on creating various shots, as we spoke about earlier

102
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.439
in the tutorial, but they're the quick settings to get up and running

103
00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.439
with drawing directly into your storyboard.

104
00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.560
And so hopefully that added some clarity on a bit of a hands-on demonstration

105
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.920
of how to use this plugin and now we'll move on to the next section.
