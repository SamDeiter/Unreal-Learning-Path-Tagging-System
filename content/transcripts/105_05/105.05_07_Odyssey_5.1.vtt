00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's look at working with the Odyssey brush debug.

2
00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:10.060
So to get started, before creating the brushes,

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.380
sorry to use the E-Post in Iliad,

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.460
we need to make sure everything works first

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.939
by creating a debug stamp.

6
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.300
We just wanna make sure all of our settings

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.859
are set in our project correctly before moving on

8
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.740
because you wanna introduce breakpoints

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.620
into this working method because if you get too far in

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.940
and then realize something's breaking,

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.100
you've gotta go back up the chain.

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.299
So let's just first start by creating

13
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:38.100
an Odyssey brushes folder.

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.299
We'll add two more folders,

15
00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.620
which is the brush library and the stamps.

16
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.659
And that's where we'll store any custom stamps

17
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.700
from the custom brushes.

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.980
So just a note here that the debug stamp

19
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.859
is a temporary brush to ensure that your tablet

20
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.620
is working properly in Unreal Engine.

21
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.820
So what we can do, we can right click

22
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.179
in the Odyssey brush folder to create a texture asset.

23
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.079
So if we can't see this Iliad menu,

24
00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.140
it means that the plugin isn't installed.

25
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.739
So just double check, go back to the top of the course here,

26
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.140
make sure that Iliad plugin is there,

27
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.280
restart your editor if need be,

28
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.900
and then you should be able to find this Iliad option

29
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.379
with the texture.

30
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.500
And we can rename this texture T underscore draw pad,

31
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.700
set the width and height to 1920, 1080,

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.260
change the color to white.

33
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.100
And then if you double click to open the T underscore draw pad

34
00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.140
texture, once you've created it,

35
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.579
that's where we'll be able to test our brush from.

36
00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.420
So we can also repeat this step in the brush library,

37
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.820
right click Iliad,

38
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.540
and then we wanna get the Odyssey brush here.

39
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.740
So we can rename the texture first brush,

40
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.900
so you can see a file type like this,

41
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.460
then double click to open it,

42
00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.299
and that's where we'll modify those parameters as well.

43
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.819
So the Odyssey brushes are used in the Blueprints Editor

44
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.139
Event Graph to modify the parameters of your brush,

45
00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.619
and you will be able to modify, customize,

46
00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.740
you know, rename the brush you create at any time,

47
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.740
just like any other U asset,

48
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.060
which is an Unreal asset inside the editor.

49
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.780
So we want to now, in the Event Graph of this basic brush,

50
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.659
we want to right click and type debug stamp,

51
00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.900
which you can see the debug stamp there,

52
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.180
and then we can right click event on step,

53
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.659
which you can see here,

54
00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.020
and then we just want to connect those two together.

55
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.620
You want to compile and save that blueprint,

56
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.300
and they, if you're unsure what they are,

57
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.219
they're the top two icons at the top left of your editor,

58
00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.140
you'll find one compile, one save,

59
00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.299
and you just want to make sure that's set up.

60
00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.179
So to test the brush,

61
00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.099
we can open the T-Basic stamp texture,

62
00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.419
just by double clicking it,

63
00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.500
select the debug brush in the brush selected tab,

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.379
and then we can just draw in the viewport,

65
00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.859
and you should be able to see that drawing.

66
00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.379
Now, if you're unable to see it,

67
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.739
maybe your Wacom driver's out set up,

68
00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.339
so again, you could go back to the top

69
00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.579
and enable that plugin that we mentioned,

70
00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.219
but essentially you should be able to draw and edit

71
00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.139
directly inside of Unreal Engine using these tools.
