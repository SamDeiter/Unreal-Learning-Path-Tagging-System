00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
So let's first look at what tools we have at our disposal when looking at storyboarding.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.060
So you can see here the typical storyboarding workflow.

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.800
We may have had some kind of idea and then we're going to some kind of previous department

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.679
and then go through the various departments and iterate on that through the pre-production

5
00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.679
cycle.

6
00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.600
So the storyboards here are created with some kind of hand-drawn drawings created with

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.200
the various 3D packages and then we iterate on them through this cycle.

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.520
So we go through story dev, production design, interblocking, create some form of story reel

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520
from that.

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.880
Maybe we go back into blocking based on some feedback that we get and then through to the

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
editorial.

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.920
Now, the interesting thing about the approach that we're looking at today is that it's

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.359
a much more iterative process through each of the different cycles that we're looking

14
00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:59.359
at.

15
00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.480
We're constantly kind of iterating based on the storyboards that we can see within the

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.000
different shot setups and the way we kind of construct this whole pipeline here.

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.599
So by introducing the E-Pars and Iliad tools from Praxinus, we will move the pre-production

18
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.599
workflow for story and layout almost entirely into Unreal Engine.

19
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.640
So you can see the kind of more purple based icons where we would have traditionally kept

20
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.199
this offline from Unreal Engine where you can see now we've got some storyboard via the

21
00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:44.959
use of the plugin which we'll jump into in a few moments here.

22
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.439
You can see that the storyboarding is able to be done in Unreal.

23
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.639
We now have modeling tools and with the Iliad plugin as well and some rigging tools, we

24
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.200
were able to do some production design inside of Unreal Engine.

25
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.040
We're also just able to block whether it be performance capture, level layout and the

26
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.039
assembly tools using a sequence of which we'll jump into.

27
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.520
You can see there's a whole host of breakpoints in the cycle where we can have just this live

28
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.960
iteration via the use of Unreal Engine and some of the additional plugins that we'll

29
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.439
be looking at.

30
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.879
And so hopefully you'll be able to see that that whole cycle and process is much more

31
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.879
iterative.

32
00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.879
So let's jump into what that looks like now.
