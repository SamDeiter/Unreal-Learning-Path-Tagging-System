  "text": " Now that we've taken a look at the SimpleIK rig, we're going to see how the Full Body IK or FBIK within Control Rig compares, seeing why you'd use this and when it's a good idea to do so, and we'll cover the steps on how you might set one up for your own character. So what is the Full Body IK system or FBIK in Unreal Engine? Well the concept behind the system is exactly the same as the SimpleIK rig. So it is designed as a procedural adjustment tool, but this time to be used within Control Rig to give you an alternative solution for things like ground alignment or arm-reaching behaviour. And as with the SimpleIK rig, some of the primary reasons to use FBIK are things like maintaining contact, so keeping your feet on the ground or your hands on the table for example. You can also dynamically change the height of your character so you can force them to crouch by lowering the hips while their feet remain planted. And it's great for reaching a target like with the IK goals in the SimpleIK rig, adjusting the hand position for example when pressing a button. So now that we kind of understand that if it's designed to work in a similar way to the SimpleIK solution, then why would we use this over any of the other IK systems in the engine? Well there are a few reasons for that. With the FBIK solution within Control Rig, you get a greater range of motion and there are more settings available to you to tune your output pose. So when using a single chain IK, if you reach the end of the chain length, the goal can no longer be reached and the chain will just lock up. And when using FBIK, you can engage the whole body to move the route and reach those goals. It also has multiple effectors, so there may be times when you need multiple contact points to be maintained at the same time or even at different times, which may only be possible if the solver is allowed to move the route of the character. And when it comes to the torso or spine of your character, if you're using a single IK chain, you can't guarantee a great spine pose, so using a full body IK system to engage the whole body is going to give your character a much better final pose. When you're using the FBIK system within Control Rig, remember that it's something that is meant to operate on top of your existing animation and not generate something from scratch, so you can't expect it to fix bad inputs or bad posing. If your rig scenario doesn't require a full body IK system, do continue to just use single IK chains, because there's no sense in having a full body system running if it's not necessary. And as with any IK setup, don't start with perfectly straight limbs. Make sure that things like your elbows and your knees have a slight bend in them, so that the IK solver can calculate the default bending direction correctly. Something to try and avoid as well is to increase the iterations that the solver is performing to compensate for any bad setup. Make sure to just take your time adjusting the settings to suit your character, giving you the output pose that you want. And make sure never to pull your character outside of the capsule, because this will likely end up with your character misaligning from their collision and could cause things like your character going through walls and other meshes.",
