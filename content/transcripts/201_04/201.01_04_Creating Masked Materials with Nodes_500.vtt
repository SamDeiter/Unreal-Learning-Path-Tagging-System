00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
So stepping up the complexity a tiny bit here, we'll talk about creating masked materials

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.040
with some nodes. So we want to cover the process of how you might create a masked material.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.380
We'll talk about using minus nodes and clamps, and we'll also use the lerp node to linear

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.040
interpolate between two different channels of the material that we want. We can talk

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.060
about masking textures for materials using one texture, and we'll also talk about using

6
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.940
the RBG RGB channels to almost get a more performant texture based on a specific channel

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.580
rather than the overall texture. So let's jump into this. So we've got the process.

8
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.140
There are two ways that can be achieved when we're talking about masked materials. So with

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.380
an outside alpha embedded in a texture, or you can do it in a standalone texture that

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.780
has an alpha data plugged into opacity. You can also do this through the color channels,

11
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.620
which we were talking about with the RGB material setup. So when you create a texture

12
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.340
sample, you'll have an alpha pin on the texture sample, which is the main output, and then

13
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.620
it's the RGB, and then you've got an A. So anything imported with some kind of opacity,

14
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.080
a 32 bit alpha channel, you can use that alpha to plug into one opacity of the material.

15
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.460
You can even just pull in a specific channel, whether it's the green channel, the red channel,

16
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.300
the blue channel, to have an alphaed material as well, depends on what you packed into that

17
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.380
texture sheet to begin with. But suffice to say, there's a number of ways that we can

18
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.060
achieve creating a masked material. And it's up to your kind of preference and also just

19
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.300
workflow of how you're trying to pack textures together on the approach that you want. When

20
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.260
we're looking at a material setup that we want for thinking about masked materials,

21
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.460
we'll use the minus nodes and some clamps here as well. So we'll create or use a black

22
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.260
and white texture, which we provided in the project, and you can create a texture sample.

23
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.860
So a nice little shortcut here is if you do use the texture that was given in the project

24
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.340
or anything that's already in your content browser, you can have that selected in your

25
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.180
content browser. Don't double click it, you can just select it. You can come into the

26
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.100
material and if you press T on your keyboard and left click, it will first of all create

27
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.380
a texture sample, but it'll also automatically apply the texture that you had selected in

28
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.140
your content browser. So it's just a nice quicker way of working. Again, you could always

29
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.780
just press T or just right click, add a texture sample and then select the texture after the

30
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.700
fact. It doesn't matter either way, but it's just a little bit more streamlined way of

31
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.700
working. Next, we want to create a one minus if we need to flip the masking effect. So

32
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.300
this is our one minus and it'll essentially just flip to the opposite. So if you've got

33
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.100
Alfred on the outside and the solid colors on the inside, the one minus will then flip

34
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.780
it to translucent outside and opaque on the inside. So it'll just basically flip the effect

35
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.180
that you're going for, which you can see this one minus doing there. So instead of importing

36
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.540
a brand new texture that does the same thing, but in the opposite way, we can actually just

37
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.380
dial that in based on the material, which, you know, reduces the amount of texture samples

38
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.820
you might need in your project, which is really useful for having that flexibility. So we've

39
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.980
done this to make some kind of gold trim on the material. Next, we'll create a clamp to

40
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.980
keep things in range if parameters are introduced for control. So if someone programs into your

41
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.980
shader, they will see that they have a clamp to keep things in a nice certain range. So

42
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.420
that's just more of a quality control type of clamp that we've put in there to make sure

43
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.900
we're getting the desired effect. We can also use Lerp nodes, which is a linear interpolate.

44
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.340
So you can just right click, add Lerp. You'll likely see that it's called linear interpolate

45
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.580
as well. And so we'll create a Lerp node and run the one minus into the alpha input of

46
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.420
the Lerp. And then we want to duplicate that process for the material texture. So when

47
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.460
we talk about duplicating the process, you can actually select these nodes, Ctrl C to

48
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.780
copy, Ctrl V to paste, and just work a little bit more efficiently there. So you just want

49
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.260
to notice that there's not a metal texture for the wood. So we can plug in a constant

50
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.540
into the Lerp. So this is the setup that we're going for here. You can see that we've got

51
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.180
that const going into the A, we've got the texture sample going into the B, and where

52
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.900
the alpha is actually based on this texture sample here. And then when we talk about masking

53
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.060
textures for materials using one texture, you can actually see that we've got, if you

54
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.060
go into your texture and you click through the RGB channels, you'll see there's different

55
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.380
information packed into the various channels. And we can actually just pull off, say the

56
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.300
green pin or the red pin in this instance, to get specific information from that channel.

57
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.420
So if in your external app, you've either painted or included some information onto

58
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.260
a specific channel, instead of just using the main RGB channel, if you're layering stuff,

59
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.420
for example, in Photoshop, you can just pull off that information in the RGB channel, or

60
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.700
even the alpha channel, and use that. And so we call that texture packing. You can pack

61
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.420
multiple textures into one texture when importing it into Unreal. And it's just a slightly more

62
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.420
efficient way to work if you especially if you're trying to keep the texture sample instructions

63
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.700
down to a minimum. So go ahead and follow through those steps, you can create a mass

64
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.260
material, play around with the type of masking approach that you'd like. Again, we kind of

65
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.980
noted two or three different ways that you could create a mass material based on the

66
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.580
samples. And again, it's going to be project specific, depending on what you're trying

67
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.580
to achieve. But hopefully that gives a good overview to the mass materials. And also just

68
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.660
to add at the end of this that we want to credit to Frick for the scene shown in the

69
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.540
RGB channel. And then we've also got a documentation on how to mask materials if you'd like to

70
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.300
dig into that topic further.
