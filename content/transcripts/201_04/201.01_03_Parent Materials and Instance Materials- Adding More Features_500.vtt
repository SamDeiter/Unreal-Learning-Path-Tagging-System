00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
Next, we'll talk about the difference between parent and instance materials and how to add

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800
a few more features to those functionalities as well. So we'll review parent materials

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.840
and instance materials to begin with. We'll talk about creating some switch parameters

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.360
for instance and so you can really dial in the result of what you want a specific instance

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.920
to look like. And we'll talk about creating a master material, a UV control for instance

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.080
So let's just review the parent materials and the instance in concept. So when to use it and what

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.920
and why is it useful? So you'll see that we have parent material on the right hand side here. We've

8
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.000
got color value. In this example, we've decided to create a metallic value and also a roughness

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.280
value. And we've plugged those into the respective inputs. Now you'll see that these are all

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.720
parameters. You'll see in the slight italicized text below, it says param, param, and param. And

11
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.320
that essentially means it's a parameter that we can use to change the result outside of the parent

12
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.320
material. So on the left hand side here, you'll see an instance version of this material. And on

13
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.960
the top properties, you'll see that we've got the albedo ticks, we've got the normal ticks,

14
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.320
and we've got the roughness ticks. And we can dial in these values based on the instanced

15
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.520
version of that. So we've created one material here that has parameters that we can change. And on

16
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.640
the instance, we can make subtle tweaks and shifts. Sometimes we want to make large shifts

17
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.080
and tweaks. But essentially, you don't have to create a material from scratch. You can just

18
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.480
change the values that you wanted to change based on the parameter of the master parent material.

19
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.160
So we can think about adding a little bit more functionality to these materials. The previous

20
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.160
example was a little bit more of a basic that you'd expect to see in any given Unreal project. Now

21
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.800
let's think about how we might switch based on some of these parameters. So we can import a desired

22
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.160
texture, whatever you'd like, and we'll prompt you at the end of this section to create your own.

23
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.760
So if we just go through the notes to begin with, and then you can pause the video and try and

24
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.200
recreate this yourself. So you import some kind of desired material, we'll right click and search

25
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.320
for a switch parameter. So if you just right click in the material graph, type in switch parameter,

26
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.840
you'll have a static switch parameter that will appear there. And then you just want to select

27
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.040
that. And then we can create several constraints and plug them into the false node. So if you

28
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.800
want to create a const, you can hold down one on your keyboard and left mouse click and that will

29
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.240
create a const one. Alternatively, you can just find the constants in the right click menu.

30
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.760
Scale parameters, in a similar way, scale parameters are constants nodes that have been

31
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.840
converted to a parameter. So once we've created that const, so we maybe held down number one on

32
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.000
our keyboard, we left clicked, you can actually right click on that new node that you created and

33
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.320
convert it to a parameter. And therefore you'll then be able to give it a name. By default,

34
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.160
it'll just be a numerical value. But if you want it to be a parameter, you can right click and

35
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.480
convert that to a parameter. So we want to convert all the texture sample nodes to parameters,

36
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.200
including any constants parameters, they will now become scalar parameters for you to assign

37
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.360
names to that we'll be able to communicate with in an instance version of this material.

38
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.600
If we want to think about creating a master material with UV control, let's maybe add a UV

39
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.160
coordinate. So just right click UV coordinate. And this is a text coordinate in this example,

40
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.200
we want to create two multiply expressions. So we've got one multiply here, one multiply there,

41
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.640
you can actually hold down M for multiply on the keyboard. And to create a multiply there,

42
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.280
we can create an append expression, we can create three scalar parameters, again, just holding down

43
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280
one on the keyboard for each one and convert them to a parameter, and then connect them to each

44
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.800
texture UV desired. So just a note on this last section here, you'll see the comment box there

45
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.040
as well. But the last multiply acts as a bridge and can be an ad instead. So if you'd like to

46
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.640
create an ad instead of a multiply, you can do that. And it will simply shift the UVs whilst

47
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.280
multiply shifts and increases the scale. So keep in mind and depends on the design effect of what

48
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.160
you would like your material to look like. To create the instance version of the material,

49
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.160
so we've got this new material in our content browser, you'll see it wherever you created it

50
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.080
in the folder, you can actually right click on this master or parent material and create a

51
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.800
material instance based on that parent material. When you do a new material will be created,

52
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.080
but it'll be a material instance instead of an actual just master material. And we can load up

53
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.640
this instance and you'll see some kind of box like this, it'll have different parameters based

54
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.400
on what you had created in the previous example. But it'll allow you to tick certain parameters on

55
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.520
and off of the properties that you want to edit based on the material that you're trying to create.

56
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.800
So instances are used to prevent constant recompiling of shaders because we've got this

57
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.360
parent or master material. That's what's doing all your shader compilation. It knows what to

58
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.960
expect from the PBR system that you're trying to create. And therefore every instance is just

59
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.440
based on that parent shader. So Unreal knows to calculate certain parameters and then it's just

60
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.200
dialing in the specific result that you want. So we can make the instance from the master material,

61
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.440
we can open the instance, click the nose to activate them, swap out any textures you would

62
00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.360
like and it gives you a lot more freedom and flexibility. And it's also just less performant,

63
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.960
well it's more performant but less heavy on performance to take this approach. So maybe

64
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.360
it's worth jumping in now into your editor. Maybe think about creating a new parent material with

65
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.920
some switch parameters. You could create the UV parameter control as we just went over in the

66
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.960
video. And maybe just test them out, test that workflow, see, get familiar with it. It's a concept

67
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.560
that you'll use in all your Unreal projects. It's just a very streamlined way of working,

68
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.640
it allows a lot of flexibility and it's just a useful pipeline to know and understand moving forward.
