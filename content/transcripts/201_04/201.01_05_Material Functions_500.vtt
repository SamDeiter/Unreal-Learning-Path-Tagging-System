00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
And then lastly, we just wanted to touch upon some material functionality, slightly more

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.000
complex again, but as you'll see, it's very straightforward if we're layering up these

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
approaches and learning about each step as we go. So we'll cover what material functions

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.960
are, we'll talk about using function inputs, we'll talk about building an animated material

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.900
function, and then we'll also use that material function in some form of master material.

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.900
So what is a material function? So material function allows you to embed materials within

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.340
materials, avoiding unnecessary clutter. It also just allows for reuse in various other

8
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.860
projects, packages, multiple materials. It's kind of reusing that functionality so you

9
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.260
don't have to keep creating or coding the same thing over and over again. So if you

10
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.140
get a really nice simple grass wind shader, for example, in this example, or you've created

11
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.460
a really nice water shader that you really want to reuse throughout your projects. Material

12
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.320
functions are a really nice clean way of saying, here's some complex piece of information.

13
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.740
I mean, it can be lightweight, but generally it'd be something a bit more complex, where

14
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.000
you've created this functionality and you can just use this as a function to plug into

15
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
an existing material to get the desired results. So you don't have to keep reworking existing

16
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.640
work. So we can use function inputs. So function inputs allow us to create some kind of customized

17
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.480
data, and we can edit the sorting priority, which allows control on where the new node

18
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.040
is and placed within the material function and the material destination. So how to create

19
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.440
this is that we want to first create a material function. And you can just do this by right

20
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.080
clicking in your content browser. Generally where you'd store other materials, maybe you'd

21
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.440
create a material function folder specifically, so you know where all your material functions

22
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.200
are. Again, it's just dependent on what your preferred workflow is. Essentially, you just

23
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.200
want to right click and go to materials and textures and create the material function

24
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.360
from there. Then you can open it up and create the system. So this is an in class exercise.

25
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.040
So we can go through this in the in class portion. However, even though there's a lot

26
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.200
of nodes going on, it's definitely not as hard as it seems. We provided samples. And

27
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.520
based on the previous example that we covered in the previous section, you can see that

28
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.160
it's a lot of copy and paste that information. So we've set up one section, and then we just

29
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.640
duplicated it and we're trying to dial in the desired results. So always just break

30
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.880
down the material to its component parts, kind of work backwards. And you'll see that

31
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.040
a lot of the information is then duplicated and replicated in different ways to achieve

32
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.640
this result. And so once we've created that material function, we can actually just use

33
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.560
that in a different master material now. So we can select the main material node and change

34
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.200
the material domain to light function. So this is the main material node here. So we

35
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.640
just want to click this pillar here of inputs. And you just want to on the on the left hand

36
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.400
side here, you'll see that we've got a light function material set up here. And that just

37
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.600
makes sure it cast shadows. You want to make sure that that's enabled. And then we can

38
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.440
call up the material function in the graph. And we can technically just drag it in. So

39
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.640
if you wanted to select it in your content browser and drag it in, or we want to specify

40
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.320
that we want to assign this MF four way motion or two, if that's what you called it in your

41
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.640
project. So by default, you'll just create a material function and then plug in the specific

42
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.520
function that you want into that node. Or you can drag and drop it in. So you just want to

43
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.640
for this example, you want to create a text quad and a scalar pram to multiply in the

44
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.360
material function. We've used all those before. And then we want to connect the caustic softer

45
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.240
texture to the texture node and then into the emissive. You'll see that we've only got the

46
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.160
emissive channel available to us now, because we went into that light function material

47
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.240
type. And so it just accepts emissive colors. So once we've done that, we can just connect

48
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.080
our light under the light function in the editor. And that should be working as some

49
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.120
kind of caustic style material in your editor. So just to cover that last section again,

50
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.640
when you have a light in your scene, all lights, if they're some kind of dynamic light, will

51
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.400
have a light function option. You can just plug this material into that light function in the

52
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.840
details panel. And that would add a caustic effect to the specific light. So if you follow

53
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.360
along in class and create this material function, master material that will give you a really

54
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.960
nice introduction to mass materials, again, slightly more complex concept. It's just getting

55
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.760
familiar with each module as you go. But you'll see that it's a lot of the replicated

56
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.480
information. You just build on upon your knowledge base. Try not to let it feel too complex and just

57
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.320
break it down to its component parts and just build from there. And then to close out here,

58
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.080
we've just got a few additional resources if you want to read up on any documentation. So whether

59
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.680
it's the introduction to materials, animating some UV coordinates, even just a high level

60
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.880
introduction to materials and material nodes, all that documentation is available to you.
