00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Let's start by talking about what is real-time PBR.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.960
So PBR is a unified light and shading system.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.120
It approximates light in real life behavior.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.380
So you can see these materials kind of reacting in the scene as you would expect that type

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380
of material.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.640
Maybe it either reflects a lot of light or absorbs light and doesn't have as much specularity.

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.800
You can dial in these values based on the material, regardless of the type of texture

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
that you're using.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.260
So we try to create something that's more physically accurate.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.720
So it uses real physical measurements such as lumens and looks and inverse square law,

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.720
energy conservation, etc.

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.880
And it's just a little bit more intuitive and consistent to understand when you're

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.320
creating your projects.

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.720
It also produces just a more accurate and natural look, as you can see in these images

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
here.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.640
When we talk about material concepts with PBR, we generally can divide the materials

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280
we build into metals and non-metals.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.200
So non-metals and metals on the right hand side here, you can see that we can create

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.960
the desired approach based on a type of material concept as seen in these images.

20
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.360
So if we're thinking first about base color, which we call an albedo map.

21
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.520
So non-metals, color info always have some kind of range.

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.280
There's no pure whites or pure blacks in nature.

23
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.360
So we want to keep in mind a roughness is a key in defining the look of a material

24
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920
as it's selling in the real world.

25
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.200
So you can see the non-metals here, we have some RGB values and sRGB values, and we might

26
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.520
be approaching if we want a non-metal concept, we might be approaching it more like this.

27
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.160
Whereas a metal concept, again, we'll be using just different information to get our PBR

28
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.880
material to react in a different way.

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.800
We have levels of metallic that we can change based on zero to one.

30
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880
So it's a grayscale value ranging from zero to one.

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.720
And the most common usage is either one or zero.

32
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.900
It is more binary in that respect.

33
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.480
So when on, it results in 100% specular reflection, as you can see on the right hand side of the

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.360
image here, zero would be on the left hand side, and you can see all the values in between.

35
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.120
Again, it's most common to use either zero or one kind of binary approach.

36
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.280
However, obviously, the results will depend on what effects you're actually going after.

37
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.280
We also have roughness masks, which is again a grayscale value ranging between zero and

38
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.880
one, but roughness materials will scatter the reflected light in more directions than

39
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.120
a smooth material might.

40
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.320
So if you want a more mirrored surface, that is on the zero end this time, a bit more reflective.

41
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.680
And then a more matted surface is going to be the one value here.

42
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.600
So again, you can dial it in from zero to one based on how rough you want that material

43
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600
to feel.

44
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.280
And then we've got a few credits here.

45
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.320
The room was created by Fabrice Bruehle and we've got some additional resources here on

46
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.800
physically based index.

47
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.440
If you want to dig into those.
