Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on materials and today we'll be

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.680
talking about masking and material functions.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
So we'll give you an overview of some material theory and talk about real-time PBR which

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.680
is physically based rendering and today the topics that we want to cover in this section

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.680
are just what is real-time PBR and how you might use it along with some material concepts.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.680
So let's get stuck in.
