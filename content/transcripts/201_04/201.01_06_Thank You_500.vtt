00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560
Hopefully that was a really good introduction to creating materials and thinking about some

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
of the more advanced properties of materials, whether we're talking about material functions

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.000
or even just parameters and parent materials and how to just instance those materials to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
create not only a cleaner workflow, but also just something that's more performing for

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.980
your projects.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.840
