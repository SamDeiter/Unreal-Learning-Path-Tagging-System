  "text": " Before we can begin to use the Niagara Fluids in our project we need to enable the Niagara Fluid plugin. Now this is pretty simple to do. All we need to do is go to the plugins menu, look for FX and then there is Niagara Fluid and we just enable it and restart the editor. I'm going to go ahead and do that now. So inside of my editor I'm going to come here to edit plugins, bring this on the screen here, go over to our FX and we're going to look for Niagara Fluids and we are going to enable that and then we're going to hit restart now. Once we have done that we are going to then right click in the content browser, go to Niagara system and then we will be able to select this little wizard here and if we click on Niagara Fluids we will then have the ability to see all of the different Niagara Fluids that we have access to. So let's just pop back over here to the editor and have a look at that now. So again hit control space. I'm going to disable my level filter, come up to my content, right click and then from the menu here select the Niagara system and we're going to go to Niagara Fluids and if we want we can go 2D, 2D liquid, 3D gas, 3D liquid and there is some shallow water is the last one I wanted to show you or we can look at all of them here and all we need to do to select one of these and use it as the basis is simply just select it and then hit create. Now once we do that behind the scenes what is actually going on here is our Niagara is built off of very very very complex inheritance and inheritance in our case is actually used to progressively add more and more functionality. So instead of all of the fluid behavior being done in one single module and we use that one single module to do everything we have it kind of split up like this. So we have our basic grid 3D gas emitter at the base here and then from that we have the grid gas control. So these are going to be controls that control this and then we further refine those. We have some controls for just a regular emitter and then we have some controls for our cinematic version or a higher quality version and then finally we actually have our Niagara system that we are going to be creating. So the Niagara system is what we just created here using one of these the you know the grid 2D flip hose or the 3D flip hose or something like that. That would be the Niagara system and that system again it's going to be made up of a collection of these different Niagara emitters. Now the reason I'm bringing this up is because inheritance or knowing that inheritance plays a functionality here is going to be a key to expanding upon these emitters in the future or it's just important to know that all of this stuff is built upon multiple emitters and not just one single massive emitter.",
