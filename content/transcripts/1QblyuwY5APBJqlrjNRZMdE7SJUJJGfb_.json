If you go to the Blueprints tab at the very top and click Open Level Blueprints, you'll see that this will show an event graph where you can enter in logic. With this, your whole level actually acts as your viewport, and all of the actors as components that you can have access to. So, you can program in logic in this event graph, which corresponds to everything that you have in your level. It's pretty easy to work with, but it does have some caveats. It's not as modular, because you're not making individual classes and containers that can be reused. Instead, it's very level dependent. So this does have some drawbacks, and it does have some advantages. It's easy to work with, but at the same time, it's not going to be easy to reuse.",
