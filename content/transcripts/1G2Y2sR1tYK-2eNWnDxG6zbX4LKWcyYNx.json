  "text": " Okay, so for this next section, we're going to take a look at how we can create a function that will essentially create our finger control FK setup forwards without having to do it manually. Once again, this is a part of the process of tidying everything up when it comes to creating our rigs. So let's take a look at what functions actually do. So basically, they can just take away some of the monotony and redundancy of tasks, just basically setting up the same thing over and over again. We're going to basically make a function that will handle this for us just like we would on a blueprint, essentially handle all these repetitive tasks. And we can use this function anywhere in Unreal, but also more than anything, it'll just keep everything nice and clean. So next up, we're just going to take a look at how we create these controls and set everything up. So let's go ahead and take a look at how we do that. So I'm just picking up from where we left last time. So let's take a look at how we set up, create the finger controls. And it's really easy. So one thing that I will note is that we're not going to make finger controls for the metacarpals. They might cause some stretching issues that we don't really want to see. So essentially, I'm going to create the FK setup just for the finger joints. So that's one thing to keep in mind. So I'm skipping these. You can do them if you want, but you'll probably see some awkward deformation if you're not too careful. So to do that, I'm just going to go one by one on the joints. And essentially, I'm going to press Control N to create a control. So index two, index three. And once I've done this, what I'm going to do is reparent things to make a bit more sense. So index two below index one and three below two. So basically, we have the same hierarchy as we see in our joints. So once again, just Control N, Control N and Control N for all of these. And two below one, three below two. Control N for all of these. And there you go. Pressing Control N on all of these. Last but not least, we've got the ring. And these are ordered alphabetically, so that's why the ring comes after the pinky. And we've got all that set up here. So you can see we've got the whole sort of red nose set up here. So let's go ahead and change this. So I'm going to select all of these controls. So I'm pressing Control for the first one, then Shift select the rest. And I'm going to change the shape to a box thick. And I'm just going to reduce the scale here to 0.3. Just so that they're big enough that we can see the fingers, but also... Sorry, small enough that we can see the fingers properly. And that they don't overlap too much, but big enough that we can still select them and actually use them. So we've got all our controls here. And we've got all our controls in our bone hierarchy, like we discussed in our previous course. So let's go ahead and grab the top control of each one of these in the hierarchy. And I'm just going to click and drag and just drag it right underneath our hand L controls, because this is the left side. And what I will do as well is just select all these controls and change the color to blue, since that's the kind of color coding that we're going for the left side. So you can see we've got our left side controls. And we need to do the same for the right side. So let's go ahead and do that real quick. So we've got... These here. So Ctrl N, Ctrl N, Ctrl N. And these luckily can just stay red since they're on the right side. That should be pretty quick and easy. And, you know, this is a little bit tedious to kind of do these one by one. But it's not too bad. So I've got everything set up here. Am I missing the index? No, I've got it there. So I've got everything set up here. So just like before, I'm just going to grab all of the top here. I'm going to drag them, in this case, to the right hand control. The children of the right hand. There you go. And we will grab all of these and we will just change them to box thick. And once again, the scale, if I lock it here, it'll be a bit easier. So set that to 0.3. Now you can see we've got controls on either side. All right. So now that we've got our control set up, this means that we'll be ready. I'll just make this a little bit bigger. But this essentially means that we'll be ready to set up our function to set up the forward kinematics. So in order to do this, let's go ahead to the My Blueprint section here. And I'm going to add a new function. So I'm going to press the plus button here. And I'm going to call this function finger FK setup. OK. And what do we need to do? So we need to first of all, add a couple of input variables. So we're going to add the controls and the bones to come into this because that's what we're going to need to work with. Right. So essentially what we're going to do for the FK chain is set up that the bones copy the transforms of these controls. And that essentially becomes a parent constraint that makes sure that the bones move with the controls. So we're going to need both the controls and the bones so that we can drive that connection. So to add an input variable, you can just go here in the input section and press plus. And I'm going to call this one, the first one here, it's going to be called finger controls. And importantly, this is going to be a rig element key. And we're going to make this an array because we're just going to grab all the bones. We don't want this to be a single controller comes in. We want all the controls to come in at once. So finger controls is our first one. And I'm going to add another input variable, which is going to be the finger bones. OK. So you got both. This is also a rig element key type. So what do we need to do? We're going to have to get the transform of the control. OK, so we'll just plug that in straight away. We'll get the transform of the control and we'll just set the transform. So we'll use a set transformer right here and we'll set the transform of the joints based on what the transform of the controls are doing. So I'm just going to clean this up a little bit here just so that we can see what's going on. So I'm just double clicking the curve here just to add a rewrote node. But basically, we're going to get the transforms of the finger controls and we're going to set the transforms of the finger bones to be those of the controls, essentially creating a forward kinematics solution, an FK solution. I'm going to compile. And this is all we need for now. So we're going to go back to our forward solve setup here and take a look at how we use this. So we're going to set this up after the heading. But essentially, all we need to do is drag our finger FK setup. There we go. And we now need to feed the information of the finger controls and the finger bones. So how do we do that? We're going to go to the rig hierarchy and we'll do it with the left side first. But we're going to grab all of the controls. We're going to drag them in. And instead of saying get control, because this will do one by one by one, we're going to do create item array. So essentially organize everything into one big node. And you can see for each control, we have an index that gets assigned to it. OK, now the next thing I'm going to do is do exactly the same thing, but with the bones. So I'm going to grab the bones. So click shift, control shift, just select and everything. And we're going to drag these in and create item array. Now, here's one thing that will be important. And that is that the indexes have to match because this is going to do it one to one. So for index zero, it will assign it to index zero. So just make sure that index 01 control matches index zero. Essentially, the control matches the bone. So just check that all these actually match. And they will because we've all we've we select them in the same order. But just quickly maybe go towards the bottom, see if everything's gone out whack. And if this is offset, you can either reassign it yourself or you can just reselect everything in the same order you selected the controls. So that will be important. So then all we have to do is assign these are the controls here. So we'll assign the finger controls there and we'll assign the finger joints here. And now all that's left to do is just connect that finger FK setup. So this will work for our left side. And we can just quickly check that this works. So if I just grab one of these controls here, you can see I can rotate it and it will rotate. The bone for me, which is exactly what I want. You can see now we have controls for the fingers. Awesome. I'm just going to quickly compile this. It goes back to the original setup and I'm just going to I essentially I don't love crossing wires like this. So usually I use a re root node, but I do like to set these up side by side. Specifically, so I can just quickly, easily check each index matches its respective bone to control. So we're going to do the same now with the right side. So we're going to grab all of these and create an array. So that's the controls. And we'll do the same now with the bones. So remember, we're just doing it in exactly the same order. So we selected them. Create an array. Once again, I'm just going to match these up together and go get pinky one ring one, two, three. That looks good. Indexes and then thumbs right at the end. OK, awesome. These all look good. And really, all I need to do now is just drag my finger FK setup again. You know, and you can choose to organize this as you wish, but I tend to like to. So the bones are right there. And the controls are right there. Now, once I compile, you'll see the right side has exactly the same functionality. It's important to note that the controls essentially work hierarchically because we set them up that way. Right. So we set up. Remember, we set up the controls to be in a hierarchy correctly. So just remember that they're not just loose controls. And there you have it. So we've created a function that handles all our FK setup automatically. So all I'll do now is I'm just going to grab this. Finger FK right side. If I actually type it finger FK right side. And I tend to like to add the color that the controls have as well. And then comment this as well. And this will be. Finger FK left side. And I like to make this one blue. Once again, just to match the sort of colors that we have in the actual editor as well. So we have it. We have made a function. And we've created a function that handles all of the controls. And that's what we have in the actual editor as well. So we have it. We have made a function. Let's quickly take a look at it again. So the function has two input nodes that we're able to feed later down the line. And what the function does is it gets the transforms of the controls and sets the transforms of the bones based on the transforms of the controls. And that's really it. Thank you.",
