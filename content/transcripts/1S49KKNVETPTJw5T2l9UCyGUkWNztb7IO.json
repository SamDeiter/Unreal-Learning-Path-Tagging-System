  "text": " Before we hop into the engine, we want to go over some animation and skeletal mesh editors. So what are all these icons that you're going to see? Well, as described, the Skeleton, Mesh, Animations, Animation Blueprints, and Physics are all sub-editors that we'll be able to access and will show us various things that we need to see. Starting with the Mesh Editor, this is one of the editors that will allow you to see your materials, level of details, and morph targets. You'll also see the Skeleton Editor, which is the other sub-editor, that will be able to add things like our workshop today, adding a socket, adding virtual bones, changing the preview mesh, as well as previewing some animations. You can create different asset types, like a static mesh from the pose, and you can even manage animation notifies. Now here are several of the different types of animation editors. This is just an overview. We will be looking at this a little bit more in the engine, but as you can see, each one has its own special place. One does for blend spaces, montages, and animation sequences. Another one is the Animation Editor. And then finally, you can see the way to bake some of these animations to a control rig. Here in the editor, if you remember the animation folder where we saw the animation sequences, we're going to access that again. I'm going to open up the A-Bot Walk animation sequence by double clicking on it. And you're going to see here the Animation Sequence Editor. These are all animations that have been pre-recorded and baked out from a sequencer type animation. So we wouldn't typically animate everything from this Animation Sequence Editor. Rather, we would use this to edit an animation sequence, as the name implies. There are a few things here in this timeline that you may not recognize, and so I want to introduce those to you. So you'll see this Notifies, Curves, and some Additive Layer Tracks. Well the additive layer track, you could say, for example, you could come here and select the arm, for example, and you could set a key so that, let's just say we want to key that right there as the opening position, and then just kind of scrub through here to the animation, and maybe rotate his arm more and hit the S as in Sam key again. And you'll notice you'll see this curve created. Let's just say we want to go all the way back down here to the end, and we want to bring it back down. Well you just kind of pull it right here and just kind of, you know, reanimate where you wish to place this. And just hit S again. Now if you go back to the beginning and you press Play, you'll see his arm kind of moves and snaps. Now it snaps because it's returning back to zero. So in the looping it would do that if we were to use this animation later. Now you can record it and record a new animation or new animation sequence just merely by pressing this record key. And it'll ask you where you wish to save it. So you just hit OK. And when you're happy with it, you can just hit stop. As soon as you do that, you'll notice you have a new animation. I'm going to take it back to the beginning and you'll see here it does say new animation has been successfully recorded. So now you could use this and just name it to my new animation and be done with it. So here in the editor, if you remember the animation folder where we saw the animation sequences, we're going to access that again. I'm going to open up the A-Bot walk animation sequence by double clicking on it. And you're going to see here the animation sequence editor. These are all animations that have been pre-recorded and baked out from a sequencer type animation. So we wouldn't typically animate everything from this animation sequence editor.

I'll take it back to the beginning and you'll see here it does say new animation has been successfully recorded. So now you could use this and just name it to my new animation and be done with it. Now that I cleared the graph, let's take a look at notifications. Now what are they? They're a way of adding, let's say, some effects to this animation. So let's say, for example, we wanted to have an explosion when his right foot hits or plants. So we'll say it kind of goes like right about there. And I'm going to right click within this area, the notification. I'm going to add a notification. I'm going to do a play particle effect versus a Niagara. Now the reason is because you would have to set up a Niagara particle effect first. To keep things simple, we're going to use play particle effect. And you'll notice nothing happens. Well, the reason for that is we have to assign a particle. So by clicking on this and going to the details, you'll see we have all these wonderful little explosions and fire. So I'm going to do a P explosion. Now we'll take this back and see if it does indeed trigger and boom, we get a little fire. Let's say we wanted to do it on the left as it comes down. There's a couple of ways you could do this. You could actually hit play and simply copy and paste as this goes through. Or to be a little bit more precise, we'll just take this control C and then control V and it'll pop it right where the scrubber is at. So that's a nice little clue there is wherever the scrubber is at is where our effect will be. Boom. Now you may be wondering, can we go and do it in reverse? There isn't a way right now to do that in there in this for simplicity sake, but you can through some different timing. But for now, this is the simple way of doing it. Now let's say you're all done and you like this. Hey, I really like this. I want to record it. So what you could do again is you could go back here and do the same thing we did previously and then just hit play and do record and name it Firewalk or something along those lines. But this is just one of the many ways that you can edit the animation sequencers that are already made or created by adding more additive layer tracks through changing some positioning or even adding some explosions. So now that we've completed this animation sequence by adding an explosion and maybe some additive layers like moving a bone here and there to make the arm move, we could also take this even further and edit it even though we've recorded it. So we can come up here to edit in sequencer, simply click that button and you'll see edit with FK control rig or bake to control rig if there is an existing one there. But we could just simply click edit with FK control rig and it'll bring it up within sequencer. Thereby we can adjust each one of the keys and further animate our sequence and bake it out to be used later. But before we jump into sequencer, let's go ahead and work on our next project, which is adding a socket.",
