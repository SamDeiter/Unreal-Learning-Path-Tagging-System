  "text": " Now we're going to take a look at creating a new landscape, and we're going to do this by first creating a new basic level inside of our project. We're going to come up here and we're going to go to File, New Level, and then select the basic from the template and hit Create. This is going to give us a brand new basic level. Next, what we're going to do is we're going to activate our landscape mode by going up to the Selection tool and then selecting Landscape. We can also do this by pressing Shift and the number 2 key on our keyboard. Let's pop over to the editor and do that now. Now before I continue, I'm going to do one other thing and that is going to click this ground right here and press Delete. We don't need this, it's going to get in the way of our landscape, so we just want to get rid of that. Then we're going to come up here to our selection and click on landscape. Now with our landscape selected, the next thing that we're going to do is we are going to adjust both the location and the section size. For our location, we're going to take it and set it to 0, 0, 0, and the X, Y, and Z axis. This is not needed in order for the landscape to function, but more of a personal preference as I like to think of the landscape at 0, 0, 0 being sea level, and then anything that goes negative is below sea level, and anything that goes positive is above sea level. The last thing we're going to do is we're going to set the section size on this landscape to be 15 by 15 quads. The reason we're doing this is just to make this landscape a little smaller, it's easier to work with in this particular tutorial. You can make landscapes of any size that just requires more artistic direction in order to paint it. Again, since this is a small tutorial, we're just going to create a small landscape. Let's pop over to the editor and look at this now. Again, first thing, we are in our landscape mode. We are going to set the location to 0, 0, 0. There we go. Then we're going to set our section size to be 15 by 15. You can see that's just going to give us a slightly smaller landscape to work with. Once we have all of that done, we need to go ahead and press the Create button to create our landscape. Again, just to recap, we're not to file new level, we selected the basic level, we deleted this little box, and then we came here to our landscape. We set our section size to 15 by 15, we made sure our location is at 0, 0, 0, and then we hit the Create button to go ahead and create that landscape for us.",
