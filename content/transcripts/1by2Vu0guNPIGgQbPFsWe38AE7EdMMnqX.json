  "text": " In this video, we're going to talk about how to set up two-way communication so the receiver can also send message back to the sender. Now, to do that, let's take a look at what it is being set up right now. In the sender, you will see the two-way communication related parts are all being commented in the yellow command box. So first, at begin play, we will check if this instance should be in two-way communication. If it is two-way, for the sender, remember that before that, the sender only has a OSC client targeting the receiver, so the sender doesn't have any way to receive messages. So to allow the sender to also able to receive messages, we want the sender to create an OSC server. Now, because I know that my internet is fairly simple, I'm going to just leave this part blank, so it will try to grab the first IP it has on this device. And remember to use the same port that is going to send the message back in. Right now, we just use the OSC port variable, which we can set in the launch parameter later. And now I set the name of the OSC server to also be server. And if you remember, on the receiver side, we also have the same server name here. It's a bad practice, so we actually should try to name them something else. But if you remember, a sender is never a receiver. So there's another chance. So usually there will not be the same named OSC server component at the same instance. So that is actually fine. But still, if we want to make sure the server name is never the same, we can also use like sender IP address, for example, to be the name. So unless there's like same instance from the same IP, the name will never be duplicated. So now we gave the sender's own server as a different variable. And we want the server to kind of react to all the events in the same way the receiver receives it. So now we want to bind it to the OSC Boundary received and also bind it to OSC Message received. So when that happened, we actually wanted to just do the same thing as what the receiver is doing. So remember, at BeginPlay, we are getting the receiver on the same level as a reference. We're now going to get that reference and just fire the same event in OSC receiver. That's it. Now we made sure the sender also has a server is able to listening to coming OSC messages. And whenever there is a message or a bundle coming, it is doing the same reaction we wanted to do on the receiver side. Now let's go to a receiver side and move on to the two way part. So at BeginPlay, it is checking if it is a two way communication. If it is, it wants to also be able to point to the sender and send message back to the sender. So for that, we want to create an OSC client. The OSC client will have to target to the sender IP address where we can set inside launch parameter. And the same we're going to use the OSC port here. We're going to save the client as a OSC client. And on the sender side, we want to the client. And we also want to save it as a variable on the OSC sender blueprint. Now, in order to send the messages, just so that we don't need to duplicate all the events again, we will go back to our sender part. And now if we go to the send event, send messages event here, we will see that when we're sending the message, we are selecting our target based on if the instance being played is a sender. So now if I am a sender, I know the OSC client I want to target is the first one, because this is the first one I saved before I do the two way communication thing. This is the receiver's target. But if the instance being played is not a sender, it is a receiver, then we know receiver want to use this target. It's targeting the sender. Now this might feel a little bit complicated, but just know that we are just reusing the same set of logic. And based on who is sending, we will target different target destinations here. So we can so we know that this part is already taken care of for the example events here, and we just want to grab this logic, we will copy and put into the new two events we just created. So we know that OSC client and OSC client here. So we know that the send event here is working for one way communication. To make it working on two way communication, I will replace the target to be this one. And same thing for the bondo. I'm just going to drag down here. Delete this node. Like so. Okay, so now we're ready to run the two way testing. I'll just before we make a package, I'll just connect back to where it should be. So make sure we are using the launch parameter. Like so. Save it. Okay, so now we already finished working on the two way communication. Now let's move on to package this project.",
