  "text": " As promised, the first thing we'll touch upon is coming to Unreal Engine from other engines. So if you are familiar with maybe Unity or Godot or some other kind of licensed engine that you might have been using, some of the terminology may be similar, may be different, and today's class is hopefully just going to help onboard you a little bit better into Unreal Engine so it's not as overwhelming for you. So some of the terminology will be different, maybe game objects, actors and scene components in the different engines might be different. But if you look at the middle row here, components, components and nodes, these are all kind of similarities that might be shared across the engines. So if you're thinking in terms of something was called named something in one engine and it might be slightly different in the other engine, we can look at these like prefabs in Unity might be blueprint classes inside of Unreal. So hopefully the terminology doesn't get too confusing. If you are imprinted with terminology and names from other engines, we've listed two really good resources here that will really help you get your head around using Unreal Engine and the terminology associated with it. So if you go to the Epic Developer Community forums, we've got something called Unreal for Unity developers, which is a really good getting started in UE5 course if you're familiar with Unity. And then there's also a really great resource on YouTube, which Alex Forsyth has developed, which talks about actors and components and inheritance and composition across the various engines. So if you are familiar with the software, I definitely recommend touching these two resources as well as today's course to help give you a more rounded overview. Now, starting with the concept of actors inside of Unreal Engine, you'll hear the word actor a lot in this image. You can see a lot of different things happening. It may feel overwhelming, but in the very top right of the image that you'll see here, it says parent class actor. And you'll notice that everything in Unreal Engine is an actor to an extent, which is a scriptable entity in and of themselves. So they can use coded logic. They may have inheritance, another class, but at the very highest level will have this actor class. And if you see the green box on the left hand side of the image here, you'll see all a list of components which can be actors within themselves. So you'll see a scene root, which then has a cube mesh, a little static mesh component attached to there, and then a point light. And you'll just see a list of these components here. So if I've selected the point light, which I have in this blueprint, you'll see, for example, on the right hand side where that red arrow is, it has some location values. So it's got a vector there associated with the location, X, Y, and Z. And you'll see that each actor and each component that I have selected has multiple editable properties. So an actor with scene components will have one component as their root, which then acts as the transform of the actor itself. So hopefully that's not too overwhelming of an image to share. It's kind of useful to get familiar with this terminology and how Unreal Engine sets up its behavior by default. But we'll get plenty into more detail of actors to help demystify some of these concepts that you might be experiencing.",
