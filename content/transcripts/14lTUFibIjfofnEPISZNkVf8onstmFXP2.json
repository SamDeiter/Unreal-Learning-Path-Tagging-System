  "text": " Now that we have our landscape created, let's take a look at how we can sculpt this landscape to give us a look and feel that we want instead of just a flat plane in the world. Now, before we jump into actually sculpting, let's talk a little bit about the tools. Now, on the screen in front of us, we have the various tools that we can utilize when sculpting our landscape. Each tool is going to have some settings that are unique for that tool, but also there are some global settings such as the strength of our brush as well as the brush size and brush fall off. For now, let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and we're going to click on the noise tool. Now, the noise tool is going to allow us to add noise in both the positive and the negative direction, and it's a great way to initially break up your landscape. I'm just going to zoom out here. Everybody that's following along want to spend a little bit of time trying to paint a little bit of noise in our landscape. Now, if we don't get the right setting here, we can always increase the brush strength. I'm probably going to bring up the brush size just a little bit. It's going to help break this up. Now, I'm going to come down here so that I can get a look at what the end user might see on this. Again, we're just going to be breaking this up, allowing it to look a little more natural, a little less man-made. Spend the next few minutes just adjusting the tool and the various settings here with the noise to go ahead and get a result that you're looking for. Now that we've added the noise tool, we should have something that looks like this. We have a little bit of noise and let's go ahead and just pop back over to the editor and see what we have here. That's what our noise is looking like. Next, what we're going to do is we're going to use the Sculpt tool in combination with one setting called Use the Clay Brush. This is going to help us raise up sections of our landscape and make it a little bit easier to make things like clips or sheer faces. Let's pop back over to the editor now. What we're going to do is we're going to come here to our Sculpt and we're going to make sure that we have this Use Clay Brush enabled. You can see here when I start to bring up, you can see it's bringing up the edges along with our noise. This is a really great way to do things like add a little bit of a sheer face to somewhere. If we don't have the Clay Brush on, you're going to see it bring things up in the shape of with a fall-off. That's not exactly the greatest when it comes to trying to build something like a mountain or hills or something like that. The Clay Brush does help us establish these really cool little bits of raised area that we can then go on to use to make mountains. I'm going to reset my brush strength here. What I want everybody to do is just for the next few minutes, just using this to generate some really cool and interesting raised areas for our landscape, which we can then come back to in a little bit. We'll refine these to help make everything look more realistic and look a little more natural. Now that we've added the sculpting tool to help raise things up, what we're going to do now is we're going to go in with the Smooth tool and smooth some things out to make the transition between some of our high, medium, and low areas a little less steep. This is going to do two things. One, it's going to help with some of the shadowing issues that we could currently be having. It's also going to make our landscape, when we apply a material to it, looks smoother in those areas. Let's pop back over to the editor here. Then we're going to come to our Smooth tool. There we go like this. Then what we're going to do is we're just going to smooth some stuff out. Now, the tool strength of 0.3 is probably a little bit too much. We're going to set this to 0.1 and press Enter. Then we're just going to start to smooth some of this stuff out. Remember, we don't want to go too overboard on our smooth. We want to just make sure that that grid pattern that we see on there isn't too distorted. Remember, the more distorted that grid pattern is, means the more distorted our texture will be in that particular area when we go to apply a material to this. We just want to spend the next few minutes just smoothing things out a little bit, giving us a little bit of a smoother area to work with, especially in between things like this where we had that very triangulated terrain right there. This is just going to help smooth that out, make those transitions a little bit better. Last but not least, we are now going to apply the erosion and the hydro erosion tools to our landscape to help give us the look that this landscape has been weathered by dirt, and wind, and time. Now, to do this, it's very simple. Let's pop back over to our editor. We're going to come here to our erosion tool. There we go. To use the erosion tool, we want to simply drag from the top down to the bottom. This is going to give us this cool erosion pattern because remember, erosion works by taking dirt and things like that, and through the force of gravity, it's going to come down the hill like so, and then it's going to come say rest down here at the bottom. As we are painting our erosion, it's best to start at the top and work our way down because remember, as things erode, it's going to be a combination of gravity and wind taking material from the top and then as it starts to move down that hill, it's going to deposit and or remove material. You can see here we're getting some really nice looking erosion style lines. Now, you might be tempted to do something like this. Maybe take your brush all the way up and click once on your terrain to make some erosion. I know that might work in some instances. It's going to end up actually destroying a lot of the finer detail that this tool can make. While that is possible, I highly suggest that you again, start from the top and drag your way down, again, mimicking the way that erosion works in the real world. Now, we also have hydro. Now, hydro is slightly different from erosion. Hydro is dealing specifically with water. Where water comes from a high location and it's going to drag sediment and things like that down. We want again to make sure our tool strength is set to 0.1 because making this any stronger is actually going to give us some really bad pits or very sharp spots, and we don't really want that. Again, we want to start from the top and drag down. We can also increase our brush strength again to give us a little bit more of the results that we're looking for. But again, remember, less is more with this particular tool. You can see here as I'm just going from the top and dragging down, I'm getting some really cool erosion style details. Now, with these tools, I want everybody to spend a little bit of time going through the sculpt, erase, erosion and hydro tools to help construct this landscape, giving you something that fits the need of the project you're currently working on. Everybody spend a little bit more time just messing around with the landscapes experimenting with the various tools, and we will see you in the next section.",
