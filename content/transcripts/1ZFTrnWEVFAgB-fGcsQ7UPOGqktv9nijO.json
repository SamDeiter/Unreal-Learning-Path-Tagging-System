  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at world scope and initial setup when it comes to working with virtual production. So let's get started. So one of the first things you want to take a look at is examining the workflow and how real time fits into play when it comes to virtual production. So scope, it's obvious when starting and constructing a virtual set, the scope needs to be examined and the overall amount of work needed. When Unreal comes into play, it can alleviate a lot of heavy lifting, keeping things in real time. And you can see the chart down below where Unreal can handle a lot of what you would have work wise when it comes to offline and working with virtual production. Unreal can do that. And the nice thing about it is we're working in real time and things will update on the fly. One main beginning step when collecting assets is what shots you have to ask yourself, what shots are needed, what assets will be needed to create the suspension of disbelief. This will take some time. So make sure you take the amount of time and know exactly where your hero objects are in the scene and how to focus on them. So those assets and blocking. This begins once the appropriate concept art is in place, visual reference, asset review will focus on determining which hero objects get focused on and what gets the highest resolution. Many assets will need to be edited and migrated. So whole packages are not used. This is also this also prevents any overload of unnecessary items. Sometimes it might be might be good to have similar assets available for any quick set changes in the project. So having those assets, if you have several different varieties of changes, just keep that in mind, because if you know your director and you know exactly what the vision is, you'll know exactly what you need to swap out when when necessary. Always creating a blocking testing to check for migration issues. That is very important. And test out effects or blueprints is a good practice. And I do this all the time. When I build my scenes, I'll have a testing initially to make sure one, my migrations working if I need to migrate to a more complicated type of item, or also to check to see if the tool is going to be needed or wanted or looks the way that I want it to initially. And then eventually I will migrate it to my final end result. So let's take a look at Megascans and how this works. So make sure all your tools are updated when it comes to Bridge. Bridge is very important that you update this because once you update it and it will give you a prompt, you'll know exactly what you can get your hands on, as well as making sure you get the latest assets from Quixel Megascans. You want to determine where you want to download and where that download is to go. That's very important because by default, Megascans or Bridge, I should say, will download to a particular folder based on what project you have open. So if I have a particular project open and I download Megascans, it'll go to that project's directory. You can change that in your Quixel settings, but I don't recommend it because if you do, you have to constantly change and update that folder file depending on what you have open so that Megascans can prioritize that folder location. And you can forget that you can be in the zone and forget to do that. So it's good to leave the default ready to go. So it goes directly into what ever is open. So just keep those things in mind if you're using it. Otherwise, you can use Quixel Bridge separately, download it and then bring it into Unreal later. But again, we have quick access here. So let me show you that in Unreal, where those things are located. All right, let's go ahead in Unreal and take a look at where to get these things active. So you'll see down below, we have a pull down quickly add to the project and you'll see Quixel Bridge is accessible. And again, you can run Quixel Bridge separately if you wish, but keep in mind for the latest and the greatest, it's pretty much going to be linked up to Unreal 5.3 or whatever version is active. So I'm going to go to Quixel Bridge here and click on this. Now, I'm already logged in, but you will get a prompt if you are not to update if you're not already updated. So just keep that in mind. It may also show up once you log in that you need to update. So also keep that in mind. I can pick any of these assets that I want. So say I'm going to pick maybe some juicy chicken. There's a chicken scan here and I can choose from here what my quality is going to be. Is it low quality for maybe mobile? Is it high quality for mobile? Is it medium quality for something in the distance, even low quality if in the distance and for virtual production, high quality or even Nanite? Maybe it's up close and we want to get the highest resolution. Those options are there. You'll notice right here we have a small little looks like several bars to choose from. It's almost like a little sliders icon. If I click on this, this is used for creating blended materials. Now for previous versions of Unreal, I should say Quixel Bridge outside of the one that's built into Unreal, this will be used for different options such as looking at your outputs. But in this case, it's a bit different. So here we can choose which one we want. We can look at ones that they suggest on top of it and we can choose even a Nanite biscuit. Oh, that looks delicious. So in here, we also want to take a look at some of our settings. You'll notice in here we have a bar up at the top, which allows us to be able to do searches and categorize things the way that we need. In our account, you'll notice we also have about bridge and also preferences. In our preferences, we can decide where our library path is going to go. Now you'll see it says default library Megascans. But since we have things already set up by default, we won't necessarily need to be able to change that. Like we can keep that as is, but you have the option to do so. I have mine working just fine. But if I run out of room, I can change that directory to go to a different drive. We also have the account here. So you can actually go into your account if you need to log in. That just gives you quickly into the system. So you can actually go into your account and log in. If you need to log in, that just gives you quickly into the space that you need when it comes to your specifics for your account. I'll click on, oh, click on the wrong one there. I'll go back into there and you'll see support. We also have full support and so forth for reporting issues, show your logs and so forth. So that helps you out. But if we go back into preferences here for a second, you'll notice it also has proxies and ports if you need to send things in those particular areas. And it says share usage data. There we go. And that's for privacy purposes if you need it. You'll notice we have local. This is going to be all the local things that we've already downloaded. And this will include 3D assets, 3D plants. These are some of the things that I've grabbed, surfaces, decals and even my metahumans. Look at such a handsome metahuman. I would hang out with him. So if we go in here, you also see favorites, things that I've favorited. Okay, ignore that. I did favorite my own metahuman. That's okay. Cause he's handsome and I can help myself. He's pretty cool. And you have also collections. Now remember, like I said, when you click on these items, you'll see a download icon here and a favorite icon. So if you've already downloaded it, let's go back into the ones that we have and say I've downloaded an asset already. You will actually see a blue icon. So let's go ahead to our local. What do we have here? And you'll see that blue icon, say export high quality. And this will go directly into my Unreal, my Unreal that is already open. Now again, outside of the defaults, if you're using Bridge separately, you'll be able to maintain and control some of this a bit better, but you all may not, you may not get the latest and greatest cause this is the latest build for Bridge. So you'll get these, some of the scan, you'll get most of the scans that you need and you should be able to in the older versions, but there may be some disconnect when it comes to which version of Unreal you can directly talk to. So what I mean by that is the one that's standalone is used for earlier versions, typically for Unreal. The one that's built into Unreal gives you the latest and greatest. So just keep that in mind if for some reason you find a disconnect. So let's go ahead and look at a few more things in Unreal. So in Unreal, once my item goes into our scene, we can now see, let's go and find this item exactly where it stands, polygon wise. So you can float over it and it will tell you exactly what the poly count is. This is super convenient. You can also convert it to an Nite object if you need to. And you'll see mine is already converted to an Nite object. So that's pretty handy. So when grabbing your assets, you want to make sure you choose your LODs wisely if you're not using Nite. Now there's a difference between them. Nite is going to have its own type of LOD type of system in it built in so that it puts the polygons and the geometry in a cache so that it only calls upon it when needed. In LODs, it only calls upon the level of detail based on the distance of your camera. And that's built in within the LODs. Let's go and take a look at that up close in Unreal. And this will be a review for some of you that have taken some of the other classes concerning. So let's pick on this little rock for a second. He's currently in Nite. So if I go and find him in here and I right click in here, you'll see that Nite is active. But if I was to turn Nite off for a moment, give it a second here as it's thinking. So it might take some time for that to go through, especially if the asset that you've converted away from Nite is populated in other things. And here I have a PCG in the background and there's a few of them probably floating around in there. So it may take a little bit of time. So just be patient. Let's go and double click now on this asset and take a look at LODs up close. So let's go ahead and double click on this asset and take a look at LODs up close. And if I go and find him in here and I right click in here, and take a look at LODs up close. So right now you'll see that we are in here no longer in a Nite mode. Now you can also tell if you accidentally open up an asset and maybe forgot to check in the browser, if you just simply type in Nite, you'll see a Nite enable support is not active. So it's not going to be rendering as a Nite object. Currently this is using LOD system. Now you can use the LOD system. Now it's always better to use Lumen. If you're using Lumen, it's always better to use Lumen with Nite. If you are not, you can now choose or have the LOD do auto load, or you can choose how many versions of LOD you want. You'll see that there is also a custom button here. If I click on the custom button, I can now isolate what LODs I want. I can even increase how many LODs that I want in place. So you'll see a minimum. You'll see the LOD settings here. You'll see LOD grouping if you want to be able to categorize it. Now be careful when doing this, because every once in a while, when you change the grouping, you may get a polygon shooting out of nowhere and you'll just have to eliminate the group or the polygon set that's giving you trouble or LOD that may be giving you trouble. You'll see a number of LODs so I can minimize this if I need to. And it says auto compute LOD distances. I can turn this off and when you do, you'll see gray areas now become active when it comes to screen size. So all of this is at your fingertips. And you can see also you can there's reduction settings for each one. All this is beneficial to be able to control what your LOD is going to do. In the case of virtual production, you may just want an LOD zero. Or if the object is far away, you may isolate, turn all these off and may just want an LOD four, an LOD three, or maybe an LOD two, depending if things are really far away, getting a bit closer and maybe a medium distance. This is all up to you how this works. And you'll see Unreal process this information as we move closer and farther from the object. And you can control those distances as we talked about before. You see here me reiterating those exact same functions and abilities to be able to give you full control. Well, that's it with this one. You can see credits here. I want to give a shout out to Brandon Jones and King Chen for graciously giving some early concept art in the very first beginning slides. Here is a link for Quixel Megascans for a quick breakdown of what material does what to make it beneficial for you. In the next lesson, we're going to take a look at basic lighting concepts.",
