  "text": " And to close out, let's talk about some of the optimization tools that you can use in your projects. So the console is a really useful thing to use in your projects. You can toggle a whole bunch of render quality settings and just pre-visualize some information that you might need to do. So that can be opened by pressing the tilde key on your keyboard, which is usually the top left button on your keyboard next to the number one key. You can open that console and type a bunch of commands in there to get the desired outcome. You can type help to open up all the different help. It'd be too much to go over in this one course, but whether you want rendering, when you want to export the rendering information to the screen or whether you want to see how many sound files are being played at this time, what is affecting tick or what's affecting the shadow maps or anything like this. You can see a whole bunch of information here. You can really get granular with the console variables. So if you want to find them all, just type in help and you'll get familiar with the go-to ones that you use on a general basis here. Scale also comes with some scalability settings. So dependent on, again, the project and the platform. Here are some affordances you can make, whether you want everything to always be set to epic or cinematic or whether you want it to automatically try and scale based on the platform. Maybe you want to set certain things to medium, but you really want foliage and shading to be the best quality it can be. So you can set them to epic, for example. So a lot of fine grain information on how to scale your settings here. You can also monitor the Reddit editor performance, which the editor can say, this is how your computer is running. Do you want to change the settings? So useful things to keep in mind here. And then also here's some different views of what it might look like if you go from low to medium to high and then to epic. So we also have a Nanite auditing tool. And the Nanite auditing tool can tell you what kind of mesh errors you're getting with the static meshes. It can tell you the triangle count. So it might even be useful if you've imported this mesh that's just got a crazy amount of triangles and you're thinking, oh, I didn't realize that. And it's a nice list of previewing the information that's in your tool, in your scene. Anyway, so it tells you how many instances there are of a certain mesh. So maybe you've got a really heavy mesh that you thought was being instanced more than it wasn't. And maybe you can make some affordance there again to kind of replace it with a mesh that's less expensive, for example. And then it'll tell you the errors as well. So you can perform the audit there on the top left, on the top right hand side, sorry, as well. You can just refresh the scene. So definitely worth checking out the Nanite auditing tool there. And then we can also bulk edit assets. This is a really useful thing. If you have gone through some of those, say, texture optimizations before and you think, okay, my textures weren't optimized before, but now I want to go and edit all the textures to have this certain property. Now you could double click on each texture and change it per instance, but that can be very time consuming, especially if you've got a lot of content in the project. This can work on static meshes. It can work on sound files. It can work on everything. But essentially, you can shift select multiple textures. In this example, again, it can be any asset type. And then you can right click on the actual selected textures and you can go to asset actions and you can bulk edit via property matrix. And this will give you any common settings shared across the new assets that you've selected in your content browser. So if they're all of the same asset type, then it's going to give you a lot more options rather than if you selected a static mesh, a sound cue and a texture, for example. So there's a very, very powerful tool for editing lots of content all at once. And then also you can pin certain settings, which is quite useful to do, especially if you're constantly using certain variables. So in this instance, because we've used textures, the different compression settings, are all these normal maps set to be compressed as normal maps, for example? And so you can see at a holistic level what your content is doing. Do you need to edit anything, especially when we're looking at the texture compression settings, for example, do you want to go and check that all your normal maps in this instance are all set to the correct compression? So very useful for getting just an overview of everything that's going on in your content browser. And you can also package level instances as well. So if you've got, say, these four different meshes that you've placed together and you want to say, OK, I just want a singular instance of these, you can actually create from the selection in the level instance tab and package level instance blueprint and hit OK. And that will make some affordances for these four meshes that have been placed together and Unreal will then make an optimization based on that. You can also merge actors together. So on our left hand side here, you can see all these static meshes have been placed perfectly in the scene and the 61 different meshes used here with 19 different materials and 51,000 triangles. And so maybe we weren't hitting performance for some reason, maybe there was just too many draw calls for these static meshes. Now what we can actually do is we can right click and we can merge the actors. And when we merge them, we can actually make it just one draw call, one static mesh, and it actually has one material and it still preserve the number of triangles. So if you still want to preserve that visual bar in terms of texture detail, at least in terms of triangle detail, sorry, then you can merge these actors. So again, you can just right click and select your actors and merge those actors together. And if you see the merge actors property here, so when you are right clicking the merge actors, you can see that what you're doing here is checking the merge method. So do you want to merge it to a single mesh actor? And you can change this setting and it'll tell you the components that are being merged And a useful tick box to know about on the bottom left hand side of that merge actors is that replace source actors. So depends if you're trying to preserve the scene or not. So say you do replace source actors from that previous example we saw, it's going to replace all those 61 static meshes with one static mesh. But maybe that's not ideal for your scene. Maybe you actually want to preserve all of those individual meshes, but you want to create a new version and place a new version somewhere else. So you may want to tick or untick that box. And again, you can just find the different settings that you want to use. The merge actors tool is very powerful tool. And again, if you're trying to bring down those draw calls, it might be worth checking out.",
