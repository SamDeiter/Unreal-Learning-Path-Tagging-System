  "text": " Let's briefly talk about Unreal Engine as it applies to game development. Unreal Engine has always fundamentally been a game engine. It allows you to create content, let players move around and interact with it, and ultimately allow this dynamic exchange between what the player wants to do and an experience that you create for them. There are many benefits to using Unreal Engine for game development, but as it pertains to Sequencer, the most important thing to remember is that we are building this world for the players to interact with and then occasionally stepping in to present them with a visual experience or a montage of images, sound, etc. And we do that predominantly through Sequencer. One of the important things that we want to discuss as we go throughout this course is the concept of how games are made, released and content patched into it. So throughout this process of building our Sequence, you'll find that we will do certain practices to keep good organization and structure. Keep in mind that typically during a video game, you're going to have several cinematic experiences, meaning you want to have a very strong, flexible, and adaptable pipeline and process for building your Sequences and running them or executing them in the final game.",
