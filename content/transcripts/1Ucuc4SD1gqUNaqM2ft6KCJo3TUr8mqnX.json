  "text": " So we just finished up working with the multi-blend. We are now going to move into some other useful blending nodes. So the blend poses by nodes. Think of it as a switch or something to flip-flop based on some sort of input value. If the active changes, then the blend or change which input we're looking at will trigger what we're trying to do. So we're going to create a simple animation blueprint using the walk-in-place and fall-loop animation sequences. And all based on is the falling variable is true. We'll determine what blend occurs. Now the two nodes that we're showing here, the blend poses by integer and the blend poses by bold. A little differently than the other blends that we've used up to this point. So we're not blending based off of 50% of this or 10% of this. What we're doing is these will blend over the amount of time. And in the case of the Boolean, we're going to use the active value to trigger the false pose or the true pose and react via a certain animation that will be triggered. So let's go ahead and take a look at that. We're going to go ahead and disconnect the existing nodes as a state. So let's go ahead and hop into Unreal. And it should look a little something like this. And then we are going to create our blend poses by Boolean. So you can do blend poses by Boolean. And there it is at the bottom and select that right there rather than middle, not necessarily the bottom. I'm going to go ahead and connect this in here. And then the next thing we want to do is we want to bring the mm walk-in-place into place here and move these out. And we're also going to want to bring in the mm fall loop. So we got that here. We're going to let the fall loop be the true when is falling is going to be activated. And then if not, we'll have the walk-in-place. So think of a true false is what the trigger or the flip is going to be. Now, in order to get to the other part that we need, we need to make sure we're in a my blueprint area here. And then we're going to look for a variable in the essential movement data. You'll see here this Boolean that says is falling. And pull that right in. Get is falling is our only option, but that's the one we're using. And pull this in, click this in here, and we're going to hit compile and save. Now, right now, you're not going to see anything happen, right, because it's based off of a condition. So we're going to simulate this or go ahead and play in level. We should have this going right here. And if you remember, you can move your arrows. Okay, right now. And then I'm going to go jump, jump. And that is essentially the is falling that is giving us that trigger. So in our animations, we have to make sure we understand that every little bit of an animation is important, especially when you're triggering something. So utilizing the blend poses by Boolean, you can see we've told it that, hey, if it's falling, we get that animation. If not, it's just walking in place. Now, here in our slides, you will notice that we have the ability to change the preview mode. Now, that to work. Let's go ahead and look back into our under here. Everything is all set up. And you'll notice this has been selected. Now, if I go ahead and change this back in us, we lost it. So I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure we come up here that is a new window because we can alt tab in it. If you do simulate or the selective viewport, you won't be able to alt tab in and out. And we want to be able to do that so we can see how it's simulating here in our preview window, as well as everything is activated here within our editor. So now that we have the selected as a new editor window, but hit play. And this may pop up on another screen if you have it. Go ahead and just kind of put it a little off so you can see this in action. And you'll notice this becomes available now and select that. And you'll notice how the action is happening. I'm going to alt tab to bring that little window back up. And then I'm going to click inside it. So now I'm there. If you try to move your mouse to get over to this other screen, it's not going to work. So what we want to do first is we want to kind of just see what's going on. I hit my space bar and it is jumping. But you'll notice it's also jumping over here. And I'm going to hit alt tab. It was also jumping in this window and you were seeing the action triggering based off from the is falling. So that's what we wanted to see. All right. So the next part we want to kind of go over is the integer. The blend poses by integer. We aren't going to actually build anything on this, but I did want to mention as it is important. This allows us to think of it as a state switching amongst multiples. Now being an integer, that means we have more than one. So you can continually add more blend pins to activate multiple types of blends you wish to blend. And the nice thing about these green here, the blend times, is that that can be activated in real time. OK, so if you were in game, you could say, hmm, let's say, for example, if we're a certain health bracket and we want to cut off everything that's not healthy, we could do this based off from the input in live. So you can have multiples. The trick of that, of course, the caveat is that there's no naming. So you wouldn't know is this health, is this stunned or what. So that's where the next node is going to come in very handy. And that is going to be our blend poses by insert name here. Now that we worked with the blend poses by integer node, we were able to see how we can trigger multiple types of animations to blend based off from a status or give us a status. So, for example, as we said, we can have an injured or not injured or I'm totally healthy as it says, let's go. But we didn't have a way of really controlling that as far as seeing what was being activated. So this is where the enumerator comes in handy. Now, typically as a job of an animator, this isn't going to be your job. You would work with a technical artist more than likely that would create some of these nubs. But I want to show you the way that we will generate that. So, again, this would be like how I'm injured or work this way. I'm not injured, but feeling good. So, hey, let's do this and I'm totally healthy. Let's go. Let's go kill some bad guys. So we are going to build our own enumerator logic. So how we do that is, is we have to create an enumeration under the blueprints and then we'll double click on that and click add enumerator. We'll do this three times in order to create these different states. So let's go ahead and hop into the engine. Back in the engine, we'll now create our enumeration. Now, if you recall, the slide said to go to your blueprints and go to enumeration. You click on that, we can name it whatever we want. So in this case, let's just call it maybe say e status effect. That's just going to be like some form of status and the effect. Name it whatever you want. Just make sure you remember it so you can look at it because we're going to pull that in. Now go ahead and double click. Yours may open up another window so you can just dock it in here. And you will notice right now there are no enumerations. So we have to create those. Now we're going to do it three times. So go ahead and click this little plus three times. Here's the power. We're going to be able to name what we want. So what do we want? Let's just say stunned. We'll do this next one as let's say injured. And then the final one we'll do is blinded. So hopefully you kind of see where we're going with this. Go ahead and hit save. We're going to done with that. So you can go ahead and close that window. Now we can look for this in our animation blueprint to use. So how does it work? First thing we need to do is we need to look for a blend poses. And you'll see there are quite a few blend poses, right? So that's why it's important to remember what you named yours. So we want the e status effect. So you could e status and there it is right there. So what we've done essentially is we've created our very own node that can be used throughout your animation blueprints. So this is available to anybody that uses these projects. So now we could connect this all up and see what's going on. But the idea is to see what we did. So we remember we created our own names, but they're not here right now. So we have to assign it. So remember if it's not listed as add you can right click if the node has the availability. Look here. We now have our own pins and they're actually named what the action we want. So we hit stunned. Injured again, just right clicking and adding our pins and you'll notice we'll get the default pulse. We'll also get a stun pose a injured pose and a blinded pose. But we also get the blended time on which we wish to change it to based on one of these input animations. So this is a very powerful node that gives you the availability as a programmer essentially to create what we want to do. All right. So we are finished with this now. We're going to hop back in to create the final parts of our zombie animation.",
