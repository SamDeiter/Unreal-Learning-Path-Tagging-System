  "text": " All right, so let's talk about ways to manage your data inside Unreal Engine. So when we're talking about migrating into an Unreal Engine real-time production pipeline, you're probably going to be asking yourself some important questions. And they start with what is immediately important to learn between a DCC such as Maya and Unreal Engine? And what are the rules of working in real-time for a specific pillar? And what advantages am I going to gain by using Unreal Engine to create things for linear content in a virtual production real-time environment? So the next set of questions that pops up as you start to work in the Engine is that you're going to need to solve some specific problems. So those first problems are how do I get my data into Unreal Engine? What is similar to my current process with a DCC production pipeline? And most importantly, how do I make it look good? Then how do I achieve real-time? Like what does that even mean? And what's a good animation pipeline? So I think the main takeaway here is that there's plenty of documentation that's going to be available if you get stuck. And as you get started, it's just like learning any new software. Sometimes you're going to start out using just 5% to 10% of the features that you are familiar with. And as new areas start to open up, you're going to find better and newer ways of doing things. And essentially, this is just about loading up Unreal Engine, jumping in, and then figuring out that you have access to all the same tools that you've had and that everyone else has. And you can just start pulling at the different threads that you need to find interesting and new ways to start creating your virtual production tools and assets for this real-time workspace. So when we talk about migrating from Maya to Unreal Engine, one of the other things that pops up is that a lot of studios think adopting Unreal Engine is going to require a complete reset on their pipeline. And that might be true depending on what they want to accomplish, but the reality is that the two programs are intended to work together. They're actually designed to serve two different purposes. And Maya is what we commonly call a DCC package. So if you've already heard me refer to this, that means a digital content creation package. And it's intended to produce content that is passed to other departments to ultimately produce a final product. It operates as a single unified scene where only one set of data can be worked on at a time. And for a traditional pipeline, that's fine. Because everything is done separately and then published forward for the next department to use. Unreal, on the other hand, is a game engine. It's a sort of data aggregator that acts as its own production hub to create games and visuals, but it works in real time. And in order to achieve a real time performance, artists need to start thinking in terms of optimization. And sometimes computational sacrifices based upon the power of the CPU and GPU are going to need to be made. Whereas in Maya, visual effects artists are pretty much used to throwing more and more resources at the problem in order to achieve a rendered frame. That's why you get massive render farms and long render times. Unlike Unreal Engine, where you've built out an optimized asset, built that into your level and your sequence and your frames and renders are going to use real time technology to come out faster and better optimized. So now I want to talk about some of the similarities in terminology that you're going to run into between Maya and Unreal Engine. And as far as the generalities are concerned here, things are pretty much the same. There's a lot of consistency between the two programs and items are logically named and your experience in Maya is pretty easily transferable to working in Unreal Engine. The only difference is that once you learn the user interface, you're going to have no trouble at all understanding the basics of working in Unreal Engine. However, there are some things that are different that you need to consider and you'll probably have to make an adjustment to. Some of those are obvious, just like you see here. In Maya, we refer to a scene that contains and is saved as your .ma or .mb project file. That's where your asset lives. It's also where your assets can be aggregated into a scene or a set and that gets saved as its own or draws on others. But all those assets need to be finished or have a proxy that can be replaced later. Unreal Engine, on the other hand, uses a project file and inside that, every scene asset that's been built gets converted into a U asset and stored in the project file for use inside Unreal Engine. Everything becomes a U asset and all those U assets work together so that your entire project is all one optimized level. The Attribute Editor and Channel Box are two separate entities inside Maya, whereas the Detail Editor kind of combines those two together. Attributes that you have for asset location, rotation, and scale are all controlled in the Details Editor as well as some of the functionality and connections inside what you would find in the Channel Box. The World Outliner in Unreal Engine is just like the Outliner in Maya. It's what's inside your scene. That's how you find things pretty easily. But you can also navigate to where that file is stored from the Outliner into the Content Browser. The Visor or Content Browser is kind of similar to Maya, but I think Unreal Engine's is a little bit easier to work with and it's always there. Now you can shelve it if you'd like, but it's always going to be accessible and you can easily navigate to any asset through your World Outliner. Sequencer is a little bit more functional than the Tracks Editor. And the same can be said for the Material Editor as well. The Material Editor is very similar to the Hypershade. Now as you start to work in Unreal, there is some additional terminology that you're going to run into. The new terminology, these unique terms and actor classes that you're going to run into for the Engine terminology start out as things like the Static and Skeletal Meshes. Static Meshes are props and set pieces that are generally non-deforming. And Skeletal Meshes, on the other hand, are deforming Meshes. Characters, Assets, anything that has a joint system attached to it that can deform or move, that's a Skeletal Mesh. And we refer to both of these as Actors. Now Actors that can be possessed are Pawns. And both of these things can be referred to as Characters. Now when we talk about Levels and Maps, these two are interchangeable. They are larger parts of the World. They are all the same thing. The World contains the Map and the Map itself is the Level, but the Levels can also contain Sub-Levels so you can break everything down a little bit further. And when we start doing our animation and building our assemblies, this is where we talk about Level Sequences. Level Sequences also serve as a container for Control Rig to be used to animate Skeletal Meshes. So you can generate and create animation inside Unreal Engine for Skeletal Mesh Actors and Characters using Level Sequences to house that animation as part of your Scene Assembly. You can also then beautify things using Volumes and you can execute or adjust things using the visual scripting language that we've built called Blueprints. Additionally, everything is kind of handled easily through Source Control. So everybody can work in a collaborative environment in real time. Different departments can work on things concurrently, checking out Assets, checking out Level Sequences, checking out Levels in order to make sure that everything works together, gets assembled in a much faster real time collaborative environment. Now let's talk a little bit about project hierarchy. On the surface, both Maya and Unreal have a predefined directory structure to help organize your data. Maya Scene, Asset, and Source Image folders are pretty much the most well known. And for Unreal, life revolves around the Content folder. The biggest difference between these two on this level is that Maya directly accesses the source files for primary use, whereas Unreal Engine reads the original source file and converts it into a UAsset and then stores that UAsset in the Content directory. The source files are still important so don't get rid of them. However, they are secondary to working in Unreal Engine. Now let's jump into the Engine and take a look at both Maya and Unreal Engine for a second. I'm going to give you a quick tour around town and we're going to look and hunt down some Assets and see where the data is located and stored in ways that you are probably a little bit familiar. So starting first in Maya. So as we mentioned, I have a generator asset that was built by Sean Spitzer. And this generator asset in the Outliner looks like it's all one piece. However, we've kept it broken down into its separate modules so it's grouped underneath the main generator asset. So the generator model here is all of these little modules and these little model pieces combined into one. Now I could have combined this into a single asset. However, I wanted to keep them separate and we want to keep them separate for importing into Unreal Engine. Now if I look over here into the generator on the Channel Box, I can see how my Attribute Editor is going to allow me to make changes in the Channel Box for position, rotation, and scale. And my Attribute Editor is going to allow me to adjust tessellation, components, controls, tangent space, any of the objects you're already familiar with. And as we look in the viewport, we have the ability to move things around by using the W, E, and R for translation, rotation, and scale. And then I can also keyframe animation here on the timeline at the bottom if I need to. I have different tools for modeling and adjusting my assets and I can make other adjustments as well. However, the Project Hierarchy is going to keep this as a single asset. Unless I bring in and reference other assets and start creating layouts from here and this file can get a little bit unwieldy if there's too many assets inside of it. So let's jump into Unreal Engine and take a look at how that is put together. So I have my asset with my generator. If you can see in my Content Browser, I have folders for organization. My Content Browser is directly referencing that content folder and it matches one-to-one what is inside that content folder. I have my assets and inside my assets I have my generator which contains all the components, the textures, and the materials for my asset. Now I could organize this a little bit better so that my materials and my static mesh assets are organized better along with my texture assets and my FBX. But if I'm looking for the FBX asset, all I need to do to locate that is to move up into my Outliner, select the asset, and right-click on it. From there I can browse the asset and that's going to bring up the actual asset where it's located. If I open up this Blueprint class, I can see that I have some Blueprint information, I have all of my components, and my construction script, and the viewport for my asset to live. So you can see how all that's connected. I also have in here a details panel and that details panel tells me that I've got a static mesh. And that static mesh is my generator asset. That asset itself also contains materials. And that will allow me to select the material itself and see how my material is organized in the material graph. In the material graph I have a hierarchy to control how everything is assembled. So I have a base color, I have metallics, and I have in here some roughness. I also have a normal map for displacement and a way to control my textures for that. Now if I look into any one of these textures, you can see that I've got a texture connected to that as well as a base. If I double-click on that, I also have a texture editor. I can modify this if I want directly, or I can go back and re-import a texture that has been built from another DCC package. Now all of these allow me to see and access the asset inside Unreal Engine. And another aspect of this is that if I move up to this top bar, I have the ability to also play in the third-person mode. And my third-person mode allows me to move around by using controls to view what's going on inside my level. So I can actually see how it scales and I can see whether or not I need to make adjustments. Which believe it or not, I probably don't need to do because these control consoles are actually scaled to match whatever this character scale size is. So this asset, along with others, including my characters, is something I can access and then verify by testing out the scene. I can also create and record footage of this performance for this particular actor by controlling the actual movement. So walk cycles, run cycles, anything that I need to move through a scene, I can control as a character and record that performance, saving myself a ton of time. Now as I move back through here, I also want to point out that any of the details for any asset are selectable and viewable in my details panel. Any asset that does exist in here can also be viewed and controlled as well. And I can also take and locate an asset inside a different location by showing it in either the folder view or in the explorer. If I right-click and I show this inside explorer, it's going to bring up a menu and that's going to show me where it's located inside my asset folder. So let's go ahead and hide Unreal Engine and Maya. And let's also hide our slides for a second as we explore some of the project hierarchy as well. Now as I showed inside the explorer for my assets, I also want to point out that that lives here inside my Unreal Engine project folder. So I want to compare what these look like together. Maya has all of the assets inside this single folder where I have my scenes, my script, my workspace, and my actual scene file. Inside Unreal Engine, I only need to worry about my content and my config folder. I also can maintain my source folder and I need to make sure that I have my project file. All of these four assets are the only ones you need to maintain. The drive data cache, intermediate, and save folders can be tossed if you need to share this with another project, another studio, or another worker inside your team. Now as we look at the project hierarchy one last time, your content hierarchy on the disk is reflected inside the content browser in Unreal Engine through the use of UAssets. Whereas your source files are in a separate disk hierarchy for non-Unreal related files such as your FBX, ABC, Maya, or other files that you're going to reference later. Okay that's it for this section. Now in our next section we'll explore the Unreal Engine real-time pipeline with a focus on collaboration.",
