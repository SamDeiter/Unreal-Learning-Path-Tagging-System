  "text": " Okay, let's begin with what might be a review if you've already completed the Quickstart Sequencer Shot Creation course. We'll begin by exploring Sequencer fundamentals, starting with Sequencer's core concepts. And that begins with\u2026 What is Sequencer? Well, Sequencer is Unreal Engine's non-linear editor and assembly tool that is primarily used for ground-up shot creation, which can then be utilized for pre-visualization, full end-to-end film creation, and game cinematic event creation, all of which is done by using actors from the Outliner or assets from the Content Browser, adding them directly to Sequencer to create level sequence assemblies. You just heard me say level sequence assemblies, so you must be wondering\u2026 What is a level sequence? Well, level sequences are cinematic sequence containers used to create animated footage of actors within their scenes or shots that can be shuffled, trimmed, or time-stretched and rendered. The rendered footage can also be supplied to offline editors and, if desired, EDL and XML files can keep the two systems in sync with one another. Now level sequences can also be deeply nested within each other. If we look in the Content Browser under Courses, in the SEQ10502 folder under Course Topics, and you'll find a SEQShortEX folder, there is an example where the SEQ Film, and if you double-click on this, you can see the entire film is contained within this main film level sequence. This film level sequence can be set up to contain subnested level sequences that can break down the film into acts, acts into sequences, and sequences into shots. Also, shots can be varied thanks to Sequencer's take system, and if you've already had the QuickStart Sequencer Shot Creation course, then you've had a little experience with the take system. If not, then in principle, different takes are made by duplicating a shot level sequence and modifying the animation, lighting, or even the staging of any actor within the shot level sequence. Now in Unreal Engine, you're going to come across some terms that we use within the engine that will have a powerful impact on how you organize your level sequence shot assets. That new terminology is the Possessable Actor and the Spottable Actor. So what does this mean? Well, actors within a level sequence can be one of these two categories. Possessable actors are intended to be possessed by each level sequence that calls them into use but ultimately they belong to the level and are active in that level the entire time. Spottable actors exist within the unique level sequence and then disappear when the level sequence is outside of its play range or no longer active. Basically, a spottable is like pulling a book down from a bookshelf, reading it, and then putting it away to use again when needed. Each of these can prove beneficial depending on your needs and workflows, but one thing to note is that the Epo storyboarding tools do not currently support spottable actors at this time. Now in our next section, we're going to go ahead and look at core structures as we look at how Unreal Engine translates film concepts into the game engine.",
