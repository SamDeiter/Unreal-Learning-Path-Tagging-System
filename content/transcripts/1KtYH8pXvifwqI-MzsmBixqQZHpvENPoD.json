  "text": " Blueprint Visual Script is the high level representation of the low level C++ that makes up the Unreal Engine source code. Typically, when you're actually compiling your source code down into its machine language, which means you are packaging it out basically to create your final product, which you are going to give to your user or player, it goes through a simple source code compiling process. In Unreal, in Blueprints, it actually has a couple of extra layers injected into it. Blueprints, because of their nature, they're actually looking at C++ and showing it back to you. This does mean that it's actually a little bit slower because there are a couple of extra steps. But when we actually package stuff out, we have a kind of a way of helping speed this up to sort of nativeise your Blueprint to C++ code. So instead of going through just two steps, you go through about five. So you start off with Blueprints, then through the compiler, then to bytecode, then into the virtual machine, and then your packaged product. So things will get faster after packaging.",
