  "text": " Now we're going to have a little bit of fun with our physics character. We're going to do what's called a pachinko machine, in which we're going to drop our mani or multiple manis onto a pachinko machine, which is a series of blocks that the character will react to and hopefully slip all the way down to the ground. Physics is an unknown factor, so who knows where we'll wind up, but let's get started. So as you can see here, we can build them in different ways. Yours does not have to look the same way. The only thing you want to make sure, however, is that your character is centered on that. Otherwise he may slip in the front and you don't get the full effect of the pachinko. We're going to go ahead and set that up. So let's go ahead and get into our project yet again. Set up this final fun thing. Navigating there, we can go ahead and close this. We're done with this. Hit compile and save if you haven't already. Just make sure all the saves are there. And we can grab these two characters as we wish. We already have the physics activated as well as the collisions. So we're good on that. I'm going to grab them. I'm going to bring them way, way up so you can zoom all the way out. So we want them to be pretty high. And the reason is as we record, as we'll find out here in a bit, it's going to react a little different and we're going to need some time for them to drop. So it's going to just bring it on up. This is all about setup here, getting that where we want it. We may raise them up even higher, but what we want to do is you can either grab one of these cubes and start building, which we can do right here. Go up. I'm going to rotate this and zoom in a little bit. Rotate it. I'll do it at 40. And now to reproduce, this is the nice part is you can hold down the control and drag. Rather the alt and drag, not control. I'm going to hold alt and drag. My hands were not where my feet and my mouth were. Just kind of hold that again, grab it where you want. And you want to leave plenty of space for the character, but not too much because they'll just slip all the way through it. And again, you can grab then all of these holding shift. That there, then we'll hit the alt key and hold up. We're going to about like that for maybe bring it over. You can kind of see where I'm going with this. Keep going up. The alt key again, dragging up. You bring it over this way again. If you feel like the spacing is wrong, no problem. This is just purely experimental and having fun one more time, I think would be kind of cool. It's a lot like that. Maybe bring it down a little bit more. I think I want a little bit more, less space rather. Click all these guys and bring them all down equally. If you notice they don't slip all the way through the way you want, you may want to adjust them. But again, this is just a play around to get to see how the physics work. Okay, great. I think that's good enough. And you'll notice our characters are way off. So we're going to need to grab both of those characters and bring them over here. Make sure you don't only grab those two. And you'll see I grabbed the sphere control out of that because we don't want to include the sphere. You can't accidentally grab the character beyond the characters. You can actually grab the floor. And I've done this where the physics and the floor dropped away, which is not what I wanted. All right, so we've got that there. That looks pretty high. It looks like we're pretty good. If not, you can adjust each individual. You can even do perspective and look at the top just to see where we're at. See where our characters are lying. Now, there we go. This is merely just the top view. I'm going to kind of do that. Rotate the character, I think a little bit more there so they're dead on. Same with this character. Okay, we come back over here to perspective. There we go. All right, I think our characters are where I want them. If you feel like this isn't wide enough, you can also extend those out. But I think this will work for our purposes. Okay, so we are ready to go. What's the next thing we have to make sure that everything is set correctly. So that's going to be our next part is setting up the physics simulation to make sure they are ready to go. Before we start to get into recording, let's run a simulation. So be sure to change this to a simulate and not an actual playing so that we can watch this in real time. Be it played for the simulate. We'll see our characters fall and this one's still stuck. He's stuck in the middle. That can happen. That's all right. That's why I have two characters. You can shift things around if you need to. You can just keep simulating. You see it's going to be a problem. You can probably move a cube or delete a cube, whatever you want. You can even move your character around a little bit. Maybe move them to the side a little bit more. Either way, just keep playing around until you get an effect that kind of is where you want. Here we go. That looks good. Perfect. All right, so now that we have this completely set up, we are going to move into the next section of using take recorder to record sequences that we can later edit within sequencer.",
