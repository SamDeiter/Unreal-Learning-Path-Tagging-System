  "text": " Coming back to our zombie walk, you know, we're pretty happy with the lower body, but I think maybe we should experiment a bit more with the upper body and with the arms. So for that we're going to use the layered blend per bone node. Now this allows us to selectively blend different animations together on different parts of the body. So we could split up the body into different groups of bones, giving us a really easy way to separate things like the upper and lower body or the arms and the legs and just affect those parts of the body with the animations that we want. In our Anim Graph, I'm going to right click and search for layered blend per bone and bring in our layered blend per bone node here. I'll also bring in the creep walk, which is, if I remember rightly, the basis of our zombie animation and connect that to the output pose and tick looping. And if we compile, there we go, we have our creep walk playing. I'm then going to bring in our fall loop animation, because if I double click this to open it up, I know it has some upper body animation on there, but I think it adds some coolness to the zombie walk. So if I plug that into our blend pose's zero pin and set that to looping again and compile, you can see that it's not yet having an effect on our animation. And that's just because we haven't defined which bones we want the animation to play on yet. So selecting our layered blend per bone node again. In the details panel under the config heading, we have layer setup. And inside there, we've got index zero. Now this is relating to our blend pose's zero input pin. If I was to hit add pin, you'll see we get a new index. So when you want to blend multiple animations together, that's how you do it. But we'll take a look at that in a bit. So under this index heading, we have branch filters, where we can add multiple branches and split this animation into different parts of the body or apply it to different parts of the body. So if I hit a plus there, we add a new index. And I'm going to give it the name of the first bone in the chain that we want to affect. And because we want to affect the upper body, I'm going to give it spine 04. So that's going to affect the upper chest and everything above that. So if I compile, you can see on the lower body, we have the creep walk playing. And then the upper body, the fall loop. Because we have our alpha set to one, that's going to play 100% of the fall loop animation. So if I was to change that to 0.5, for example, you can see that we're now blending half of that animation and we've got some of that creep walk movement underneath. Now this is looking kind of cool, but I think we can get something a little better if we break the body up into a few more pieces. So back into our layered blend per bone node, I'm going to add another pin here, duplicate this fall loop animation with Ctrl D and connect that to our blend poses one pin, because I still like the way that this fall loop animation is affecting our pose and our animation, but I want to break it up so that perhaps we have a different strength of this animation on maybe the arms compared to what we have on the spine. So we now have this new index here. And under the branch filters, I'm going to add two new branches, one for each arm. So our start bone name is going to be clavicle L for the left arm. And bone name for the right arm, clavicle R. So if I compile, as you can see, because our blend strength, blend weight, should I say, is set to one, we're getting 100% of that fall loop animation on the two arms and 50% of the animation on the spine. So I could tweak this again to something like 0.7 maybe and then compile. So we still get some of that underlying creep walk animation on the arms, but we also have the interesting pose from the fall loop. Now this is looking kind of cool so far, but the head is maybe looking a little too stable. And I think with zombies, they're always a little bit wobbly and maybe the head is like snapping at you, trying to bite you. And something that I would think would work quite well for that is the run forward animation, because this has got a lot more movement in it and a lot more action going on. So if I add a new pin and plug that into Blend Pose, it's two. And just make sure we're looping that animation. I'm going to cut off the head and just apply this run forward to the head. So if I just shrink down these two indexes and open up on Nuist and add a new branch, I'm going to use neck underscore 01 because I know that that's the first neck bone and we're going to affect everything after that to the tip of the head. So already you can see that's something kind of cool there. It's maybe a little bit strong, but you can imagine him kind of snapping and biting at you. Maybe I can reduce it down to 0.8 perhaps. Yeah that's looking kind of cool there. So I think we could probably call the zombie animation done there. Now you could do the same sort of thing with this animation where you could record it out and create a loop of the animation again. You could also open the animation sequencer and bake that down to a control rig, which will give you much more control over the loop, making sure that there's no pop and you can add in any cool little details that you want to add to really polish it up.",
