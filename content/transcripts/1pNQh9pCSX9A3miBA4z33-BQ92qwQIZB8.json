  "text": " So that was a bit of a whistle-stop tour on the kind of fundamental building blocks of getting gameplay working. But one thing we also really need to touch on is garbage collection. As already mentioned, Unreal is a garbage collected engine. It's built on top of C++, which obviously isn't garbage collected, but that functionality has been implemented over the top. As mentioned earlier, most of the Unreal garbage collection system is managed through the reflection macros. So if we want something garbage collected, it essentially needs to be marked up either as a Uclass, UStructure or UProperty. The way garbage collection actually works is that Unreal keeps a root set of UObjects that acts as the base for the garbage collector's kind of iterative searches. We'll touch on the root set in just a second to go into any more detail about how that works. Actors can be explicitly destroyed, and that's how we easily remove things from that root set. Once an actor has been destroyed, it will get cleaned up by the garbage collector at the next garbage collection. This also means that any properties or any components on that actor that aren't already being referenced by other things will get cleaned up. An actor's own components will get automatically garbage collected at that point too. So just going into a little bit about how the root set actually works. Like we said, Unreal maintains a kind of core root set of objects. You can add objects to this root set yourself if you need to, but if we were to kind of step through a garbage collection flow, the way Unreal begins is it assumes that every object outside of that root set is unreachable. So it marks everything as needing garbage collection. It then goes through a series of iterative searches to try and build up connections where it can to see what is and is not reachable. So in this example here, we have an object which references down a chain, and we can see now all of these objects are reachable, and therefore none of them would get garbage collected. If at the end of this iterative search any of these objects didn't have other objects referencing them, then that would be marked up for garbage collection and cleaned up. If at some point we were to break one of these connections, so say for example, Object 1 here was our level world, and we've destroyed an actor. So Object 3 is an actor, we've destroyed it. That would be breaking its connection with the world, and therefore the root set, and therefore both the actor and the actor's component would get garbage collected. So it's not just the reflected types that can get garbage collected. It's not just a U class or a U struct. We can do it in another way. If we have non-U objects that we need to still handle garbage collection, we can inherit from the FGC object class, and that just implements this function of add referenced objects, and that way you can add in references to U objects and any type that inherits from that to a non-U object class. You just need to make sure that you implement those functions, and within that function you reference each one of the objects that you need to be seen by the garbage collector. When working with garbage collection, there's a couple of key things to bear in mind. So whenever we're talking about U objects, that manipulation isn't thread safe. It's highly, highly recommended that we only manipulate and access U objects on the game thread. It is possible to do it on other threads, but we need to use proper use of synchronization techniques and primitives to make sure that we don't get parallel programming errors. So be cautious because that can lead to performance hitches. The garbage collector can't see raw pointers inside U objects, so even though the Unreal reflection system looks inside U classes and U structs, if you have raw pointers, they're just not going to be seen by garbage collection. So you either need a U object with U property markup, or you can also use the shared pointer library, which we'll get onto in a moment. Last of all, we can mark objects for pending kill, which is essentially our manual way of sending an object for garbage collection. Actors can be destroyed, that's kind of a distinct thing, but generally we can mark an object up for pending kill. Pending being the key word there because when you do that, it's not instantly deleted from the root set. That simply breaks that connection, and the next time garbage collection actually gets run, that's when the object will be removed from memory. So it's only at the point of garbage collection. Pending kill simply says, this will get garbage collected the next time we run garbage collection.",
