  "text": " Sequencer is Unreal Engine 5's editor for creating and editing linear animations, but it can also be used for so much more than that. You can actually use Sequencer for gameplay events to help you generate movies or promotional items. It can be used pretty much like an offline renderer or in a real-time capacity. Let's pop into the editor now and see more about how this tool works. First off, to create and work with Sequencer, we need to create something called a Level Sequence. To do that, there's a number of different ways. We can right-click inside of here and we can come down to Hour. I believe it is under Cinematics. We can create a Level Sequence or an Animation Sequence or a Template Sequence. We can come up here to the Sequences up here and we can either add a Level Sequence or add a Level Sequence with a Shots Track. The difference between them is this. A Level Sequence will allow us to have one shot, but a Level Sequence with a Shots Track will allow us to have a Level Sequence with multiple cameras inside of it. Let's say that we know we're going to be using five or six cameras because we have five or six camera cuts. Instead of setting those all up for us one by one, we can click the Add Level Sequence with Shots to have those five shots already created for us. For now though, I'm just going to select this Add Level Sequence and we're going to call this LS Underscore Example. When I do that, you're going to notice something a little bit different happens. All of a sudden, the sequence opens up. If I hit Ctrl Space, we can see it's right there. We can close Sequencer just by hitting that X and then open it anytime by just clicking on the sequence to open it up. One of the cool things about Sequencer is we can add transforms or rotations or pretty much anything that we want just as long as we see one of these little keyframes. Any property can actually be keyframed if it has one of those little diamonds next to it. Let's just take a quick look at the editor itself. Across the top here, we're going to have our main toolbar. This is our actors that we want to put in here. There's our save. There's our browse. This creates a new camera and sets it to the new camera cut. This allows us to render things out if we want to take a pre-rendered video or something like that. This opens up our blueprints. These are our actions. There's a whole bunch of different things inside of here. These are our view options. We have our playback options and then our keyframe and our snapping as well as our playback speed and our curve editor. Now, to add something to Sequence, what you can do is select it inside the viewport and then come here to add. We can add the Newey logo. We can look for it or we can add selected from the content browser. For me, I'm just going to add this new Newey logo. You can see as soon as I do that, it adds a track. This works just the same as any linear based editor. We put down keyframes and then we move this over like this and then we maybe go like that. You can see here it's automatically actually going to make that keyframe motion for me. There we go. To work with one of these properties, it's the same way. Let's come up here to our maybe we'll do our transform. We'll do something like, I don't know, add a keyframe. And actually it's in auto mode, so I don't even need to add one, but you can see here it's doing that. We can also take multiple objects. So let me just come here and we're going to go add a point light. There we go. Where is that? Let's hit G so we can kind of see where that is. There we go. So let's just add that, add to sequencer, add our point light. There we go. And then we can do something like our intensity is set to 8, but we come here. Maybe we set it to like 80. So you know, maybe we set it back to 8. There we go. So it's kind of like making a little, let's move this a little bit closer to the ground. There we go. There we go. Something like that. So just showing you can have multiple different actors in the same sequence all going off. Now to actually play this sequence inside of your project, you will need to set up a little bit of blueprint logic just to fire off the sequence when the level plays. But other than that, sequences are a fantastic way to create any type of interactive cinematic or content or linear based content that you wish and have it rendered all in real time, output to video, and it can really cut down on production times, especially again if you're using this for any type of linear based media.",
