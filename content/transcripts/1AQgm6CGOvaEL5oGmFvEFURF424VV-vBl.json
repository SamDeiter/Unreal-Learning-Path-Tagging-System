  "text": " The last thing that we're going to take a look at in the demonstration is the Aim node. And I just want to show you a different way to control where our gun is pointing. Now this might be useful if you want to be able to lock onto or track something. Or essentially if you always want something to be aiming at something else and not have to sort of manually animate the rotation to account for that. So to get this set up, the first thing I'm going to do is just bring our forward solve out here a little bit and search for a sequence node. And this is just so we can kind of split the logic into two flows and understand things a bit more clearly. So first we'll plug in all the logic that we had and then down here I'm going to search for an Aim node. Now we're just getting a warning there because we haven't set anything up yet but we have connected the logic. So by default the thing that the Aim node is looking for is a bone. But what we're going to do is actually utilise the set up we have for these controls where we've set the limits and it's already controlling our bones and actually aim the control instead. And to make things a little bit more mechanically accurate we're actually going to split the rotation between these two controls so that as we move this sort of Aim control around that we're going to create in a moment, our turret will move up and down on this axis with this control and rotate the entire body with this control. So we're essentially splitting the yaw and the pitch rotations between the turret base control and the main gun control. So first we'll set up the turret base because that's going to be first in the chain of bones essentially. So if we select our turret base control and just press this arrow here, I'm just going to disconnect it so that we don't get any funky results until we've set it up properly. I'm going to pop open the axis, the target space and secondary here. So under the axis for this control we need turret base to be minus one in y and zero in x and then we need to be one in z for our target. And our target space is going to be the control that we're going to create that will affect the aim of these. So we're going to create it from the main gun bone. So if I select the main gun, press control N, we'll get a new control. And I'm just going to call this cannon aim control. And with this control we want it to be out in front of the cannon so that we can move it around and have it point towards it. So what I'm going to do in just the x axis, because that's the axis that our bone is pointing and the axis that this gun is currently aiming, is I'm just going to drag that out to some distance in front of the actual mesh. And under the scale I'll just set it to 10 and let's just change the colour and perhaps even the shape, something like a wedge might be cool. Oh and one thing I forgot to do there before I compiled is actually set the offset transforms from this control's current position so that's why it popped back to its original location. So if I drag that back out again, right click, set offset transforms from current. When I compile, this is the control's new offset transform. So we're going to use this as our aim control so as we move it left and right, up and down, we want our turret and our turret body to be pointing towards it. So with that control selected, I'm going to pop open target space here, oops not under secondary. Target space here, just under the primary heading and input that as our control. And when we connect up the logic, if I just grab our sequence node here, hit compile, what we'll hopefully see is that when we move it left and right, our control, which is controlling the main body of the gun, is actually rotating left and right with it. And if we move it up and down, forwards and backwards, we're not getting any other movement. There is a little bit just because it's off axis now. But if I compile that, move it up and down, we don't get anything there. Move it backwards and forwards, we don't get anything there. And that's just because we've set up the limits on this control already. So we don't have to do anything extra with the bones to sort of clamp their rotation. We're relying on the settings of these controls to do all of that for us. Now let's set up the rotation for the actual gun turret itself. I'm just going to bring this down here a little bit so we have enough space. And drag off here, search for an aim node once more. And our target is going to be the same control. And under the target in axis, this time we're going to leave the settings as they are. And selecting our, if I just compile it to make sure it's at zero, selecting our main gun control, that's going to be what we want to use to aim towards this cannon aim control. So now if I move this left and right, we have the movement on the turret body. And if I move it up and down, we should have the movement from the main gun. And again, that's locked in terms of how much it can rotate. Because of the settings that we created or the values that we set up, should I say, for that control itself. So you could pin this somewhere in the world. And then as the rest of the mech is moving around, it would always track this one location. Or you know, the mech could be standing still and you could be moving this location and locking it onto some sort of target that it's trying to aim and fire at. Now one thing to note is that it's going to override the control of the turret base and the main gun controls. But you could do something like set up a switch that will toggle between these two different control types, depending on which one you'd like to use.",
