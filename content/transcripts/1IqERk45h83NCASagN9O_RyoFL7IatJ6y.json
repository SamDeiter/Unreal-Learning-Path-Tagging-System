  "text": " And then we've got some of the other bits of functionality. So what we've covered so far is the various ways that data can boil through. But once we're working within code, understanding things about our network environment can become quite important. So this isn't so much about dormancy. This is more about when you're writing your code, when you're writing, whether or not something is replicated, kind of knowing whether you're on the server, whether you're on a client, what your current configuration state is becomes quite important. And that's where things like net mode come in. So net mode, again, this is probably more of an Unreal bespoke specific kind of end of things. But it may have a corollary on other proprietary software that you've worked with. But essentially, net mode is the most airtight, watertight way of checking what your current state is. We've talked in previous sessions about the idea of using with client code pragmas, with server code pragmas. But we've also talked about the fact that in editor, on standalone, both of those things will be true. So we can't always trust code that we write within those pragmas to only be suitable for the client, to only be suitable for the server. And so that's where net mode comes in. Net mode can essentially have four states. It can be standalone, dedicated server, listen server, or client. So standalone, I think we've talked about this configuration in our first session. But essentially, this is running in total isolation. So we never have to worry about a server coming in, writing into our data. We never have to worry about sending our data elsewhere. This is kind of a local build of our game. So if we have a game that is somehow both single player and multiplayer, maybe that would be the situation you're in here. You might be in standalone. But for the most part, if you're making a single player game and you queried your net mode of any of your actors, then net mode would be standalone. Dedicated server is the kind of opposite. It's where nothing in the game is being played. We already talked about the kind of role of a dedicated server. So this is purely when we are the server. So we're not going to have any local controllers. The only players are going to be kind of simulated players that are actually going to be remote connections. They're going to be dealt with on another PC. So we are responsible for sending data to them. But us ourselves, well, we are the server. So we're the thing responsible for managing all the authoritative state about the game. But also, we know we're not going to be displaying any visuals. We know we don't need to be displaying effects or playing sound effects or anything like that. Then we've got listen server. Again, we've talked about the role of the listen server already. But in this context, we are both a server and a client. So this net mode listen server is only going to be true for the person who is the listen server. Everyone else is going to be a client. So if I am hosting an online co-op game, and I am the host, and I'm hosting the server locally, then it's quite likely I would be a listen server then. And that means I am both a client playing, and I am a server responsible for sending all the information of my local machine out to other connected clients. So that's that situation. And then last of all, we have client, which is the opposite of dedicated server, where we're expecting to be not the authority for almost any data in the game. Or most of the authoritative data about the game is going to be coming into us. We're not going to be sending a huge amount out. It is our responsibility to send particular updates to the server, so things like input or state changes that we know are only local changes. Again, I talked about customizations maybe being an example of that. Net mode is something that we often need to query about what our current context is, and therefore what our responsibility is for sending information. Obviously, if we are the client, that's the time where we might need to be calling server functions to send information to the server about our local updates. If we are a server, either a dedicated server or a listen server, then it's our responsibility to be sending information out to other connected clients. If we're a listen server, we also know that we are going to maintain a certain amount of local state. And that's where it becomes important to bear in mind things like not necessarily trusting your replicated using functions to get called, because it's not actually going to get replicated because it's local. So all of these things all have various meanings and permutations in different scenarios. Next, we have net role. And this can easily be confused with net mode, but it's important to talk about it's actually these are two quite distinct and importantly distinct things. So these two things are not interchangeable. Net role is essentially to describe who has authority over a given entity. So the three situations you can have are role authority, role simulated proxy, or role autonomous proxy. Authority lets us know essentially whether who basically controls the data about this actor. So if we go for net role authority, this is typically going to be the case for most things on the server. The server has authority over the vast majority of the game data. But in the situation of we go to play an attack animation and we hit against a wall, then we might spawn some visual effect actors, we might spawn some sound effects. The server doesn't need to know about those things. We are going to spawn those sound effects and those visual effects locally to our player. The server doesn't need to care about them. And therefore, those actors are our responsibility. We are full control over them. We will have a unique copy of those things. It literally doesn't matter if we're client A. It doesn't matter if client B never knows about them. It's kind of their responsibility to spawn their own visuals and sound effects if they need them. But we've just kind of done this locally. In that situation, the remote client would have the authority over those sound effects, over those locally spawned, over the sound effects, over the visual effects. You would also be the authority for any of your UI. Because again, this is not being controlled by the server. You, as the local player, as a local connected client, are the authority over any changes that are happening to that data are something that you, as the local computer, are in control of. The other situation, obviously, is that we are the server, in which case, we are the authority for the vast majority of the data, in which case, it's our responsibility to replicate data to other things. If we are in control of that data, we need to send that data out to all the simulated entities. Again, obviously, authority, when we are a listen server, we have authority over both of those things. We have authority over our local UI, over our locally spawned visual effects and sound effects. And we also have authority over the positions of all the enemies, because we are also the server. So again, that's why these two things don't necessarily line up, because they are different in different scenarios. Simulated proxy is when an actor is spawned on the server and replicated down to the local client, but it is owned by another client. So this is going to be something like the enemy players in your game, they are going to be simulated proxy. So all you're receiving is a simulated representation of that thing. The server is controlling it. The server might be getting information about it from a different client, but ultimately, all you need to know is this is being controlled from elsewhere. You do not have control over it. You do not have responsibility for it. You're just getting all this information, essentially, from the server. And then last of all, we have autonomous proxy. Autonomous proxy is when it's spawned on the server, but it's the local machine that has a degree of control over it. So this is going to be your local player controller, your pawn. These are going to be autonomous proxies. So it's the server that actually has control over the data, but you have a degree of responsibility for making changes about it and sending those things to the server to say, hey, server, I've updated my position. And so please be notified of that. The server may make corrections and things like that. But yeah, autonomous proxy is going to describe your role as a player for the things that you are kind of player controlling.",
