00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
UB-5 provides a sky atmosphere actor that you can place in your scene and then configure

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.939
to help simulate a planet's atmosphere.

3
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.920
On this actor you will find a number of different controls that allow you to adjust how the

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.920
atmosphere will look and react to lighting, as well as a number of controls that will

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.920
allow you to adjust the look without adjusting the physical plausibility.

6
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.719
Let's go ahead and take a look at this inside of the editor now.

7
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.320
So inside of the editor I just have a file, a new level here, and I selected the open

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.680
world template because this will be set up with everything that we need.

9
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
So if we come over here to lighting and we look for our sky atmosphere, you're going

10
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.200
to see that actor right there.

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.000
If we look down we have a number of different parameters that we can adjust here like our

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.680
atmosphere height or the effects of multi-scattering.

13
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.640
We can also change how this is transformed so that we can adjust this based on if we

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.040
are looking again at the ground or if we are looking at this in space.

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.920
There are also a number of other parameters around here, each with their own setting on

16
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.040
how this is going to affect the look and the feel of this atmosphere.

17
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.960
One of the other cool things about this whole system is that it does work with the directional

18
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.200
light and the skylight as well as the exponential height fog.

19
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.240
One pro tip, if you do hit control, alt, and L, you will bring up a quick lighting positioning

20
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120
tool which will position the directional light in easy to use manner.

21
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.160
Again, that's the directional light selected here.

22
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.400
We just do control, alt, L, and make sure that we rotate around the scene.

23
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400
And again, this reason that we want to use this is because our sky atmosphere is going

24
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.600
to be slightly different based off of the sun's location and things like that.

25
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.080
So being able to quickly adjust the direction of that directional light to allow us to properly

26
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.880
visualize everything is very important.
