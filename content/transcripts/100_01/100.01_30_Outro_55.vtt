00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
It's now time to wrap up this video tutorial series on an introduction to Unreal.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.080
We started with looking at the Unreal Engine 5 documentation.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.880
Remember that's the best place to get any help you need with any of the various features

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.320
or tools that Unreal Engine 5 provides.

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.839
We then took a look at what we can use the Epic Games Launcher for.

6
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.539
Remember we used that to download various versions of Unreal Engine as well as access

7
00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.160
our Fav library.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.480
We then looked at how Unreal Engine projects are structured because they're working a slightly

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.759
different way than we might be used to using multiple project specific files.

10
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:42.880
We then took a look at the Unreal content pipeline and how we can get various pieces

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.560
of content into the editor so that we can work with them in whatever project we're creating.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.000
We took a look at the editor UI.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.840
We covered what actors are.

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.400
Then we took a look at the various tools and features that Unreal Engine 5 provides

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.000
and how you might be able to utilize those in whatever it is you're creating.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So that's it.

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240
That's going to wrap up this video tutorial series.

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.359
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
