00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Niagara is Unreal Engine 5's visual effects editor, but it's so much more than that.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Niagara can also be used for gameplay interactions, and even updated without the need of an engineer.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's right, you can actually add your own modules to Niagara to develop your own behaviors using a node-based system,

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and you can add functionality that wasn't there, or adjust functionality that is already existing to better meet your needs.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's right, this entire thing is built to be improved upon, but it's also pretty easy for the average user to understand.

6
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's pop into Unreal and have a look at it now.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, in order to get the most out of Niagara, we're going to need to create a Niagara system.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
To do that, I'm going to hit Control Space, and then inside of our content browser here, I'm going to right-click,

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and from our Create Basic Assets, I'm going to select Niagara System.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, because Niagara is such a robust toolset, it is often daunting to start out from a blank slate.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So, there is a wizard system that gives you some examples or some templates to work from.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The templates that we have right here, this is going to do blowing particles or fountain,

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or maybe we have some particles hanging in the air, or maybe we want an upward burst of meshes or something like that.

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is going to give us a great way to get started so that we can quickly build out some effects to our liking.

15
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Lightweight has to deal with a system that requires less rendering resources.

16
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Learning content is, these are some things that go along with our learning content

17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and also show you how to do things like sub-UV animation, particles with unique IDs, or particles that spawn in a grid.

18
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And then last but not least, we have the Niagara Fluids examples.

19
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That is right. With the Niagara Editor, you can create real-time water and smoke,

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and these can even interact with things inside of your scene using collision.

21
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
While this is very, very complicated, now to the scope of this talk,

22
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you can actually look at all of these examples simply by just selecting it and then creating it

23
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and have a look at how all of this is built up.

24
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now, for this one, what we're going to be doing is we're just going to take a look at a quick fountain.

25
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, I'm going to hit Create, I'm going to say NS underscore example,

26
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and let's double-click on it to open it up.

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Alright, so the Niagara Editor should look a little bit familiar

28
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
because like with many of the other editors, it's set up in a similar manner.

29
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Across the top, we have our file, edit, asset, window, tools, and help menus.

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then we have the main toolbar.

31
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The features you'll want to be most concerned with here are your save and browse to asset in the content browser.

32
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The compile button, what this does is this compiles our Niagara system

33
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
in order to make sure that everything is working and nothing is incorrect

34
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or values are not bad or need to be adjusted.

35
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We have our thumbnail button which generates an image thumbnail

36
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to make this easier to see in the content browser.

37
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If I click that now, what should happen when I hit Control Space is we should see that example.

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, it's just showing us right there.

39
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The bounds shows us the rendering bounds of this object.

40
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This is particularly important when we're using something like a GPU particle

41
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
which needs a fixed bound size for rendering.

42
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We have the ability to look at different debugs.

43
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Our simulation allows us to select if it's autoplay, reset on change, or resimulate when paused.

44
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The baker allows us to actually bake this particle into a series of still images that we can then replay.

45
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
What this does is this takes some of the complex calculation out of this particle effect

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and makes it cheaper to run.

47
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Then we have our scalability.

48
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Our preview viewport over here is going to work very similar to the other preview viewports.

49
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We can adjust the things like real time or show our stats or our field of view.

50
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We can also come here and adjust the view and maybe change to an orthographic, a top right or a side view.

51
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We can adjust our lighting.

52
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We can also show things like our execution order or our memory consumption for this particular particle.

53
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Then we can change the background here in case the epic headquarters is distracting.

54
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Over here we have our parameters, local modules, and user parameters.

55
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Parameters are things that come by default with this system.

56
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
For example, age is going to be something or loop count.

57
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
These are all things that every system is going to need in order to act correctly.

58
00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Our location, I always say location, but I mean our local modules are bits of code that we have written specific for this particular effect.

59
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Basically, if we're trying something out and we want to maybe see how it's going to work or something like that,

60
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
we can do that inside of here.

61
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We don't have to expose that to everything else.

62
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Should we just be making an experiment?

63
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now, user parameters, this one is very cool.

64
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
What this allows us to do is expose various parameters inside of our effects so that when we place this in the world,

65
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
we can adjust those parameters accordingly.

66
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, our timeline allows us to adjust, I shouldn't say adjust, allows us to see how this particle is playing in relation to others that might be in this system.

67
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Remember, we can have multiple Niagara admittors and a single Niagara system.

68
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
This timeline can help with the timing of those.

69
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We can set this up because we can pull the little trail heads of these around.

70
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We could have maybe one fountain that goes off and then another fountain that goes off.

71
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We can control the timing of those using these.

72
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
What you cannot do with this timeline is control any of the properties of your material.

73
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Say you wanted to do something like have your particle start at zero and then ramp up the amount of particles it spawns and then stop, say, at five seconds.

74
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That is not something you can do.

75
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
You cannot do keyframed events down here.

76
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Script stats will show us the script stats for this.

77
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's a way for us to get some performance information.

78
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Curves will show us any property that we have marked as a curve and then it will allow us to edit that curve.

79
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It just makes it a little bit easier to edit.

80
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Then we have our log here, which will point out any issues should the system not compile correctly.

81
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Next, we have our details panel.

82
00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Our details panel, like the details panel in most of the editor, is going to be context sensitive and it's going to change based off what I have selected.

83
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now, inside of the system overview, this is where we're going to be spending a lot of time, particularly on this Niagara Admitter.

84
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
When we click the Admitter, what we're going to get in the details panel is all of the details that are available that we have set inside of here.

85
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000
If we want to narrow this down, all we need to do is simply select either one of these drop down areas or the individual module that is in that area to select.

86
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This is simply a way for you to either look at everything that's in there or have a more zoomed in look at what is going on to get rid of some of the noise.

87
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:58.000
To add or remove something, we can right click on this and we can delete it or if we click on this plus sign, we can then add different modules and things like that to our Admitter.

88
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
One of the other things I want to show you before we wrap up is if we come here to say like our spawn rate and we click on this, we're going to look for this,

89
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
make and then we want, I'm sorry, not make, new user and there we go, read from new user parameters.

90
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So if I hit that and I come over to my user parameters, you're going to see we have this spawn rate set at 90.

91
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So let's just compile and save that. I'm going to move this out of the way here and hit control space and just bring this into my level.

92
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So with that there, check out my spawn rate.

93
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I can set that to maybe like a spawn rate of one or 10.

94
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And that's how I expose a parameter for someone to use when this is placed inside of the world.

95
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So they don't actually have to come here and open up the particle editor.

96
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
They can just adjust the spawn rate right in here like you would any other actor.

97
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So that is Unreal Engine's particle editor Niagara.

98
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's very, very, very simple to use, but takes a long time to master.
