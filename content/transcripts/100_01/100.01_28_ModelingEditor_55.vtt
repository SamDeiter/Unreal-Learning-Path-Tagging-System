Unreal Engine 5 has a very powerful set of modeling tools that can be accessed right

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.560
inside of the editor that allow you to not only create messages inside of the engine,

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.839
but also edit existing messages.

4
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.320
And this is fantastic if you ever need to do something like reset a pivot or you want

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600
to maybe fix a minor detail or adjust something in a slight way.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.359
You don't have to go back to your digital content creation tool.

7
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.960
You can do it right from within the engine.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.200
Let's pop over to the editor now and take a quick look at these tools.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.520
So to access the tools, I come up here to my selection and then I come down to my modeling.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.439
Now I can use the modeling mode with a pre-selected static mesh or I can create a static mesh

11
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.439
to model from.

12
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:51.880
So in this instance, I'm just going to create a box here and then once I have that, I'm

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.600
going to say accept.

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.960
With that done, I'm now going to go over to my modeling mode here, go to my Poly Group

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.000
edit and this is going to allow me to do things like extrude this face.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.040
And then I can also move things around and rotate as I would in any other DCC.

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.960
And you can see here I have a number of different options that I can do.

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.640
For example, I could come here and select each one of these edges and then do something

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.960
like a bevel.

20
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.319
So in accept that action.

21
00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.319
And then once I'm all done with everything I can do except and there we go.

22
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.799
Here's my newly modeled mesh, although it's not the world's greatest mesh, but I did model

23
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.639
it right inside of the editor.

24
00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.199
Notice that I also have things like baking of UVs.

25
00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:38.519
I can voxelize my mesh in case I'm making something very complex and I want to cut down

26
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:43.119
on geometry or maybe I just want to wrap it inside of another mesh for some reason to

27
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.399
get that resulting geometry and do something else with it.

28
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.719
There's a bunch of things here that go from simplifying our meshes so that maybe we bring

29
00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.000
in a mesh that is very high poly and we want to simplify it.

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.519
We can do that right within this tool set.

31
00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:03.959
So this is a very, very powerful tool set modeling mode and it can do much, much more

32
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.200
than just model.

33
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.879
And I highly suggest that everybody dig into it to find out all of its benefits for any

34
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.079
of the projects you're working on.
