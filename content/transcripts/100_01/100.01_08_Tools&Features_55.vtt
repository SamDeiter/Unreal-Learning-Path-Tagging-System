The Unreal Engine 5 level editor is a very powerful tool and a tool to spend quite a bit of time in as this is how we build the interactions or projects we wish inside of Unreal Engine 5.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's go ahead and pop into the editor real quick and have a look at it in more detail.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We can navigate through this using the WAS and D keys or the left and right mouse buttons depending on our preference.

4
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The editor viewport is in real time and if we want to adjust something in the editor we can simply click on it.

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Once we do that whatever we click on properties will be displayed inside of the details panel over here allowing us to adjust whatever we wish to adjust.

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Remember this editor is happening in real time so what we see here is going to be the same if we come up to if we press play.

7
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The only time this could be different is if you're deploying to a mobile device or a console as there could be slight differences in the rendering.

8
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But the level editor does provide a very accurate representation of what you could expect the end rendering to be.
