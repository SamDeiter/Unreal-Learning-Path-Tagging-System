The shadowing system in Unreal Engine 5 has been updated to include virtual shadow maps to help deliver consistent higher resolution shadows that work with film quality assets and even enlarge dynamically lit open worlds.

2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Virtual shadow maps are also built to work seamlessly with Unreal Engine 5's nanite visual geometry, Lumen global illumination and reflections, as well as world partition features.

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The images we see on the screen in front of us show us what kind of detail we can get from virtual shadowing.

4
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we take a look at this image, we'll notice that the shadows on the right hand side look fairly crisp, but let's take a look in the very background of this image as this will really help to highlight the true power that virtual shadow maps give us.

5
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
By zooming in on this area and comparing an old version with our previous shadow map technology with the new version, we can see quite a difference in detail.

6
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In the older version, notice there are shadows, but a lot of the detail of the shadows are missing. For example, right here, this should be shadowed.

7
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Instead, we're getting just this little blob right here, which represents the shadowed area.

8
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We're also completely missing shadowing information in this area over here.

9
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Comparing that to using virtual shadow maps, notice the fine detail that we're getting across the entire scene.

10
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There are shadows in places and not only that, but intricate shadow detail throughout this entire area.

11
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And remember, this is representing a very, very small yet scaled up part of the image that you're seeing on the right hand side of the screen.

12
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Finally, the best part about virtual shadow maps is that they are a default feature of Unreal Engine 5, and there is no setting that you need to enable to turn them on.

13
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You just need to simply use the editor and virtual shadow maps will work as intended.
