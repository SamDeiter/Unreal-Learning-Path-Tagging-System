00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
You can access all of your content in Fab from right within the editor by pressing either

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.560
the Fab button that's located next to the Add button and the Content Browser, or by

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.240
clicking the Add button and then from Get Content Clicking Fab.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.080
No matter which method you choose, it will open up the Fab browser, which will then allow

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.160
you to browse, download, and purchase content for any of your projects.

6
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.960
Let's go ahead and take a look at how that works now.

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
So again, we can access this two different ways.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.679
From our Content Browser, we can click on Add and Fab, or we can click on Fab right here.

9
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.280
Once we do that, Fab will open up and I've already been logged in, so that's why you'll

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.000
see some things populate here for me, but if you haven't logged in, you will need to

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.679
log in before you can download items from your library.

12
00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.880
And let's just click on these rocks right here and we'll go Add to my project right

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:04.200
there and we will see in our Megascans here, give it just a moment.

14
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
And there we go.

15
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.200
There is our rock.

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.120
Let me just move this over and here we go.

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.120
So there we go.

18
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.200
There is our asset right from Fab that we can use and then pull right into our project

19
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.040
should we want to use that particular asset.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.960
So again, remember Fab can be accessed from two locations by clicking the Fab icon right

21
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.760
here or by going to Add and clicking on Fab from right here.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:37.000
Once the Fab browser is open, you are then able to browse and purchase, download and

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.520
add to your project any content that you may desire.
