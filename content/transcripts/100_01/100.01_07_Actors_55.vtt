00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.679
Actors are a vital part of any Unreal Engine 5 project, and that's because actors can be

2
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.800
anything that's placed into a level.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
Here we have a collection of just random actors pulled from the editor, starting with a trigger

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960
volume.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.080
We have directional light, there's a static mesh, there's a skeletal mesh, a player start,

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.240
particle effect, even blueprints and other level interactive icons are all actors.

7
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.839
At its base, we can think of as an actor as something that contains a translation,

8
00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.239
a rotation and a 3D scale.

9
00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.719
So it's something that we can place inside of the scene and we can move it around, we

10
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.480
can scale it and we can rotate it.

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.480
Now it doesn't necessarily have to have a visual representation, but it can't.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.119
Actors can also be spawned and destroyed through gameplay code, whether that be C++ or blueprints.

13
00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.039
Let's pop over to the editor now and take a look at some actors.

14
00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.719
Well inside of the content examples here, this is an actor, this BP demo display, and

15
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.239
if I click on the details panel, notice there are some things that I can change with that.

16
00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.519
And it's going to be true for many of the actors that you place.

17
00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:16.959
So if I come up here to quickly add, and I come here to add maybe like a point light,

18
00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.439
you can see here with my point light selected in the details panel, I'm going to have many

19
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.319
different properties that I can select.

20
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.279
And again, as I go through here, I can select many different types of actors and they're

21
00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:30.639
going to have many different types of properties.

22
00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.799
And this is why it's so critical to understand what actors are.

23
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.679
And it's not complicated.

24
00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.719
Remember actors are just simply the term for objects that can be placed or spawned into

25
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.719
any level that you're working with in Unreal Engine 5.
