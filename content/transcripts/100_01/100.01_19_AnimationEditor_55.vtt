Unreal's animation editor isn't a single tool, but a collection of the following five different tools.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There is the animation blueprint editor, the skeletal mesh editor, the skeleton editor, the animation editor, and the physics editor.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And each one of these tools plays a different role when it comes to dealing with animations.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So let's pop over to the editor now and take a look at this.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So inside the editor, I'm going to hit Control Space to bring up my content browser.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For my filters, I'm going to click on Skeletal Mesh and I'm going to bring up this tentacle right here.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And notice as soon as I do that, we are brought into the Skeleton tool, or I should say, I'm sorry, the Skeletal Mesh Editor.

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
From here, we can do things like assign our materials, adjust our LODs, as well as adjust many of the various properties like skin weights, import settings, and things like that.

9
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We also have our Skeleton Editor.

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The Skeleton Editor allows us to adjust the skeleton or the rig that was brought in with this.

11
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
From here, we can right click and we can copy bone names or add sockets or add virtual bones and other things of that nature.

12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This right here opens up our Animation Editor.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The Animation Editor allows us to add notifies or adjust various properties that have been assigned to our animations.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Next to that, we have our Animation Blueprint.

15
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Animation Blueprints are very powerful as they allow you to combine the power of animation and blueprints to do things like set up state machines or have your animations wait for particular input in order to fire off some other type of animation logic.

16
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Last but not least, we have the Physics Authoring tool or the FAT Editor.

17
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This tool right here is used to create the physics bodies that will be used whenever this is used in some types of physics simulation.
