00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
The Unreal Engine 5 Texture Editor is a powerful tool that allows you to adjust various properties

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.240
of your textures once they've been imported into the Engine.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.439
You can quickly access the Texture Editor by double clicking on any texture you see in

4
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.280
the Content Browser or Texture Input you see throughout the Editor.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.600
Let's take a look at the tool in a little more depth by going over to the Editor now.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.199
Once we're in the Editor, I'm going to hit Control Space to bring up my Content Browser.

7
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.000
Then I'm going to go over here to Texture.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.839
Once I do that, I'm going to double click on this Bark Texture and you'll notice as soon

9
00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.320
as I do that, I'm brought to the Texture Editor.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.679
The Texture Editor should look kind of similar with the File, Edit, Asset, Window, Tools,

11
00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:51.320
and Help menu across the top as many of the other editors in Unreal Engine 5 have.

12
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.239
Next what we have is our Save and our Browse to Asset.

13
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.840
Remember this Browses to this Asset in the Content Browser.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.600
Then we have Reimport which allows us to reimport this asset from the location it was imported

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.240
from.

16
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.880
Then we have the ability to isolate the red, green, blue, or alpha channels of this Texture.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.439
This is useful if you're using a masked workflow and you want to isolate each channel for further

18
00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.480
inspection.

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.879
Next to that we have the ability to adjust which MIP level is currently being displayed.

20
00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:27.800
This will allow us to further inspect that in case there are issues.

21
00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.640
Now for those of you who are unaware, MIP maps are generated for you by default if the

22
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.319
Texture you have imported is a power of two in the X and the Y axis.

23
00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.479
We covered this in a few slides in the beginning of this presentation.

24
00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.439
Next to that we have the ability to zoom.

25
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.280
This allows us again to just kind of get a closer inspection on our Texture here.

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.719
We can also do this by using the middle mouse wheel and scrolling up or down.

27
00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.400
Next to that we have our preview platform.

28
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.280
This allows us to adjust the Texture compression settings here to emulate what it would look

29
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.560
like on an Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, TV, or Windows device.

30
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.520
Our Details panel allows us to look at some important information at the top such as the

31
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.199
imported size, displayed size, and max end game size of this Texture.

32
00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.800
We can also see the resource size or the amount of memory that this is going to consume.

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.439
These numbers up here are important because we can actually constrain our textures to

34
00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.439
have a different resolution than what they were originally imported with.

35
00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.400
This can help in terms of memory as remember reducing Texture size will help reduce the

36
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.080
amount of resources this will consume.

37
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.360
On the right hand side of that we have a method streamed format DTX, supports format Alpha

38
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.680
false, combined LOD bias zero, number of MIPs 11, and our end code speed final.

39
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.240
Out of these settings the ones that you need to pay most attention to are method streamed,

40
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.360
format, and number of MIPs.

41
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.560
Remember that if we want to use Unreal Engine's advanced Texture Streaming System we need to

42
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.040
make sure that our textures are a power of two in the X and the Y axis and if they are

43
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.840
then this method stream will show up right here and we want to see that as well as the

44
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.400
number of MIP maps.

45
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.960
With that we have our level of detail, compression, texture, adjustment, file pass, and compositing

46
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960
sections.

47
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.159
Let's take a look at these in detail.

48
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.879
So level of detail what this does is this controls how our MIP maps are generated.

49
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.759
In the MIP GIN settings right here if we click on this drop down we have the ability to either

50
00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.680
sharpen or blur.

51
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.400
So if I was to say blur this and let's just do like a blur five and I come here to my

52
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.599
LOD bias which allows us to bias this or change the size of the LOD.

53
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.920
You can see here that that is very very very blurry and that's not really what I want.

54
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.840
So I'm just going to go, actually I'm just going to reset this default so that you can

55
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.240
see what that actual option does right here.

56
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.759
So this is just a little pro tip.

57
00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.520
Anytime you set something and you want to get back to what you were before and you don't

58
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.480
know just press this and you will automatically go back to the default.

59
00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:18.000
Another group down here what this allows us to do is set this texture to another group

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.879
and we can control these groups through our INIs and the groups allow us to control settings

61
00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.519
that we're seeing inside of this texture editor should we want to adjust all of the textures

62
00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:32.759
in our project.

63
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.599
Compression deals with how this is going to be compressed.

64
00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.639
Now one thing that we might want to consider enabling is this compressed without alpha.

65
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.639
The reason for this is that alpha textures take up about two times as much memory because

66
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.159
alpha information is uncompressed.

67
00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:53.479
Because of this we want to make sure that any textures we're using do not accidentally

68
00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:54.959
contain alpha information.

69
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.759
So by making sure that compressed without alpha is enabled when we import a texture

70
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.219
the alpha information will be removed even if it was there by accident.

71
00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.919
The other setting that we need to be aware of here is our compression settings.

72
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.080
What this allows us to do is adjust the different compression methods that are used on this

73
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080
texture.

74
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.319
Now most of the time default or normal map which Unreal will set for you will be okay.

75
00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.280
But if you happen to be dealing with something like maybe a mask or a vector displacement

76
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.120
or maybe a HDR image that's where you'll want to change these settings right here in order

77
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.840
to accommodate for that compression method.

78
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:41.399
Under texture we have our padding and resizing and what this will do is this will allow us

79
00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:47.599
to take non-power of two textures and modify them in a way that turns them into a power

80
00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.759
of two texture.

81
00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:58.479
And then sRGB right here this makes sure that we enable or disable gamma correction.

82
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.639
This is highly important for dealing with a mask or a normal map we always want to make

83
00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.159
sure we have this turned off.

84
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.040
This allows us to adjust various properties of this texture.

85
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.880
So for example if I want to make it a little bit darker I can do something like that.

86
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.960
If I want to make it a little brighter I can do something like that.

87
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.040
The great part is also remember that this is non-destructive even if I was to save this

88
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.960
by adjusting it I could simply come back here and undo that setting and it would go right

89
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.320
back to the way it was before.

90
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.720
Our file path shows us the file and the date stamp of when this was edited and then compositing

91
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.480
deals with compositing when we composite with this.
