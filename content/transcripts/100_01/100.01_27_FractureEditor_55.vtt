00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
Unreal Engine 5's Fracture mode is actually part of the Chaos Destruction toolset, and

2
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.120
this allows you to create cinematic quality fractures that run with real-time performance.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.000
The Fracture Editor allows you to create fractured versions of any static mesh that can be used

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.879
to help increase the realism of destruction no matter how that destruction is caused.

5
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.760
Within the Fracture Editor, you have full control over how something should look when

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.640
it fractures, and you can even add multiple levels of destruction, allowing you further

7
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.480
control over how something looks when it starts to be fractured during the middle of its fracture

8
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.679
and its final, end-destructed state.

9
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.680
Let's pop over to the Editor now and take a look at this tool in a little more in-depth.

10
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.560
Now first, before I start, I do need to get something to do Fracture, so I'm going to

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.719
come up here to my shapes and add a sphere.

12
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.719
There we go.

13
00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.439
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up here to my selection mode and go to Fracture.

14
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:06.480
Now with the Fracture tool open, the first thing I need to do is create a geometry collection.

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.980
I'm going to do that right there.

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm going to go ahead and just leave this all default and just press the Create Geometry

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Collection.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There we go.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.519
Now once that has taken place, the next thing that I need to do is come down to the actual

20
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.039
Fracture, and you can see there's multiple options here.

21
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.039
For this demo, though, we're just going to click on Uniform, and then as soon as I do

22
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.000
that, I want to hit the Fracture button right there.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.240
That's going to actually fracture stuff.

24
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.800
Now I can explode things out to see how my fracture takes place.

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.640
One of the other things I'm going to do here is I'm going to take this Break Damage Propagation

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.080
and set that up to like five so that we can see what happens when I press Play here.

27
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.719
We should be getting some.

28
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.640
Might need to just bring this up a little bit higher in the level.

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.200
Let's just do that one more time.

30
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
There we go.

31
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
That's what we wanted to see.

32
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.519
That's the first thing, Break Apart.

33
00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:57.960
So again, just needed to bring it up a little bit higher, but that is the Fracture tool.

34
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.799
Again, it's very simplistic to use, but it can give you really finite control over how

35
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.960
your fractured objects are going to look, increasing the realism no matter what your

36
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.599
end target happens to be.
