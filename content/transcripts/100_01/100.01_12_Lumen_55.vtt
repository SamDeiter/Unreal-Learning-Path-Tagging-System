00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
Unreal Engine 5 provides a very powerful yet flexible lighting solution called Lumen.

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.000
Lumen is a fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system that is designed for

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.039
next generation consoles and PCs.

4
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.280
It renders diffuse inner reflections with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.879
in large detailed environments at ranges from a few millimeters to a kilometer.

6
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:33.000
And one of the greatest features of Lumen is that there's not a lot that you have to

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.920
do to enable it or use it.

8
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.840
You simply set up your scene, add and adjust your lights as normal and Lumen will work in

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.079
the background for you.
