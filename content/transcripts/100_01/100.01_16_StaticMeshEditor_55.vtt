00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
Unreal Engine 5's Static Mesh Editor allows you to view and edit the properties of any

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.320
static meshes that you have imported or downloaded from the FAB marketplace.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.240
Inside of this editor, you can do things like enable Nanite, adjust LOD settings, or adjust

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.839
collision settings, and even add sockets or disable properties that affect how the static

5
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.900
mesh is rendered.

6
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.379
You can also look at mesh properties such as vertex colors, the pivot, and even the

7
00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.379
normals.

8
00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.820
Let's take a look at this inside the Engine now.

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.859
Now to access this tool, all we need to do is simply double click on any static mesh.

10
00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.060
Once we do that, it will automatically open up that mesh inside of the Static Mesh Editor,

11
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:54.179
and then we can edit its properties on the right hand side underneath the Details panel.

12
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.299
Some other things to note here are the properties that we see on the left hand side.

13
00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:06.420
This can give us information such as our triangles, vertices, UV channels, and approximate size.

14
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.620
We can also view our UVs, our collision, and should we want to adjust the pivot of this

15
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.140
by enabling the modeling tools.

16
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.460
We can also re-import or re-import this mesh with dialogue, which allows us to re-import

17
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.099
this mesh with new settings.

18
00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:29.419
Finally, the Save button allows us to save any of the settings that we have adjusted

19
00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:35.179
over here, ensuring that this will be saved to disk so that when we reopen this tool or

20
00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.060
use this asset in another location, those settings have been saved and applied.
