1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.939
In this section of our tutorial I'd like to talk about the editor UI and go over how we

2
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.700
navigate through the editor as well as how we play and what some of the various menus

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.700
do.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.740
Now the editor itself is going to be broken down in kind of the six major areas.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.500
So one we have our file menu bar.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.339
This is going to be the same throughout a lot of editors that you see inside of Unreal

7
00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.780
Engine 5.

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.780
Two, we have our main toolbar.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.740
This goes across the top here.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.740
Three is our editor viewport.

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.100
So we're going to be spending a lot of our time.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.460
Four is the tabbed drawer system.

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.719
Five is our content browser.

14
00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.280
And then six here, this is going to be our output log and some things for notifications

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.280
for save.

16
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.420
So take a look at each one of these areas in more depth in the editor because it's

17
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.820
kind of important to understand what each one does.

18
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.740
So again, across the top here we have our file, edit, window tools, build selected,

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
actors and help.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.099
So file is going to allow us to access anything that's related to opening or saving a level

21
00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.579
as well as opening up our projects or even zipping up our projects right here should

22
00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.740
be want to share them.

23
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:31.039
It is going to do anything that we have revolving or I should say involving, undo as well as

24
00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.000
our editor preferences and our project settings and plugins.

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.879
So these are important settings right down here.

26
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:41.159
If we ever want to edit any preferences for our editor or a project or disable or enable

27
00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.399
any plugins, we can access those options right here.

28
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.919
Window allows us to access the various level editor windows and other tools that we might

29
00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.039
want to work with.

30
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.460
The cool thing about this is we can open up multiple content browsers or detail panels.

31
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.660
We can also activate things like our layers or our levels or our light mixer should we

32
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.660
want to do that.

33
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.700
One of the other super useful features of the windows tab is this load layout.

34
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.580
You can use this in case you accidentally loaded something inside of Unreal and you weren't

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.180
sure you want to kind of go back.

36
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.259
This is a great way to just quickly get your UI back to its default state.

37
00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:26.379
Now tools allows us to view various tools that we can use to help us do everything from

38
00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:33.679
say merge actors to audit our assets and even set up our device managers and our profiles.

39
00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:39.959
We can also run Python scripts and convert levels to world partition through this menu.

40
00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.439
Build allows us to build either everything by clicking on the build all levels up here

41
00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.120
at the top or it allows us to just build these individual things here.

42
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
We're going to build things like our reflection or pre-computed static visibility.

43
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.000
If we're using HLODs we can build those from this particular menu, landscape and texture

44
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.340
streaming all types of other things can all be done from the build level right here.

45
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.780
Select has to deal with selection.

46
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.340
If I have something selected here and I come to select you can see here I can get a few

47
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.259
options so I can select all.

48
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.599
I'm going to hold down L and click really quick and I'm going to click select again

49
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.159
and you can see here I get some slightly different settings so I can select all relevant lights

50
00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.120
or select all lights or select all stationary lights that exceed overlap.

51
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.439
There's a lot of interesting things I can do here with select.

52
00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.000
Now actor is going to be context sensitive.

53
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.079
That means that if I don't have anything selected actor is not going to show any information

54
00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.639
and with that actor selected it's going to allow me to do a bunch of different things

55
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:52.500
with this particular actor that I have selected such as I can convert this, I could replace

56
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
it with another asset.

57
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.859
There's a ton of things that I can do here including grouping and changing it to pivot

58
00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.859
or attaching it and then last but not least we have help.

59
00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.259
Help is where we're going to view all of the various help so from our viewport controls

60
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:12.339
and level documentation to API references to credits and even our bout or visit you

61
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.079
can find everything that you need for help here in our help menu.

62
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.360
Alright so two is going to be our main toolbar so that's going to cover this area that is

63
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.319
right here so this is going to be our save current level to disk.

64
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.879
Now this doesn't save everything this just saves the current level this browses to the

65
00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.879
current level that's on disk.

66
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:41.759
Selection mode changes the editor's tool set to respect the different thing that you have

67
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.699
selected here and we'll cover these tools later on in this in more detail but note for

68
00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.740
now that selection mode is how we can access some further tools inside of Unreal Engine

69
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.240
5.

70
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.579
Next to that we have quickly add to the project what this does is this allows us to quickly

71
00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:04.180
add things such as lights or shapes or cinematic things to our project that we might need to

72
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.620
work with.

73
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.420
Next to that we have our blueprint this allows us to either add blueprints or open and edit

74
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:18.240
our level blueprint we can also modify our game blueprint and our game mode override here

75
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.439
should be need to from this menu.

76
00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.720
Next to that we have our cinematics cinematics I should say it's called by another name which

77
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.080
is sequencer so if I open this up you can see here I can add a level sequence or add

78
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.639
a level sequence for the shots should I need to use that.

79
00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.480
Next to this we have our PIE or play in editor control so if I just click play right now

80
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.379
it's going to plop me right there but if I click these little ellipses right here you

81
00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.060
can see I have a bunch of different options.

82
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.340
Now the great thing about this is that not only can I simulate or play this game either

83
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.340
in a new viewport or in a standalone game I can also simulate multiplayer by adding

84
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.980
the number of players down here and adjusting the settings I want for multiplayer.

85
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.259
Next to that we have platforms what this does is this allows us to quickly launch our project

86
00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.480
on the various platforms that is selected so for example if we're coming down here to

87
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:19.680
Android we would pick package project and then we'd be able to run that from our Android

88
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.959
devices if we had an Android device plugged in and ready we'd see it right up here at

89
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.079
the top and we could just select it as well to quickly launch on it.

90
00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:31.599
Now the last setting up here is settings and what this settings does is there are some

91
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.680
settings here for things like translucent selection but the main usage of this is going

92
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:42.860
to be for your scalability for our material quality levels and our preview platform overrides.

93
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.019
These allow us to adjust the visual settings of Unreal Engine 5's editor window right here

94
00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:52.740
so that we can get a better idea of what the project is going to look like on say reduced

95
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.540
settings or limited hardware.

96
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.100
Alright so three is our viewport.

97
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.019
This is where you're going to spend 99% of your time inside of Unreal Engine 5.

98
00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.399
This is because the viewport is where we add objects but we also manipulate them, move

99
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:12.560
them around, duplicate them and things of that nature in order to bring us the creations

100
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.399
that you are building with Unreal Engine 5 and you can see here I'm just kind of navigating

101
00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.240
around the viewport.

102
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.000
There are a few options across the top here at the viewport.

103
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.879
On the left hand side we have some options for our viewport then we have the ability

104
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.639
to change our camera.

105
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:34.779
We have the ability to look at various lighting modes and then we have show which will show

106
00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:41.139
us various flags and options such as rendering sprites like this player start or this point

107
00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:42.779
light.

108
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:49.939
Going a little bit further down here we have our select, move, rotate and scale as well

109
00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:55.459
as controls to control the snapping and this last little button right here this controls

110
00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:59.079
our maximize and minimizes the viewport here.

111
00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:04.799
Now next to that we have our outliner and our details panel.

112
00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:07.879
These are Unreal's tab drawer system and the reason I want to bring that up is these can

113
00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:12.799
be just brought up and kind of docked together like that so you're not stuck with this particular

114
00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:18.039
menu but these two outliners and details panels are very important to understand what they

115
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.039
do.

116
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:24.240
So the outliner will outline all of the objects or actors that we have placed inside of our

117
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.980
scene so it's going to show us this and this and this and whatever I have currently selected

118
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.419
the outliner is going to show us that we can also select things inside of the outliner.

119
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.180
Now the details panel that is going to show us the details or the properties of the actor

120
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.340
that we have selected so you can see here when I select a player start I can come down

121
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.820
here and I have a transformation and object and a rendering but when I select a light

122
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.120
you'll notice I have a transformation but I have a light now instead of the other properties

123
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.520
that I had when I had the player start so there we go.

124
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.879
So you can see here the outliner again allows us to look at objects or actors that have

125
00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:11.760
been placed inside of our scene and then the details panel allows us to get more information

126
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.520
or edit its properties.

127
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:18.740
So next we have the content drawer so this is really simply just allows us to access

128
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.100
the content browser you can also access this by hitting control space on the keyboard and

129
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.460
if you like you can press this dock in layout to have that dock right there in the layout

130
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:34.419
for you so that it is constantly up so you can search with it.

131
00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:40.500
Finally we have our output log our command section and what this does is this just allows

132
00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:46.080
us to look at our log should we need to use this for any debug information our CMD here

133
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.600
this allows us to input either commands or Python commands that we need to activate inside

134
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.240
of the editor.

135
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.039
Trace allows us to run memory traces and this is used for advanced debugging on your projects

136
00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:01.480
you need to figure out why your project is performing poorly.

137
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.279
Our derived data cache is used when we are working on a team of multiple people and we

138
00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:13.259
want to have our data load a little more quickly we can use this to help in our data loading.

139
00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:18.899
We then have our map status which is showing us currently this map is unsaved and then

140
00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:24.259
we have our version control or revision control that shows us if we are working with some

141
00:10:24.259 --> 00:10:31.259
form of version control what we are connected to and what changes are currently being applied

142
00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:35.579
or what changes we currently need to make.

143
00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:40.879
That represents the Unreal Engine kind of editor UI.

144
00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:47.879
Now as I was going in the editor I was moving around and to do that there are actually two

145
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.280
different ways we can go about this.

146
00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:00.280
We can use the WAS and D keys and the left or right mouse button so we can use the WAS

147
00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:06.279
and D to move us around or we can use the right mouse button to and this would be commonly

148
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:13.279
referred to as first person controls so it is pretty standard across multiple first person

149
00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:20.279
shooter games where we use WAS and D to move our carat forward backwards left and right.

150
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:26.279
There is another way that we can move throughout the editor we can hold down the right mouse

151
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:34.279
button to drag around the scene from a static POV or we can hold down the middle mouse button

152
00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:36.279
to track up down left and right.

153
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:42.279
Let's just take a look at that again so again we hold down the left mouse button and we

154
00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:47.279
can go like this hold down the right mouse button and we can move we hold them both together

155
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:53.279
and we can move left and right and we hold down the middle mouse button we can also move

156
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.279
up and down.

157
00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:01.279
One of the things that I like to do is just kind of mess with the WAS and D until I get

158
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:06.279
to something and then I use the individual mouse buttons to help kind of focus in what

159
00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.279
it is that I happen to try to be looking at.

160
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:14.279
We can also use Q and E to raise the camera up and down.

161
00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:20.279
Z and C will temporarily allow us to increase or decrease our field of view so we can kind

162
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:26.279
of get a zoom in effect there or see our project in extreme distortion.

163
00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:31.279
If you hold down ALT with something selected you will get an orbit style and you can also

164
00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:38.279
use the middle mouse button to move your camera around similar to how you would do the camera

165
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.279
inside of something like 3D Studio Max or Maya.

166
00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:47.279
Finally if you press the F key this will focus you into something so let's say that maybe

167
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:51.279
you got super zoomed out or something like that you can just simply grab something and

168
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:57.279
hit the F key to focus right in on it.

169
00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:04.279
Now when we are editing objects we have the ability to move, rotate and scale them and

170
00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:11.279
each one of those functionalities is going to be notified by a specific gizmo.

171
00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:17.279
The move gizmo looks like this, our rotation gizmo shows us different axes that we can

172
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:22.279
rotate and our scale looks similar to our move but instead of showing arrows it has these

173
00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:26.279
little handles we can pull to scale in our relative directions.

174
00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:33.279
Each one of our select transform, rotate and scale has some options as well as the ability

175
00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.279
to snap to a grid.

176
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:40.279
The reason we want to snap to a grid is this helps us move things in certain increments

177
00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:46.279
so we can move this every 10 units or we can rotate this every 10 degrees or we can snap

178
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:58.279
this every .25 in scale and this really helps when we are trying to maybe move something

179
00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:01.279
or scale something in a very precise increments.

180
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.279
Let's pop over to the editor and look at that now.

181
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:08.279
So first off I'm just going to grab this ball right here and I'm going to hit F to focus

182
00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:13.279
in on it and then I'm just going to hit the space bar to cycle through my various widgets

183
00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:19.279
and then once I have a widget I want I can again just grab on that axis to do the rotation

184
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:26.279
or the move or I should say the rotation and the scale.

185
00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:28.279
There we go, set it backwards.

186
00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.279
Then I want.

187
00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:34.279
Now if I don't want any of that I can come here and actually do this and you'll see here

188
00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:39.279
that I have a lot more finer control over how I am doing this scaling operation or if

189
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:42.279
I was to come here to my, let's just turn it off for everything.

190
00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:48.279
You can see here now I can move this over ever so slightly as with the grid on I have a little

191
00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.279
bit of a snapping on there and the same thing with our rotation.

192
00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.279
I can rotate this ever so slightly.

193
00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:58.279
You can even see that reflected in the degree operation there that you're seeing at the

194
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:05.279
top of my gizmo it's showing me that I'm going at 14.8, 16 and if I turn this back on we

195
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:11.279
will see that going at every 10 degree increments.

196
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:17.279
Now the last thing that I do want to talk about is a little bit more on PIE because there are

197
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:19.279
some other things that we can do with this.

198
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:27.279
So again PIE stands for play in editor and it can be used to play literally right from the area

199
00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.279
you are navigating.

200
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:42.279
You can also use alt PIE on your keyboard to set this as a shortcut and we use this for a lot of things.

201
00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:44.279
Let me just pop over to the editor really quick.

202
00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:46.279
So first and foremost right click play from here.

203
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:50.279
This is going to be something to use a lot of times and this is really great because it basically

204
00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:53.279
launches you from the area that you clicked on.

205
00:15:53.279 --> 00:16:00.279
So it's going to right click, it's going to select that pixel over there and basically put me as close to that pixel as I can.

206
00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:06.279
The reason this is so good is if I was to hit play, play is always going to start me from over here.

207
00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:11.279
So let's say that I am trying to look at something over here that I'm investigating or something like that.

208
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:17.279
When I hit play I'm going to go all the way over here in order to get there.

209
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:26.279
So that's why this right click play from here is so powerful because it allows me to play right from an area that I need to get to to get information.

210
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:31.279
One of the other things that you can do is we drop down this arrow, there's going to be this simulate.

211
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:36.279
So what simulate does is it runs the game but it doesn't add the player.

212
00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:44.279
So this is really good if we are trying to debug something and we want the game to run but we don't necessarily need the game to give us a player.

213
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:59.279
So we can use simulate to simulate things like the physics thread and once we've done that we can then stop and then do that one more time to run without having to actually get out of the player or navigate to another location.

214
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:05.279
Simulate makes it really really easy to do this right inside of the editor viewport.

215
00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:15.279
So again, Alt S is to simulate and we'll hit escape to stop that and then Alt P is to play the actual game.

216
00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:30.279
And these are going to really help you out especially once you have been play testing or you need to test something throughout further interaction you're going to find that this is a really great way to do that.
