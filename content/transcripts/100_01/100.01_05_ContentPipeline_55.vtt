00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.679
Understanding a few things about how Unreal deals with content is important as this will

2
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.080
ensure that whatever content you're bringing into the engine will function in the way that

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.519
you want without any unforeseen performance issues.

4
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.839
And the first thing we're going to talk about in the content pipeline is the unit of measurement

5
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.359
Unreal uses when dealing with static or skeletal meshes.

6
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.079
Unit 5 uses centimeters for its unit of measurement.

7
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.880
So this means that one Unreal unit equals one centimeter.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.920
It's best to make sure that your digital content creation tools such as 3max, Maya,

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.239
Blender, or whatever tools you happen to use have their system or scene scale set to centimeters.

10
00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.600
This way you can avoid any and all scaling issues from your pipeline.

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.719
The next thing in our content pipeline I'd like to talk about deals with textures.

12
00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.400
Now textures for the best performance should always be a power of 2 in either the X or

13
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.040
the Y axis.

14
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:17.520
This means that they can range from 2 by 16 to 128 by 256 all the way up to 4096 by 8192.

15
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.280
Textures do not have to be square so 64 by 64, 128 by 128 is good but you can also have

16
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.680
128 by 256 or 1024 by 2048.

17
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.640
Textures just need to maintain this power of 2 ratio in the X or the Y axis.

18
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.719
Unreal Engine also supports on import a number of uncompressed and compressed formats.

19
00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.400
So for uncompressed on imports you can bring in BMP, TARGA, and PSD or you can bring in

20
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:53.200
PNG, JPG, DDS, and HDR depending again on what format meets the needs of your project.

21
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.480
When importing content into Unreal there's a couple of different ways we can do this.

22
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.159
You can either drag and drop right from the OS folder or your desktop right into the content

23
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.080
browser or you can click the add button in the content browser and then from there you

24
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.960
have a number of options under get content.

25
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.400
You can also click on the fab icon which will launch the fab browser inside of the editor

26
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.560
allowing you to search for and purchase content for your project.

27
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.560
You can even download content right from within the fab browser inside of the editor

28
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
for anything that you have in your library.
