00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
Understanding how Unreal Engine 5 projects are structured is very important as Unreal

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.960
Engine 5 projects are set up in a slightly different way than you might be used to in

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.759
traditional applications.

4
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.839
This is because in a traditional application, you generally use a single project file to

5
00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.080
visualize your scene.

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.960
So when we're inside a Photoshop and we save, we're going to save it to a .psd.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.039
Or inside of Word when we save, we're going to save to the .doc or the same for Maya if

8
00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.039
we save, we're going to save to the .mb format.

9
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.560
Now Unreal has a slightly different approach to this.

10
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.320
When you're inside of Unreal Engine 5 and you want to import something such as a model,

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.760
a texture, audio, or animations, all of that is going to be stored in the content folder

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.679
and use a .usset file format.

13
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.119
There are two other file formats that we should be aware of.

14
00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.960
The first one is the level file format.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.640
This is called the .umap file format.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000
And this is for any levels that we happen to be saving.

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.280
And levels is a term for what we place actors or our content and we light and it's what

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.719
the end user ends up seeing in your project.

19
00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:27.959
Now if we are creating, say, a material or editing an asset inside of Unreal, whatever

20
00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.640
we're doing inside of there is going to be saved again in the .usset file format.

21
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.519
Again, if we are importing something such as a static mesh or maybe a texture, whatever

22
00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:45.319
we export will be done is, say, a .fbx or a .png.

23
00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.279
And when we bring that into Unreal, that's going to be imported and then saved as this

24
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:55.359
.usset file format.

25
00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.839
Now here is an example of an Unreal Engine project folder.

26
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:05.759
And you'll notice quite a few different folders in here, but don't worry.

27
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.079
A lot of these folders are actually auto-generated and can be deleted in case you need to either

28
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.600
share your project with someone else or you run into an issue and you kind of want to

29
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.880
start fresh.

30
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.040
We can actually do that.

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.360
So let's go ahead and take a look at what these folders are now.

32
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.000
So right down here we have our .uproject.

33
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.080
This is going to associate Unreal Engine to run.

34
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.920
When we click on this, it's going to say, hey, I want you to load Unreal Engine, but I want

35
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.520
you to load the Engine and all of the content that is created inside of this folder right

36
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
here.

37
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.800
Now above that we have the Valley of the Ancients.png.

38
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.480
This is our thumbnail that represents what we'll see inside of the Unreal Engine launcher

39
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.760
that's associated with our project.

40
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
Then we have Source.

41
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.160
So this is going to contain any of our C++ code that we might run custom for this particular

42
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.280
project.

43
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.680
And this is a file that you need to keep, so never delete your source.

44
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.840
Now saved contains saved information and this can be a whole bunch of different things.

45
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.039
One of the things that you'll find in here are, say, screenshots.

46
00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.640
You'll also find crash dumps.

47
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.000
You'll find build data.

48
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.360
One of the things you can do with saved is you can actually delete this folder should

49
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.480
you ever need to just maybe free up some space or something like that.

50
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.080
This is a saved folder to delete.

51
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.719
It will automatically be recreated once your project has been relaunched.

52
00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:37.199
Now your plugins folder contains any plugins that you might have either purchased or created

53
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.439
specifically for this particular project or maybe there are plugins that you have set

54
00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.560
up so that you can share content in between your projects.

55
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.119
The plugins folder is not safe to delete as doing so could actually reduce functionality

56
00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.119
that your project needs.

57
00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.639
So you need to keep that folder at all times.

58
00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:03.120
Your intermediates folder is where things like shader compilation data builds, partially

59
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.759
completed compilations and other things like that are stored.

60
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.319
It's a bunch of just miscellaneous data in here.

61
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.000
This folder can be safely deleted should you be running into any issues as it will automatically

62
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.639
be recreated once the engine has been relaunched.

63
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.600
Your derived data cache is a folder that contains pre-compiled versions of your shaders and this

64
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600
allows the engine to run much, much quicker.

65
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600
I shouldn't say run.

66
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600
I apologize.

67
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.760
It allows it to load much, much quicker.

68
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.879
You can delete your derived data cache but I suggest that you don't as this will greatly

69
00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.439
affect your loading times.

70
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.640
Next is our content.

71
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.040
So the content is where all of our content are .usets and our .umaps files live.

72
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.240
We always need to keep the content folder that's not safe to delete that folder or you'll

73
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.040
be deleting all of the content for your project.

74
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.200
Next we have our config.

75
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.560
The config is where we store all of our config information and this will control how the

76
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.199
editor starts or what settings are used when the game is loaded.

77
00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.360
You should not be deleting the config folder as you need that information for when the

78
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.120
editor starts or when your game launches.

79
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.279
Next we have our build.

80
00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.199
This is where we are going to temporarily store builds that we have done for our project

81
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.120
that is safe to delete your builds folder.

82
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.439
This folder can actually grow quite large so if your project is all of a sudden taking

83
00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.800
up too much space you might want to delete this folder.

84
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.199
It will be recreated when Unreal Engine restarts.

85
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.279
And then last but not least we have our binaries.

86
00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.560
This is going to be created should you have any binaries that you want to have for your

87
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.720
project.

88
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.720
If you don't see this folder that's okay.

89
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:55.120
I believe it was created after the fact but you can delete this folder without any issues.

90
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.519
Now if we dive into one of these folders we're going to look at something like this.

91
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.159
Here we are looking at the attenuation and this is basically notice that there are all

92
00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.240
UAsset files here.

93
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.680
We're just looking at one folder here.

94
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.039
While I am visualizing this inside of Windows Explorer one thing I want to note is that

95
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.639
you should never mess with files outside of Unreal.

96
00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.519
Let's say we did want to take all of these attenuation files and maybe make a new folder

97
00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:31.680
and split half of them or some other organizational thing that we want to do.

98
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.599
We should never ever ever do that outside of Unreal Engine 5.

99
00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.120
We should always do that inside of the editor using the editor renaming and moving functionalities

100
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.839
that are provided in there.

101
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:54.199
Now with all of these great files and everything there can be some bottlenecks.

102
00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:01.680
Traditionally in older versions of Unreal whenever you wanted to make a change to anything

103
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.560
you would need to make that change inside of our UMAP.

104
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.439
Now the problem with this is that the UMAP folder was or should say the UMAP file is

105
00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:18.680
unique and only one person can have it checked out at one time.

106
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.399
This means that whenever I want to make a change to it I either have to wait for somebody

107
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:31.679
else to finish making their changes or come up with a complex way to work on my stuff

108
00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:34.359
and then somehow merge it with theirs later on.

109
00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:42.719
This can create a lot of conflicts especially as teams start to grow in size.

110
00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:49.039
With Unreal Engine 5 we've introduced a new file system called one file per actor which

111
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.080
reduces overlaps between users and does this by saving data for instance the vectors in

112
00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:01.120
external files and this actually removes the need to save everything to the UMAP file.

113
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.840
So instead of everything being saved to the UMAP file it's now linked to the UMAP file

114
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.280
and this will allow multiple people to be working in the same world all adding and adjusting

115
00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:18.799
things without worrying about whether or not somebody has something checked in or checked

116
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:19.799
out.

117
00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:24.199
Now just a couple of things to note about one file per actor.

118
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:29.639
It is recommended that you do use Unreal Engine 5 source control when you enable this because

119
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:36.720
it is going to involve a lot more files than you might be used to because remember we're

120
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.000
going to be making a file for pretty much everything that you see that's placed inside

121
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.980
of the level.

122
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.399
With that said you should also be utilizing the built in editor check in and check out

123
00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:59.759
tools to help check your data in, check your data out and last but not least remember that

124
00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:08.019
using one file per actor is meant to work in tandem with world partition so using it

125
00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:18.159
outside of this system might result in some unintended uses or unforeseen edge cases so

126
00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.100
just be on the lookout for that.
