00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
Unreal Engine 5's foliage tool can be used to paint mass amounts of static meshes across

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.200
your scene.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.919
This tool will work on landscapes, static meshes, BSPs, transparent surfaces, and even

4
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.480
other foliage meshes.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.160
That's right, you can get some foliage inception by painting your foliage on top of foliage.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.560
Let's take a look at how this tool works by popping over to the editor now.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.359
So for this tool to work, what we need to do first is come up to our selection and go

8
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.359
down to foliage.

9
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.759
And this is going to activate the tool.

10
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.000
Now across the top here we have our select all these select, select and valid, lasso,

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.840
paint, reapply, single fill, erase, remove, and move.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.439
Out of all of these tools, the ones that you're probably going to be using the most are going

13
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.759
to be select.

14
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:52.239
What this does is this actually allows you to select individual foliage actors and then

15
00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.320
adjust their properties.

16
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.480
The next one is going to be paint, as paint allows us to paint.

17
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.559
So let's go ahead and add something to this to see how this tool works.

18
00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.840
So hitting control space, I have my static meshes selected.

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.439
I'm just going to grab this basic asset two and drop it right in there.

20
00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.120
With that selected now, you're going to see there is my foliage brush.

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.159
And if I just left click, look at that.

22
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.319
So a couple of things that we can adjust here across the top, we have our brush size, which

23
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.319
allows us to increase the size of our brush.

24
00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.839
Our paint density allows us to increase the density that things are going to be painted

25
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.839
at. I'm going to set that back to 0.5.

26
00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:34.000
And then our erase density does the same thing.

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It allows us to increase the density of the erase.

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.039
You can see here when I hold shift, that's how I'm actually erasing things right there.

29
00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.359
Further on down here, what we have is the individual settings for our foliage actor.

30
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.119
So the painting controls how this is going to look when it is painted.

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.560
So we have our density here, which decreasing this, setting this to like one is going to

32
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.200
give us fewer.

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.320
And then setting this to something really high is going to give us a whole lot of them.

34
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.680
Radius is a really cool option.

35
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.439
So what radius does is it defines the minimum distance between the foliage actors so that

36
00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.640
they don't collide with one another.

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.879
One way to figure out this number is if you double click on your static mesh here, and

38
00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.439
under the approximate size, if you look at this middle number 104, we're going to close

39
00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.439
that.

40
00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.800
We're going to set our radius here to 104.

41
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.199
And this is a great way to figure out what a good size is going to be for your particular

42
00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.840
mesh so that things do not intersect.

43
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.240
You can also use the bracket keys on your keyboard to make the brush smaller or larger.

44
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.000
And you can do this with actually all of the editors like the landscape editor.

45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.800
If you need to adjust the size of your brush, we can also adjust the min and the max.

46
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800
So set that to two.

47
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.200
One of the other things that we can do here under our placement is we have the ability

48
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.020
to adjust how our normals are, how this object is aligned to the normals of a surface.

49
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.040
And then we can even set things like the ground slope angle so that, for example, we could

50
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
have maybe a certain mesh that we want to use that can only be selector.

51
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.159
Maybe it only grows on a certain angle so that when we paint this particular thing across

52
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.799
our landscape, it will only go on areas that meet this particular criteria.

53
00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.479
We can get actually very advanced in particular with the restrictions that we make with this

54
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.400
tool.

55
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.719
Underneath the instance settings, this is going to control how this reacts to things

56
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.639
like lighting and collision, which I highly recommend.

57
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.159
You do not put collision on your foliage objects.

58
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.359
It is just going to cause you problems.

59
00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.879
We have a physics which will allow us to override our physical materials and scalability in

60
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.079
drawing in the virtual texture.

61
00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.479
One of the other things that we can do with this tool is notice that there's a little

62
00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.240
save icon right here.

63
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.599
We could actually save these settings to a specific thing called a foliage asset, which

64
00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.560
will make it a lot easier when we need to apply this foliage to another level or we want

65
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.599
to use it in some other instance.

66
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.360
Now one of the other things that I want to show you here, let's click on select.

67
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.639
If I click select here, notice that I can select them.

68
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.600
If I hit the space bar, I can rotate it, I can scale it, and I can also delete it.

69
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.439
This is really great if you happen to paint a bunch of foliage and you realize it's going

70
00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.000
through say a building or something, you can come in here and select or we could do like

71
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.600
a lasso selection and select a bunch of them and just remove the ones that happen to be

72
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.839
intersecting.

73
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.879
The other thing that I want to show you, and this will be the last one for this, is reapply.

74
00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.639
What reapply does, let me just come here to paint really quick and let's paint a bunch

75
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.719
in here.

76
00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:56.560
What reapply does is it allows you to reapply a setting without actually having to erase

77
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.000
everything and reapply everything manually.

78
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.719
What reapply does is if we come here and we go to, I don't know, placement, let's just

79
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.320
say like negative 50 by negative 125 and we'll just do like that.

80
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.440
That's probably a little bit too much.

81
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.720
So zero, the maximum could be like negative 50 and the minimum could be, for some reason

82
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
they're like linked.

83
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.320
I don't know what's up with that, but there we go.

84
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320
Something like that.

85
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.240
So what this is doing is it's allowing us and we decide, you know what, I don't actually

86
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240
want that at all.

87
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.880
So I want them to go back to the way that they were.

88
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
So there we go.

89
00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.159
Now I've reapplied that particular setting without actually having to remove them.

90
00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.719
So if we're really happy with our foliage, we can come in here to the reapply and just

91
00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.839
adjust the parameter that we want.

92
00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.279
We're also not limited to just one single foliage type.

93
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.719
I can do a bunch of different things.

94
00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:58.319
Let me just come out here and not sure why they're not showing up for me.

95
00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.839
Oh, because I'm in reapply.

96
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.560
Let me come over here to paint.

97
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.560
There we go.

98
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.160
That's the beginning, all of those individual little things sitting out here.

99
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160
So there we go.

100
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.920
All right, so that's the foliage tool.
