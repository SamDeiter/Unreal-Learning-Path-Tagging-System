00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Sequencer is Unreal Engine 5's editor for creating and editing linear animations, but

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400
it can also be used for so much more than that.

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.600
You can actually use Sequencer for gameplay events to help you generate movies or promotional

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
items.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.920
It can be used pretty much like an offline renderer or in a real time capacity.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.440
Let's pop into the editor now and see more about how this tool works.

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.800
First off, to create and work with Sequencer, we need to create something called a level

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
sequence.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
To do that, there's a number of different ways.

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.480
We can right-click inside of here and we can come down to our, I believe it is under

11
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.600
Cinematics, we can create a level sequence or animation sequence or a template sequence,

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.280
we can come up here to the sequences up here and we can either add a level sequence or

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.480
add a level sequence with a shots track.

14
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.159
The difference between them is this.

15
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.640
A level sequence will allow us to have one shot, but a level sequence with a shots track

16
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.840
will allow us to have a level sequence with multiple cameras inside of it.

17
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.400
Let's say that we know we're going to be using five or six cameras because we have five or

18
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.080
six camera cuts.

19
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.840
Instead of setting those all up for us one by one, we can click the add level sequence

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.200
with shots to have those five shots already created for us.

21
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000
For now though, I'm just going to select this add level sequence and we're going to call

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.320
this LS underscore example.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.280
When I do that, you're going to notice something a little bit different happens.

24
00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.040
All of a sudden the sequence opens up and if I hit control space, we can see it's right

25
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
there.

26
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.400
We can close sequencer just by hitting that X and then open it anytime by just clicking

27
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.719
on the sequence to open it up.

28
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:10.360
One of the cool things about sequencer is we can add transforms or rotations or pretty

29
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.400
much anything that we want just as long as we see one of these little key frame.

30
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.960
Key property can actually be key framed if it has one of those little diamonds next to

31
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960
it.

32
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.280
Let's just take a quick look at the editor itself.

33
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.560
Across the top here, we're going to have our main toolbar.

34
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.840
This is our actors that we want to put in here.

35
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.879
There's our save, there's our browse.

36
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.120
This creates a new camera and sets it to the new camera cut.

37
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.640
This allows us to render things out if we want to take a pre-rendered video or something

38
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.120
like that.

39
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.520
This opens up our blueprints, these are our actions and there's a whole bunch of different

40
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520
things inside of here.

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.360
These are our view options, we have our playback options and then our key frame and our snapping

42
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.080
as well as our playback speed and our curve editor.

43
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.200
Now, to add something to sequence, what you can do is select it inside the viewport and

44
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.560
then come here to add and you can add, like we can add the new logo, we can look for it

45
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.360
or we can add selected from the content browser.

46
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.400
For me, I'm just going to add this new UEE logo and you can see as soon as I do that,

47
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.520
it adds a track.

48
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.280
This works just the same as any linear based editor.

49
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.080
We put down key frames and then we move this over like this and then we maybe go like that

50
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.360
and you can see here it's automatically actually going to make that key frame motion for me.

51
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.040
There we go.

52
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.360
To work with one of these properties, it's the same way.

53
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.880
Let's come up here to our, maybe we'll do our transform.

54
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:57.000
We'll do something like, I don't know, add a key frame

55
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.079
and actually it's in auto mode so I don't even need to add one but you can see here it's

56
00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.479
doing that.

57
00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.439
We can also take multiple objects.

58
00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.840
So let me just come here and we're going to go add a point light.

59
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840
There we go.

60
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.960
Where is that?

61
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.920
Let's hit G so we can kind of see where that is.

62
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
There we go.

63
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.720
So let's just add that, add a sequencer, add our point light.

64
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.720
There we go.

65
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.879
And then we can do something like our intensity is set to 8 but we come here, maybe we set

66
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.040
it to like 80.

67
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.879
So you know, maybe we set it back to 8.

68
00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.480
There we go.

69
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.519
So it's kind of like making a little, let's move this a little bit closer to the ground.

70
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.519
There we go.

71
00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:47.159
There we go, something like that.

72
00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.759
So just showing you can have multiple different actors in the same sequence all going off.

73
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.959
Now to actually play this sequence inside of your project, you will need to set up a

74
00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:04.639
little bit of blueprint logic just to fire off the sequence when the level plays.

75
00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:13.560
But other than that, sequences are a fantastic way to create any type of interactive cinematic

76
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.599
or content or linear based content that you wish and have it rendered all in real time,

77
00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.839
output to video and it can really cut down on production times, especially again if you're

78
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.319
using this for any type of linear based media.
