00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
The Epic Games Launcher is a powerful piece of software that's used for managing and downloading

2
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.160
various versions of Unreal Engine as well as content that you've associated with those

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.300
versions of the Engine.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.000
When you open up the Launcher, you're going to be greeted with something that looks like

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.120
this.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.859
And no matter what you're using Unreal Engine for, you'll need to utilize the Launcher in

7
00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:25.859
some way.

8
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.760
Let's take a look at the Launcher now.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.280
So across the top we have our News, Sample, Fab, Library, Twinmotion, and Reality Capture.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.400
News is where we're going to get the latest and greatest news about Unreal Engine, such

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.079
as new releases and anything that's happening in the community you might want to check out.

12
00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.000
Samples are going to take us to any of the Unreal Engine sample content that you can

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.359
download and take apart to see how it was created so you can learn more about how Unreal

14
00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.380
Engine works and help you with whatever project you happen to be building.

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:07.640
Fab takes us to the Start Exploring, which will bring us to the web version of Fab.

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.000
Our library allows us to at the top browse different versions as well as add versions

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.319
of Unreal that we might currently need to use or currently have installed.

18
00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.759
For that we'll find my projects which show all the projects we have installed or created

19
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.199
for this particular computer.

20
00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:30.280
And then underneath that we're going to have our Fab library, which shows us all of the

21
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.239
things we've collected from Fab that we can add or install for our particular engine or

22
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.319
to our project.

23
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:45.000
Now Twinmotion is, I like to refer to it as PowerPoint for 3D, and you can install that

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.560
by coming over to the Twinmotion category.

25
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.920
This is a great way for real-time visualization.

26
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.960
It's very, very simple to use.

27
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.400
And next to that we have Reality Capture.

28
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.400
Reality Capture is the desktop photogrammetry solution that Epic Games provides if you need

29
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.680
to process photogrammetry locally.

30
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.640
Now no matter what you're using Unreal Engine for, you're going to need to utilize the Epic

31
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.319
Games launcher in some way, shape, or form.

32
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.840
So just keep that in mind.

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.879
And I encourage you to explore especially the samples and the Fab section because there's

34
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.280
some really awesome and great stuff out there.

35
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.280
And the Epic Games launcher provides you a great way to access that content.
