00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
Unreal Engine 5's Blueprint Editor is one of its most powerful tools as this allows

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.820
you to create C++ code without actually having to write or know that much about C++ code.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.679
This is achieved by laying down various nodes and then connecting them in a flowchart-like

4
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:30.560
manner in order to construct game logic or interactivity.

5
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.719
Blueprints can be simple assets that just contain a mesh or a light, or they can be

6
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:46.280
very complex and even have the ability to call other blueprints within blueprints.

7
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.200
Let's pop over to the editor now and just take a look at these briefly to get a better

8
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.040
understanding of what we're working with here.

9
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.480
I'm going to hit Control Space on my keyboard and then I'm going to make sure that I have

10
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.200
my Blueprint classes here.

11
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.719
These are all the various blueprints that are in this particular project.

12
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.200
For example, I can pull out this Blueprint ceiling light here and let me just pull this

13
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400
up and we can see here that this is a light.

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.920
If I come over here, you can see I have a brightness and I have a color property here

15
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.200
that I can adjust and I have a source radius.

16
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.120
Now, I'm going to select this and I'm going to hit Control E on my keyboard and that's

17
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.719
going to open up the Blueprint Editor.

18
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.200
This is our Blueprint Editor.

19
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.079
The Blueprint Editor has three main parts.

20
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.359
There's a viewport which represents our visual part.

21
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.600
If our Blueprint needs to have some type of visual component, our viewport is where we

22
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.560
position it and make sure that everything is the way we want it to look.

23
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.120
Then we have the Event Graph and the Construction Script.

24
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.439
The Event Graph is functional when we press play.

25
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.200
When I press the play button right here, things that happen inside of the Event Graph will

26
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.800
fire off.

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.600
The Construction Script, on the other hand, this works when I'm inside of the Editor.

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.800
The Construction Script, when I go ahead and set something like the brightness here, notice

29
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.480
that the Construction Script is firing off.

30
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.920
That's again because we're telling that Construction Script to change the brightness and we do that

31
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.679
inside of our Event Graph.

32
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.599
As I come through here, we're going to have a bunch of different things that I can do.

33
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.279
Here's another Blueprint for Echo.

34
00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.719
This will take just a second.

35
00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.119
I think it hasn't been compiled.

36
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:37.279
Give us just a second here.

37
00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.279
Did I lose it?

38
00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.719
I'll just bring it right there.

39
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.719
There we go.

40
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.520
Here is our Echo.

41
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.560
If I was to hit Ctrl E on this, we're going to notice a much more complicated Blueprint

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
here.

43
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.800
We're going to take a look at the Open.

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.000
It looks like I actually opened up the demo display.

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Let me close that.

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.199
I meant to grab her and hit Ctrl E. There we go.

47
00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.240
Here's her Construction Script.

48
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240
It's setting up her hair.

49
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.159
It looks like here's the Event Graph.

50
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.479
It looks like it's doing some stuff with the hair.

51
00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.639
Here's our viewport.

52
00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.199
Then over here, we have our components, which contain different things like there's stuff

53
00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.199
for her hair.

54
00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.919
A lot of stuff around her hair on this.

55
00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.799
Again, the Blueprint Editor is a super, super powerful tool that allows anybody, whether

56
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.199
they be a level designer, a technical artist, regular artist, or even just a regular designer,

57
00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:37.279
the ability to block out code or experiment in ways that just haven't been possible before.
