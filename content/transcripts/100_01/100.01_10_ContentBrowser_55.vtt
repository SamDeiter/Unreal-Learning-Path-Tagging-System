00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
The Content Browser is an extremely powerful tool for managing all of the content that

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.279
you'll find in any of your Unreal Engine 5 projects.

3
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.379
Not only can you use the Content Browser to import content and manage content, you can

4
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.179
also do advanced searches as well as get detailed information about your assets right from within

5
00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.679
the Content Browser itself.

6
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.920
So let's go ahead and pop over to the Engine and take a look at this in more detail.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.440
Now to access the Content Browser there's two different ways.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.800
We can come down here and go to the Content drawer which is going to open it up and if

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.840
you don't want to keep doing that you can press this dock in layout which is actually

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.359
going to dock this right here.

11
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.439
The other way we can do this is by hitting Control Space and that is going to bring up

12
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.040
this Content Browser and the active window that we have.

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
For now I'm just going to click on this dock in layout so that we can look at this in

14
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.880
a little more detail.

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.280
So over here on the left hand side we have our add.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.560
This is where we're going to do things like import or add features or content packs or

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.719
add things from Quixel or Fab.

18
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.240
We can also create new folders and then you're going to see a bunch of different things here

19
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.180
for creating basic assets.

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.840
Now whenever we want to create something inside of Unreal like a Blueprint or a Material we

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.560
do that by either coming here and looking for the appropriate one up here and then create

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.960
basic assets or if we need something a little bit more advanced under the Create Advanced

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.760
Assets you're going to see a lot of different options down here so what you see is not up

24
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.840
here it's probably down here.

25
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.320
The other way we can do this also is just by right clicking inside of the Content Browser

26
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.240
will access the same menu.

27
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.599
We then have a Favorites which allows us to favorite certain assets that we use quite

28
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:48.359
a bit and then we have our folder structure that allows us to look at all of the folders

29
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.280
that we have and we can also right click in here and do something like a new folder or

30
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.980
should we want to do something like that.

31
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.920
As we go a little bit further on we have our import which allows us to import save all.

32
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.799
This is going to save everything that you have edited inside of the Content Browser

33
00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.159
but it does not save your level so if we want to save our level we click here this saves

34
00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.159
the level.

35
00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.560
This will save actually all the modified assets.

36
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.000
We then have a little navigation here and this is a menu bar that lets us know where

37
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.400
we're currently at in the folder structure.

38
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.840
Then we have our settings so our settings are pretty cool because they allow us to do

39
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.340
a couple of different things.

40
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.960
First off under the View Type we can change this to things like Lists or Columns and the

41
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.280
cool thing about this is let's just find some stuff here.

42
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.159
When we're at Columns you can see here what I get is a bunch of different information and

43
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.159
this is really cool because this can help me make better decisions about what I am currently

44
00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.199
looking at in terms of maybe some optimization.

45
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.800
Here we go if I click on the cloth one I can sort these by my vertices or triangles to

46
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.120
get a better idea of what is going on with them.

47
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.280
I'm going to click this back over to tiles and I'm also going to come over here now

48
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.919
and I want to show you this show engine content.

49
00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.759
I'm going to click that on and what that's going to do is you're not going to see anything

50
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.879
really different but we are going to get our engine folder here and you might need to enable

51
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.439
this.

52
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.319
Sometimes if you want to access stuff that's inside of a plugin or maybe you need to access

53
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.319
some content inside of the engine to make something that is always loading or something

54
00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.319
like that.

55
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.439
That's how you can actually see that by coming up here again and doing this show engine content.

56
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.199
If not then you won't be able to see that.

57
00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.599
A couple of other things to note here.

58
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.879
Thumbnail size, thumbnail edit mode and real time thumbnails.

59
00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.120
These are great if you are trying to.

60
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.360
Let me just click back here and go to this right here.

61
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.159
If I go to my thumbnail edit mode I can drag this thumbnail around.

62
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.159
I wasn't on the thumbnail.

63
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.159
There we go.

64
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.640
I can drag this around and move it and then when I'm done here I can just press done editing

65
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.960
and that will save those changes.

66
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.879
If I ever need to adjust this.

67
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.719
Unreal does a really great job of giving you thumbnails automatically so you might not

68
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.159
need to do that but in case you do that option is there.

69
00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.480
There is also an extremely powerful search and filter.

70
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.480
I'm just going to reset the filters really quick.

71
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.120
If you want to search we have very powerful so I can do underscore N or let me just click

72
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.639
on the content folder right here and we'll do something like dirt.

73
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.639
There we go.

74
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.720
There's the only dirt that I have right there.

75
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.439
It looks like it's only in the content examples.

76
00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.160
One of the other cool things that we can do with the search and I'm just going to paste

77
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:52.660
this into here is we can make these very complex operands to check for items of certain sizes

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.660
or certain properties.

79
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.399
In this example what I'm doing here is I'm looking for triangles less than or equal to

80
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.399
10,500.

81
00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:10.319
Files that are going to have more than 10,500 triangles that's what I'm looking for and

82
00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.279
this will spit them all out for me.

83
00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.560
The search is extraordinarily powerful.

84
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.000
The other thing is the filter.

85
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.279
If we click on this little arrow right here we get a list of filters.

86
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:28.399
I generally run with my textures and my static meshes on probably my materials and maybe

87
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:34.039
my material instances but our filters allow us to filter by whatever we have and then

88
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.879
we can do something like let's look for underscore N, maybe check out all of the normal maps that

89
00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.879
we have.

90
00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.399
Again, very, very powerful features inside of the content browser and something that

91
00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.839
you're going to be utilizing quite a bit inside of your project especially as everything

92
00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.639
that you want to import is going to be imported into here and everything that you want to

93
00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:02.800
create in the editor is going to be created from the content browser menu and then utilized

94
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.360
as you need.
