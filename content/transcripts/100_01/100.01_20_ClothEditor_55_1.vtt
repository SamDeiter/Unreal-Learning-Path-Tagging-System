00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The clothing tools that Unreal Engine 5 provides are actually inside of the animation tools,

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
particularly when you open up a Skeletal Mesh, there is an Activate and Deactivate Clothing Paint,

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which allows you access to Unreal's cloth system.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, Unreal Engine uses the Chaos Cloth Solver, which is a low-level clothing solver responsible for the particle simulation that runs clothing.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This clothing solver allows integrations to be lightweight and is very extensible because we now have direct access to the simulation data.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Unreal's clothing tools are cross-platform enabled, and let's take a look at those tools in the editor now.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
To access the tools, I do need to bring up a Skeletal Mesh, so I'm going to hit Control Space on the keyboard, and then click on Skeletal Meshes.

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Inside the content examples, we do have a couple of clothing examples, so I'm just going to click one and open it up.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, once I have the Skeletal Mesh editor open, if I click on Activate Clothing Paint, this is where I will get the tools.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Once I click on this, you can see here I then have the ability to paint on this surface, and if we right-click on this and go to Set Target,

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.000
you can see here I have a bunch of different options for different settings for clothing circumstances, such as how the clothing will react when it teleports away from the user,

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
whether or not it should react to lift if it has drag and things like that.

13
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There are also a number of different settings down inside of the tool under Cloth Can Figs.

14
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We can adjust things like our mass or our density, as well as how this reacts to collision.

15
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Justing the brush is actually done inside of the tool.

16
00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Down here at the bottom, we have this Clothing Tool, and we can click on this and change a brush, gradient, smooth, or fill, and then we can simply paint as we are used to.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Once we're done with this, we just need to simply close this and try that one more time.

18
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There we go, and we will see the results there in real time in the editor.
