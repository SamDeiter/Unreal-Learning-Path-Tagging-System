00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Unreal Engine 5 Animation Mode is a mode that exposes new tools, panels, and editor behaviors

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.200
that assist with animation workflows.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.839
This essentially turns Unreal Engine into a toolkit for making or editing animations.

4
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.359
When using this mode and animating with something like Control Rig, it's going to offer a more

5
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.960
animation focused editor experience by exposing tabs that aid with the selecting of controls,

6
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.299
transform displays, and launching of tools related to animation.

7
00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:40.259
Animation mode is mainly dependent on using Control Rig within Sequencer.

8
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:45.359
Therefore, a basic knowledge of Sequencer is required to get the most out of this.

9
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.560
Now, normally we would pop right into a demo of us utilizing this, but because this is

10
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.160
a tool that exposes more tools, I'll show you how to activate it, but we don't have a lot of

11
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.359
example content because that is very dependent on what you are doing with this particular tool set.

12
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.659
So let's just pop over here into the editor.

13
00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.159
Now, I am in a bit of a different example here.

14
00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.260
I am in the FK example here for Control Rig, and the reason I want to do that is I do want to have at least

15
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.960
something to populate in the windows when I select the tool set.

16
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.759
So if I come down here to my selection mode and come to Animation, we can see here that under my constraints,

17
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.759
you can see that I have two undefined ones right here that are representative of this right here.

18
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.659
The other tools that I have here are things for poses, tweens, snappers, trails, animation layers,

19
00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.459
and temporarily adjusting pivots, but notice that I also have my animation, Outliner animation details as well.

20
00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.759
So again, this is not necessarily a tool that does one specific thing.

21
00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:57.759
What this mode does is it adjusts the way the editor interacts, giving you a more animation focused workflow.
