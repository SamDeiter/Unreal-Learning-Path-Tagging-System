1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
Unreal Engine 5 is a massive toolset and knowing where the documentation lies can be helpful

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.200
when looking for more information on how to use a particular feature or toolset.

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.480
The Unreal Engine 5 documentation pages are quite robust and they also cover various versions

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.120
of the engine, not just the latest and greatest, but previous versions as well.

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.280
If we were to pop over to our documentation, and here it is right here in a web page, we

6
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.039
can see here these are the various versions.

7
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.240
We go from 5.5 all the way down to 4.27.

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.740
We have the ability to also look at forums, there's documentation, there is learning samples

9
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.240
and there are snippets.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520
Snippets are kind of cool.

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.880
There are code repositories kind of showing us how to do certain things inside of Unreal

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.600
Engine 5.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.680
Learning is going to show us our various learning.

14
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.439
If we ever want to learn about something specifically, we can search for tutorials through here.

15
00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:04.159
Our documentation is going to be our documentation and this is going to be split up into various

16
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.120
higher level areas such as programming and scripting.

17
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.039
Then when we click on these, we're going to be able to go down and get into some more

18
00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.760
details about each one of these.

19
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.039
Then the Unreal forums right here, this is going to offer us interactivity between developers

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.640
and people on the web as well as just getting help from your fellow Unreal Engine 5 developers.

21
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.400
Again, the Unreal Engine documentation isn't just the documentation but is a collection

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.640
of various resources that you can use to find out more about the engine.

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.520
I highly recommend that everybody go out there and check this resource out as it is going

24
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520
to help you figure something out no matter what type of project you're building inside

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.719
of Unreal Engine 5.
