00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The Landscape Tools Unreal Engine provides allow you to modify your landscapes right inside of the editor and can be used to create landscapes of any size.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go ahead and take a look at how we use this tool in the editor now.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So from this blank menu, I'm going to come up here to my selection mode and go down to Landscape.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is going to open up our Landscape tool. The Landscape tool is set up into three different kind of sub-tools.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There is the Manage mode, which helps us manage the size, location, and scale of our landscapes.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So right now what I'm going to do is set this to 31 by 31 and hit Create.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now once I do that, you're going to see that my landscape is added to the world and then my tool is set to Sculpt.

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And Sculpt allows us to actually sculpt our landscape.

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
As you can see here, I can use the various tools to affect the look of our landscape.

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We also have the ability to change the brush size and its fall-off as well as its strength to help us further refine the look and the feel of the landscape.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Over on Paint, you have the ability to actually paint the surface of the landscape.

12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now this current material landscape has on it automatically adjust its look based on the slope of the landscape.

13
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But if we wanted to paint individual layers that represent grass, rocks, and things of that nature, we could do that right on the surface here using the Paint tool.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The Manage mode of our landscape actually allows us, if we come here to our Import, we can actually export this as a height map.

15
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So that we can export or import a height map that was made in a third-party program into Unreal so that we can use that as a basis to work on.

16
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Or we can export it out into another application to tidy up a little bit and then bring that back into Unreal Engine 5.

17
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now the landscape does have a few limitations that you should be made aware of.

18
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
For example, the landscape's tessellation is at the maximum amount that it can be.

19
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So if we come in here and we look at this from the Wireframe mode, a landscape can never get more dense than it currently is.

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I do believe the current is 1 meter per centimeter.

21
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You can enable Nanite on your landscape.

22
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And if you're dealing with a massive open world, I highly recommend that you do this so that you get the performance of Nanite on your landscape.

23
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
To do this, all you need to do is select your landscape and then come down to our Nanite and then just enable the Nanite settings and then build your data.

24
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Once you do that, you will then have a landscape.

25
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And if we come over here real quick, we can actually see some of that Nanite tessellation on this right there.

26
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So there's some of that Nanite tessellation coming through.

27
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And if we come here to our Lit and our Nanite visualization and go Overview, you can see here we are using Nanite on our terrain.

28
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So that's how we are getting some of this cool offset.

29
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But just go back to Lit mode and I'm going to go over to our Wireframe.

30
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It is not actually, you know, again, increasing the regular tessellation of our landscape.

31
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's just increasing the visual density of it, giving us this look.

32
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So remember that we can't actually increase the tessellation of our landscape.

33
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.000
If we want something to have some more detail, we're either going to need to add static meshes or work with displacement and Nanite tessellation in order to get that look that we're going for.
