00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
The Unreal Engine project browser can be used to help you create projects as well as browse

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.060
recent projects that you have opened on your local computer.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.140
From this tool, we can create a number of projects based on Epic Provided Templates or select

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.699
the Blank template.

5
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.780
Let's go ahead and take a look at how we can use this tool and the editor.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.500
We can access this tool and the editor a number of different ways.

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.759
First off, we can go up here to File and we have the new project and the open project.

8
00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.100
The open project, what this is going to do is this is going to allow us to open any projects

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.359
that we currently have on our computer.

10
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.679
Come up here to File and New Projects.

11
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.920
This is where we're going to get access to the project wizard, which allows us to select

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.679
a number of different templates provided by Epic.

13
00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.679
One of the things to note here under the project defaults, if you're unaware, a project can

14
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.039
be either based on Blueprint code, which is the default, or C++.

15
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.159
If you do select C++, you will need to have Visual Studio or some other type of compiler

16
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.120
installed so that you can compile the required files.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120
Underneath that, we have our target platform.

18
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.000
We can change this to desktop or mobile.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
You might want to change this if you know you are targeting a mobile or a lower end device

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.240
or keep it at desktop if you know that you are targeting a desktop or a console.

21
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.960
Quality preset allows us to set this to maximum.

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.000
The defaults are scalable.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920
Scalable would be set in tandem if you were to set this to mobile, so you want to start

24
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.080
with as few options as possible and then through testing, enable options as you have performance

25
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080
to do that.

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.600
Last but not least, we have the starter content.

27
00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:51.640
The starter content is a collection of content that can be used to help you quickly get up

28
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.799
and started with prototyping inside of the engine.

29
00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.159
You do have the ability to also specify your project's location and the name of the project.

30
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.199
Once you have everything set, you simply hit Create and your new project will be created

31
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.199
and loaded right inside of the editor.
