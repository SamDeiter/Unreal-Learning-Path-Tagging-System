Unreal Engine 5's Mesh Paint mode allows you to paint on your static meshes, both vertex colors,

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.599
vertex weights, textures, and even allows you to blend in between two different materials

3
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.600
should you want to do that. Let's pop into the editor and take a brief look at how we use this

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.960
tool now. So before I access the tool, I am going to add myself here a sphere, and this is just

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.359
going to give me something to demonstrate the tool with. It's not needed to use the tool, but is

6
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.039
needed for demonstration. So with that added, there we go. I'm going to come up here to activate

7
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.799
the tool by coming down to our selection mode and then going to Mesh Paint. And looks like right

8
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.679
there I have that selected. So across the top we have our vertex color, our vertex weights, our

9
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.880
texture color, and our texture. So textures is going to require a unique setup. It's a little bit

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.840
outside the scope of this demo, but let's demonstrate the vertex color. So to do this, all we need

11
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.840
to do is click on the paint here, and then we can just start to paint. And you can see here I'm

12
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.840
painting right in the vertex color information. I can change this to like red. You can tell this

13
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.159
is vertex color because we can see it putting color in between the vertices and we're getting kind

14
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.240
of these little gradients that you see right there. You can also see it snapping to each of the

15
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.840
individual vertices there. But very, very powerful tool. Another thing that we have the ability to

16
00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm going to come over here to our texture color. If I click on this add right here, check this out.

17
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.159
If I come over here to paint, now I have the ability to actually paint right here on this. And I can

18
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.680
do things like fill, paint different colors, or I can swap my colors here and do all types of

19
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.920
interesting things. And again, I'm doing this all right inside of the editor. So very, very powerful

20
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.920
tool and worth doing some investigating into seeing how this can affect your workflow as,

21
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.000
again, you're working right inside of the editor and it is a super powerful tool to use.
