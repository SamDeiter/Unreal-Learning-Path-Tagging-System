00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
Unreal Motion Graphics, or UMG for short, is Unreal Engine 5's tool for creating user

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.060
interfaces.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.660
Unlike some of Unreal Engine's other tools, this tool actually features two tools in one.

4
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.400
UMG contains a designer and a graph, and the designer is responsible for designing the

5
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:29.500
look and feel of your UI, while the graph is responsible for the functionality of your

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
UI.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Let's go ahead and pop over to the Engine now and take a look at this in more detail.

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.200
So first off, we need to actually create a user interface blueprint.

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.359
So to do that, we're going to hit Control Space, and then from the Content Browser,

10
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.599
we're going to right-click, and underneath User Interfaces, we're going to look for a

11
00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:49.820
Widget Blueprint.

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.340
Now when we do that, we are going to be asked to pick parent class, and what we're going

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.820
to do is from Common, we're just going to select a user widget.

14
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.780
I'm going to call this Widget Blueprint underscore example.

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.460
Now let's double-click on this to open it up, and when we do, it's going to open it up

16
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.219
in the UMG Editor with the Designer tab open.

17
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.140
Now remember, there is a designer and there is a graph, so the designer is how we're going

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.939
to make this UMG look, and the graph is how we're going to make this UMG functional.

19
00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.980
So let's take a look at the Designer tab first, and then we will go over to the Graph tab.

20
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.579
So across the top, though, we have our File, Edit, Asset, View, Debug, Window, Tools, and

21
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.939
Help, much like we have in all of our other editors.

22
00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.219
Then we have our main toolbar, and this is actually going to look pretty similar to the

23
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.939
main toolbar inside of Blueprints.

24
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.859
We have Save and Browse to this asset in the Content Browser.

25
00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.060
We have our Compile.

26
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
We also have a Diff.

27
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.819
What this does is, if we're using Source Control, this allows us to compare two different Widget

28
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.260
Blueprints to see why they are different or what was changed or if something's broken,

29
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.659
we can see what happened and why it became broken.

30
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.420
This here allows us to start a play in our active viewport if we're trying to debug our

31
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.060
UI, and we need to look at our time or something like that.

32
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.659
This will allow us to just quickly do that from inside of here.

33
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.099
No debug object selected option is actually how we select the debug.

34
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.900
What we would do is when we play and call this UI widget, we would see its name up here

35
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.819
and be able to select it.

36
00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.340
The Widget Reflector is a great tool for diagnosing live widgets.

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.419
Say we run into an issue with a widget, and the only way to actually look at that issue

38
00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:42.379
is during the game when things are running, because maybe it's spawned off of something

39
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.379
else.

40
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.180
We would use the Widget Reflector to help us diagnose those problems for widgets that are

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.379
possibly spawned by other widgets or things that are happening while the project is running

42
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.780
that are kind of hard to see inside of this editor.

43
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.099
Then we have our palette and our library.

44
00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:09.579
Our library contains all of our various things for like a check mark box or an image or something

45
00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.579
like that.

46
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.420
We would actually use the library that much unless you are adding some custom content.

47
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.220
The palette on the other hand is where you're going to spend a majority of your time.

48
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.460
This is where we're going to find a lot of the functionality for our UI.

49
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.100
The first thing we need to do here though is add a Canvas panel.

50
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.380
I'm going to add that down here to our hierarchy.

51
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.060
That's going to add me a UI that can be stretched across an entire screen.

52
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.900
Pro tip, if you grab this little handle right here, you'll be able to stretch the UI to

53
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.219
various resolutions to see how it's going to look when it's set from 1280 by 720 to

54
00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:51.379
1136 by 640.

55
00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.900
There are a lot of different things inside of here.

56
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900
I'm not going to go through all of them.

57
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.500
I highly suggest that you go through and experiment.

58
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.099
To work with this stuff, all you simply need to do is just drag what you want from the

59
00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.419
palette there down to our hierarchy.

60
00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:15.459
Our hierarchy is going to show us the hierarchy of where things are placed inside of this

61
00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.459
UI.

62
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.899
I can also take things and I can have them independent from one another or I can have

63
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.540
them as a child of something else.

64
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.620
That's some really cool things that I can do.

65
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.259
Then we have our details panel.

66
00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.500
Much like the details panel in many of the other editors, it's going to be context sensitive

67
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.259
based off of what I have selected.

68
00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.060
You can see here when I select my whole UI, we get some different interactions over here

69
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.899
than when I select the canvas panel versus the button.

70
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:51.779
Speaking of the button, when we want to do something like have this button say be clickable,

71
00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.860
we will select that button and then over in the details panel under events, we have all

72
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.019
of these various events.

73
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:02.699
The cool thing about it is if we bring in something like a check mark box or maybe we

74
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.819
bring in an analog slider.

75
00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.860
With those selected and we come down to the events, notice we have the analog on analog

76
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.420
capture or on mouse capture begin, on mouse capture end.

77
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.779
What's really cool about this, I'm just like the button for easiness, but I'm going to

78
00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.300
click this on click and what it's going to do is it's going to change me over to the

79
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300
graph.

80
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.379
Notice I'm in something that looks kind of like blueprints and that's because the UMG

81
00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.420
designer or I should say UMG itself is broken up into a designer and a graph.

82
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.019
So the designers, how we make things pretty and the graph is how we make things functional.

83
00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:46.019
So on clicked, now I can pull off of this and do something like print and I could do

84
00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:47.019
a print string.

85
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:52.579
So when we press that button, we are going to print this hello a couple of things to

86
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:54.659
note from the graph here.

87
00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.459
If I come over here to my blueprint, notice I'm going to have like my pre construct, my

88
00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:59.979
events are up here.

89
00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.699
I have functions and macros that I can look at or override.

90
00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.500
Here is my variables so I can add variables much like I can in normal blueprints and then

91
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.339
I will get the details panel here will contain the various details if there is something

92
00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.459
that has details that I can use.

93
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.779
Go ahead and compile and save that.

94
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.819
Now you do need to set up UMG render widgets to be rendered to the screen, which is a little

95
00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:31.779
bit outside the scope of this, but trust in that this is a simple process and that UMG

96
00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.579
can be used to create any type of UI no matter what type of project you are creating.
