  "text": " Next up, let's have a look at render targets. So what is a render target? Well, a render target is a material which you can find and create from within the textures panel here. Got something that's called a render target. And what it is, is it will allow you to write to this material at runtime. So usually we would do this from a camera, and I'll demonstrate how we do that in a second. But let's first see the kind of effect that we've got. So here you go, we've got this TV here. And as I move around my, as I move around this actor with the camera on the right hand side, you can see that the TV is changing. So I'll just demonstrate that a bit further. So you can see at runtime, as the camera moves, the texture is updating on the television set. So what we have is this actor here. If I open this up and see how this is set up. And it's quite straightforward. There is no actual code which is required at this point. It's all done through a component. And the component is the SceneCatcherComponent2D. And once we've got that, we've got a number of different settings. So I could just add that by going add SceneCatcherComponent2D. Add it to the components. It's got a couple of different settings on here. And the main ones that you'd be worried about is the texture target. So this is the render target. So what it's going to be saving to. And what we have next to it as well, one of the other bits that's really, really useful, is CatcherEveryFrame. Now, these can be costly because if they are taking a photo every single frame, then you're basically rendering the whole scene twice. So you can be like almost doubling the cost of rendering your scene. So you have a camera miles away. It's going to have to render everything that that camera can see. So there are other options. You can either do it programmatically, so you tell it when you want to update, or you can just capture on movement by turning that off. Capture on movement, I think, is what I'm using throughout here to keep the cost down. So we add the render target. And you don't even think we need the camera. And here we can see it in the material setup. So I am just using the render target as a texture sample. And I'm plugging it through the emissive color. Now, the render target here, if I was to open this up, you're going to see that we have some options. One of the main ones is the size, because this is going to be the size of your texture. So in this, I've kept it quite small so that it all runs pretty fast, but they can get bigger. If you make them too big, they will give you a warning. The other thing that's worth noting, back up to the render target, is at the moment I'm capturing the scene color, but you do have a number of different options. I'll demonstrate those. I'll demonstrate one in a minute. You've got things like normals, the base color, final color, much like when we're working with scene textures, but it's quite a limited number. Right. So this is one example where you'd be able to show TV screens or something as you're going around. Let's have a look at a more common example. And that is a minimap. So if I was to fire this up, and press play, you can now see in the bottom corner here, I have a minimap. As I run through the level, it will update accordingly, depending on where my character is situated. So now how this is done is, again, we're doing it very similar to our last example. We have a minimap camera here, which has a, all it has is the scene capture component 2D. I'm then using event tick in order to make sure that the camera is moving with the character. But the main thing that's of interest is the capture source I'm using is the scene depth in the bar. So that will give me, in the red column, it's just going to give me the scene depth. So we've worked with scene depth before, and this is in centimeters. So when I would look at this, you would see that it just looks like it's solid red, because everything that it's logging back is in very high values, but only in the red channel. Now, you can see here we have the minimap. So if I jump in to see the minimap here, all we're doing is taking the texture sample, and again, we're dividing it so that we've got some kind of useful value. I'm using a cutoff just so that we can get an either a zero or a one, so that we can get that nice clean map. Now, you don't have to use the depth. You could easily use just a screenshot from above if you wanted a more realistic type, but that's what I've decided to use in this instance. And again, we're using a UMG to display this, and I'm just using the material on a image, and in front of it as well I've got another image which I'm updating the rotation of it based on the rotation of the player character, just so that we have that arrow which is alternating as we move. So I'm just demonstrating this. I'm not going to ask you to put it together, but that's how you might approach making a minimap. So that's render targets, very useful as a source or something to write to as we're going along.",
