  "text": " Now, in this next section of exploring Sequencer fundamentals, we're going to take a look at the core structures of Sequencer as we translate film concepts to the game engine. And before we get into using Sequencer, there is some terminology and comparisons that might help you understand Sequencer for first-time users. So, Unreal being a game engine has a more modular approach to building worlds. Plus, it has additional classifications of objects in order to create the game aspect of the engine. And you can use these classes to your distinct advantage as you understand the new terminology, such as the unique terms and actor classes that are broken down here into Engine Terminology and Sequencer Terminology. Now, with Engine Terminology, we'll discuss things like static and skeletal meshes, actors, pawns and characters, worlds, maps and levels, level sequences, control rigs, volumes, blueprints and source control. While Sequencer-specific terminology will discuss scene assemblies, performance takes, sets, layouts or staging, level sequences with shots, and of course, shots. Now, this section is a series of comparison charts that might help you transition from traditional filmmaking to using Unreal Engine for virtual production. And we start with our main components. So, as you can see in the Film section, we have the standards that you should already be familiar with. And in Unreal Engine, we can emulate these by thinking of our Engine components as similar to our traditional components. So, our location or back lot becomes our project, and inside that, we can break down levels to serve as the stage. From there, we can think of sub-levels as a set, and on those sets, we have static and skeletal mesh actors that serve as our props and performing actors. Finally, all the various crew, lights, cameras and other components that make the magic happen can be replicated through the various components in the Engine. In traditional filmmaking, cinematographers and directors would employ two primary types of filming techniques. First, there is the Master Scene technique, which effectively films action as it unfolds, from either a single camera or multiple cameras. Essentially, it's like filming a play or a very long sequence. Its linear nature ensures continuity, but traditionally, it's not very collaborative, and you're locked into a linear set of events. Unreal can mimic this technique with a single level sequence and a camera cuts track to cut between cameras, but it's not very effective. So, the other technique, known as a Triple Take technique, captures only the specific shot with enough overlapping animation or action, usually over three takes, to ensure continuity. Here, Unreal can make use of nesting level sequences to begin the process of non-linear footage manipulation. However, Unreal Engine now allows us to have a third option, a hybrid technique of the two earlier processes that can be created using tools in Unreal to subdivide the work. This is going to allow for multiple artists to work together at the same time. Of course, each technique does have its advantages and disadvantages, but with Sequencer, we can choose exactly which technique works best depending on how the project supervisor wants to manage your production. Now, in Unreal Engine, we have an Actor class that you've just been introduced to, known as a Level Sequence. And in a nutshell, a Level Sequence is another sort of container that can hold any number of actors, like static meshes, characters, lights, cameras, etc. And through the Level Sequence, you can provide these actors with a set of instructions through the use of keyframes for animation or blueprint coding for triggered events. Okay, now that we know what a Level Sequence is, we'll start from the bottom here and work our way up. But first, let's jump into the Engine to get going. So, Unreal Engine allows for the creation of individual shot level sequences that can be assembled to create a scene or film. And as you can see here, I've got five different scenes inside my film level. So, that's not all it can do. If I double-click into my scene, I have shots that are broken down here as well. And Unreal Engine will also allow me to provide a take system that allows artists to create alternate versions of any of these shot levels that contain a different set of instructions to allow me to create different variations for each take. So, if I go ahead and look at what is organized here under my course topics, in my shots, I have a folder for my scene one shot two, which is this one here. If I look inside that folder, I've got three different take options that are already existing in here for this particular shot. So, if I move through this shot, this is take one. And if I right-click on it and look at takes two by switching with to takes to take two, then I have a different set of camera instructions. If I switch out to take three, I have another shot with a different set of camera instructions. Now, from here, all I have to do to make a new version is to select one of the takes that I've got and hit Ctrl D to create a new take, take four. If I go up to right-click on takes and switch into now the new take four, I can double-click into this and start making adjustments to adjust the camera position, which I'm going to go ahead and click right here, select my mannequin, frame this character, and repose the entire thing until it's where I want it. So, let's get that other one right out of the way and move that over. And that's going to give me a camera position that I'm going to start from. So, let's go ahead and keyframe that position with an S and move that on down over here. Let's just do a slight move and pull, just enough to keep it out of the way. And if I hit S again, you can see I've got this very slight move here. So, if I switch back into my main level, you can see that's a brand new set of instructions for this. Possess each camera so you can see that. So, if I've locked my camera to my viewport, I can just make that move right there. And I can quickly go ahead and switch between any take that already exists. Just go ahead and save that. And then one thing I want to point out is that in traditional filmmaking, takes are typically a single continuous performance of varying duration where the actors go on set. They act out their performance and then the director calls cut. And typically you want another take, you just reset and do it all again. However, I've just shown you in Sequencer that all you really need to do to make a new take is just duplicate your shot. Make sure it's in the same folder and then make some changes to the action inside. So, once we're done, we can look at the scene level sequence where our shot level sequence lives and easily switch between the takes quickly, alternating between the two example shots and whichever version the director wants to keep. Or you can make another take and do additional changes without being destructive in nature. Now, as we look back at our film to Unreal Engine Structure Comparison Chart, we can work from the takes and shots at the bottom toward the film level sequence at the top. Just like the shot level sequences that make up scene level sequences, the scene level sequences can be nested into a sequence level sequence, and the sequence level sequences can be nested into an act level sequence. And act level sequences can be nested into a film sequence at the top of our chart. Of course, you aren't required to use all of these nested level sequences. You can just use what is necessary for your specific project. Finally, when you start working in Unreal Engine, you need to make sure that you have all the necessary plugins for your project enabled. Here is just a small list of what is an ever-changing and growing number of virtual production-specific engine plugins that can be enabled through the Plugins Editor. Now that's it for this section. Next, we're going to move on to explore some of Sequencer's features and tools.",
