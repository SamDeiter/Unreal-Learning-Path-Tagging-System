  "text": " In this part of the course, we're going to look at material editors, and we're going to be building a parent material and creating also an instance material. In the parent material, we'll be opening up parameters, organizing, and connecting the correct nodes for the material. So let's get started. So let's go ahead and create the material that we want to make. In this case, we're going to be imitating this stone material. It's kind of like a river stone or wet stone. And we're going to be applying it to this particular object here. So to be able to do that, let's first go to our content browser. And in our class material, let's go and right click and create a new material. You can also go to materials and also create a new material here. I'm going to go quickly here for a quick create of our asset. And I'm going to name it M underscore, or you can just have it M and the name, but it's better to put an underscore if you can. And we'll call this in class stone. Now if you were to do material instance, you can use our suffix where we have I and S T. If we right clicked and created a material instance, and we'll go and do that now. You can create a keep the suffix or have a prefix of M I. Now this is up to you how you want to tackle that. But there are multiple ways to do that. Now this creating an instance is now made a clone, or I should say a child of this particular first parent material. So all I do is right click and say create a material instance. Now you can also create a material instance of a material instance. Just keep in mind that they are connected. So whatever you change to one could very much affect the other if you're not careful and keeping track of what you're doing. So now that that's an instance, we're going to actually build this material and we're going to see some changes occur when we hit save to our instance material, keeping things active and open. Let's go ahead and grab this particular material and open it up. He went off screen. Let's go and pull them on into our screen here. What we want to do here is also pull in the textures that we want to use. In this particular case, the textures that we want to be using for our scene are going to be a thing called whetstone albedo. So let's go ahead and find that whetstone albedo. Our content browser should have it. There we go. And he's found if you look into your files for the class underneath the mega scan and you'll see whetstone ground. What we really want to grab is the albedo. We can grab the normal in here. We can grab the rough. And overall, those things should actually be OK for what we need. We don't need the others such as the AO and a few other things. So we can just grab these here and pull them into our scene. Now let's go ahead and start connecting things. And as I walk you through this, it's going to make more sense and you'll understand how the process works. It's really not complicated, but as you get deeper and deeper into materials, complication can occur and the fact that you need to know what you're doing and what your nodes will do. And in our other classes, we'll walk you through those step by step. I'm going to close some of the tabs at the bottom here to give ourselves a little more real estate. So the first thing we want to do is make it so that we have an albedo connection to our base color. But we want to be able to maybe control the tent. Now later on in other classes, I'll show you how to control tent amount. In this case, we'll keep it pretty simple where we just have a tent connection. We're going to use a node called the multiply. Now the multiplies and I'll hit the A key. That was the M plus the left key to get that multiply. You can also search for if you want to multiply. You can also hit the A key and left clicking to an ad. I want to talk about the difference between these because they do have a different reaction similar to what you have in filters and in Photoshop, where the ad will have a different application and the multiply will have a different application as you mix and match these. We're going to stick with multiply for this. This is going to give us our full color range and be able to make it so that we can actually control the albedo tent a little bit easier. I'm going to go ahead and hit a four constant vector. Now the four constant vector allows us to get a full range of color. I can do this with a three constant vector too. So I'm going to keep my finger to the three key and left click. There's the three constant and you keep my finger on the four key and left click and there's a four constant. Those are the two hot keys that pull them up. Let me get rid of the three constant so it's consistent with our nodes. So I got a four constant vector. I want to keep that as white and this is going to work best with the multiply in this case and I'm going to hit OK. I'm going to move that to the B channel, pull that string on the very top to the B channel of our multiply. And then I grab the texture sample and pull the RGB, the whole kit and caboodle as you say all the channels into the A channel. What I also want to do is make sure that I open up this parameter so that material instance that we made will now be able to talk back and forth between each other and make it so that if we can change things on the fly with little to really no compiling at all. So I'm going to right click here and convert to a parameter. I'm going to call this El Vido. And what you'll notice with this selected, I can go to the details here and I can see that it requires or actually has a slot for grouping. You do want to group, especially if your material starts to get complicated. In this particular group, we'll call this El Vido and I'll hit Enter. I can choose how it sorts in our instance material. So if we go to the content browser for a second, we go back to our in class folder. We will see that instance material. If I double click on it, pull it up, let me pull it into our screen. You'll see we have areas that will be populated. So being able to control the sorting priority, I can choose where it falls into play. I'm just going to leave it for now. That's fine. And I'm going to also open up our parameters here for our tint. I'm going to right click and go to convert to parameter. Now that I've converted this to parameter, I'm going to call this El Vido tint. There we go. Also going to group it. We can group it as El Vido. And then we can also put a note for ourselves. So this is neat. This is really cool. This allows you to organize. And if somebody is looking at material, they know what they're looking at. So this is pretty straightforward, but for education purposes, I'm going to show you how it works. I'm going to select these two and hit the C key that allows me to create a comment. Open this up, click on the comment at the top and just call this El Vido breakdown. Simple. There we go. Pretty nice. And that keeps things a bit more organized. I can move this around. We can include that multiply in there if we want to. Now they move that around and I can also go in here and at any time you can even create multiple ones like say, hey, this is the multiply hit the C key. It's up to you how you want to do it. And if you don't want them like, oh man, I didn't mean to make that it's you can't accident. Just hit delete and it doesn't affect your other notes. Pretty nice. Let's go and grab that multiply string and put that into the base right there. Now you do have some tools which are actually kind of nice working with Unreal, which allows you to be able to go in here. And if I right click a node, I can align, I can control my alignment. I can copy paste, delete. You can collapse a node. So there's a few things in here, not only just open up our parameters, you can even enable preview and see what it looks like ahead of time before you apply it. Which is actually kind of nice. To be able to change between node links, there are several little hotkeys that you can use. So say I didn't want my RGB, but if I keep my finger on my control and float over the node, I can actually move and reroute that switch. You can also create named reroute nodes. If you have run into situations where you have a lot of crossed wires and you want to be able to make it a little bit cleaner. I'll briefly talk about this a little bit more advanced, but I can do like a thing called a named reroute node. And this one could be add stuff. And I can add this here and then down below. And let me disconnect these couple of times. I can have that same add stuff. I'll just do control D down here connecting. So I don't have to actually cross my wires and make it all noodley. That's a little bit more advanced, but I thought I'd show you real quick. So let's get back to it here. We have texture sample here for our normal, and we also have a texture sample for our rough.",
