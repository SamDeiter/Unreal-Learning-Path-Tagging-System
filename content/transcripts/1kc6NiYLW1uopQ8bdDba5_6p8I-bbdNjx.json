  "text": " The project opens up in what is essentially an empty scene, except for a few props. This is the main level when using an AEC template. You can see the level asset in the Content Browser. Except for the few additional folders and subfolders in the Content Browser, this is the same startup you get when you start a blank project using an AEC template. If you see a message about available plugins, you can dismiss it. Also, I would recommend enabling the Show Sources panel in the Content Browser to make it easier to navigate through a selection tree. Let's talk about levels for a minute. As you may know, a level is a container of actors in a scene. So this main level has a floor, a camera and a few props including a daylight system. If you look around by right-clicking and dragging, you'll see an atmosphere with a blue gradient in the sky and a sun disc. If you were to select the Sun Sky actor in the scene, and you can do so in the World Outliner, you can see that you can change parameters like location, date and time. As you change the time value, the sun disc moves in the sky and the colors change to warmer tones. Arguably, what is missing here is some kind of a cloud layer. We'll take care of that in a moment. At any time, you can start adding more actors to your existing level or you can create a new one. If you use File -> New Level, you can create a new level altogether and in this case, you can choose between a totally empty level or one that is called Time of Day, which is a bit similar to the one you currently have. Go ahead and choose Time of Day. Do not save the changes you have made so far. A slightly different scene loads but takes a bit of time to compensate for the lighting. Again, we'll address this a little later in this class. This scene is not unlike the one you just left but ironically, even though the level is labeled Time of Day, there is nothing in here that relates to this label. There are various lighting components in place including a sunlight but none of them show a Time of Day parameter in the Details panel. Perhaps the name stems from a keyboard hotkey that lets you dynamically change the position of the sun in the sky. If you hold Ctrl-L and move the mouse around, you are effectively changing the time of day without punching in a value. Both scenarios work well. We'll be using the first one for our efforts. However, we can use this one to extract the cloud layers that the other one didn't have. In the World Outliner, select the Sky Dome mesh and Volumetric Cloud actors and then press Ctrl-C to copy them to memory. Reload the main level. You do not need to save this one. And press Ctrl-V to paste the two actors from the other level. And press Ctrl-V to paste the two actors from the other level. Now in addition to the gradient background, you have cloud layers as well. Delete the floor. You are not likely to need it as you start building your project. You can also do some housekeeping with the existing actors. These are all essential to the look and feel of a scene, so let's group them together to make them easier to locate and manipulate. Right-click in the World Outliner and create a new folder. Name it!Essentials. The exclamation point is just to ensure the folder remains at the top of the Outliner, making it even more accessible. Select all the actors and move them inside of that folder to ensure easier access. To prevent from messing with the startup level, save this new edited level by using File, save current as and navigate to the Levels folder. Save the new level as 00-underscore-my-start. You can see there are quite a few more levels saved in this folder already. We'll be going through them as we go from one topic to another. We'll also be working with sub-levels or level streaming, which let you load and unload maps or levels, so that only those loaded take up resources and are rendered at any given point. In their simplest form, you can use sub-levels as a scene management technique to toggle the visibility of actors on and off. You can see an example of this by loading up the level named 07Render. It shows the end results of this class, in essence what we are going to build together. You can look around the scene if you like. However, let's take a look at the panel named Levels. If it is not displayed in the Unreal interface, you can call it up from the Window pull-down menu. The panel can be floating or can be docked. I myself like to have it next to the Outliner. Note the sub-levels. We'll learn to work with them in a minute, but try to toggle them on and off to see how they affect the visibility of actors in the scene. In the case of the grass, you may need to zoom in to see the effect. Go back to the level you created earlier. You don't need to save this one. If you missed that on creating your own 00MyStart level, you can also use a similarly named 01Start level. Next, you start building the plaza.",
