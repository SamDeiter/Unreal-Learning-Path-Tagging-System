  "text": " Hello, and welcome to the Epic Games Collaboration Tools training for MegaReview. My name is Kevin Miller and I am an instructor for Epic Games. Now a quick reminder that this is an internal training and it is not to be shared outside of Epic Games. We will start though with a brief introduction to MegaReview and then run through the user interface demonstrating each section as we go. Finally, this short walkthrough will end with some support resources that you can use if you run into any problems while using MegaReview. So let's get started. For users that are just starting out with this tool, you're probably wondering, what is MegaReview? Well, MegaReview is Epic Games' collaborative media review tool that allows users to browse, playback and annotate media in dailies in real time. Primarily, we will be using the web-based version of this tool, but MegaReview does offer integration with ShockGrid for use as the backend. This allows users to select and view the dailies of projects already in ShockGrid, draw directly on media frames and leave annotated notes, jump from the MegaReview entry directly to the reference ShockGrid entity, browse and create playlists, search for dailies by name, author, status, where it currently sits in the pipeline and save those searches for later. However, the main use of this tool is for users to collaborate with each other in sync sessions for media review. To do that, you'll need to know your way around. So let's explore the user interface and see what tools are currently available in MegaReview. As I take you through the user interface, I'm going to break it down into two parts. And I'll start with the top bar. The top bar is the primary media management toolset for MegaReview. And first up is the navigation tree. This toggle button allows users to show and hide your playlist folders. From there, the media playlist views buttons are switches that allow users to show, hide or switch into their preferred media playlist viewer. First is a simple list view. Next, we have the gallery view. And finally, a table view that offers additional information such as the media name, description, name of the user that uploaded the media, the date of creation, and using the double lines users can also reorder the media in this view. Next up are the media tools, which is a set of buttons that allows users to upload their version of the media through an upload window or download that media after a review session in one of several ways such as a current frame, current frame with sketches on it, the original video or a transcoded video. This tool set also allows users to add media to an existing playlist or create a new playlist as I'll demonstrate in a moment. Moving over to the right side of the toolbar, users will find the sync options. The start sync button will start a review session, allow users to pause or continue a session, leave or stop a session for all users, create a shareable link to that specific session, or using the share button, create a link for the entire mega review session. The last of the sync options is the notes button, where users can create notes prior to a sync or within an active review session. Finally, there are two view options in the upper right hand corner next to the user icon. These are the presentation view, which it should be noted will have a lockout function added in the near future, allowing users to give presentations without being interrupted and of course the full screen view. Now let's jump into the web-based mega review and take a look at an example as I walk you through uploading media, creating playlists and looking through each of these functions. For users just starting out with mega review, a list of projects will be assigned to you through your organization. If you don't see a list of projects, you can use the refresh button in the upper left hand corner to log back into mega review through the authentication system. If you still don't see your project to which you should have been assigned, you can request access to that mega review project through sale point. Once approved, just refresh and select your project to open up the mega review interface. Now when mega review first opens up, you will see that one of the view options is active. And if you've already been in mega review, you will start out with the last view you set up. So the navigation tree in the upper left hand corner could be active and your preferred view could also be active. So for me, the list view is active. But I'm going to walk you through here the gallery view, which can be adjusted by sliding in and out, or the list view, which you can also move to adjust and view more information. Now as I want to keep things clean and simple, I'm going to go ahead and leave this in my list view. And from here, I want to upload a new piece of media. But before I do that, I'm going to move up over to the right hand corner and activate the full screen option. So I can also exit using the full screen button or you'll see this X pop up. But the reason I wanted to make full screen active is because uploading media will also exit the full screen. And if I move here to upload a new version of media, you'll see me get kicked out and the upload media window open. From here, I'm going to choose a new piece of media to upload. And for that, I'm going to select the Spider Shock UV set. Once that's done, I hit open and I wait for it to transcode. Once the file is successfully uploaded, then I'm going to need to organize it into my playlist. Now one thing to note is that my Spider Shock playlist is only for concept. Inside there, I have my model or my asset as well. By using the three dots here, I can remove from playlist. If I have permissions, I can delete the media and keep things organized as well. But I'm just going to remove this from the playlist. Now I'm going to need a new playlist for that to go into. So I'm going to go ahead and use the playlist button to add a new playlist. And for that, I'm going to type 04 asset model S. I'm going to go ahead and create that. Now I have my Spider Shock color selected, but that's not the asset I want to work with. So I'm going to go ahead and close this. If I move into my asset model, you'll notice I didn't name this fully. So I'm going to use these three dots. I'm going to use the option to rename this to model Spider Shock. Now I've saved this, and I want to move assets in here. But those assets aren't in other playlists. They're located in my most recent section. I'm going to go ahead and select first my model. And I'm going to add this to my playlist, select my asset model Spider Shock playlist folder, and link it. I'm going to do the same with my UV asset. Hit that button, select my Spider Shock model, and apply that link as well. That way, I can see that in my playlist, both of those assets are active. Now that my playlists are organized and named correctly, I'm ready to start a media sync review session. Though I have a few decisions to make before I do that. I can start a session using the sync button. Copy this link to this specific session and share it with others for a real time session. Or activate my notes and create annotations, and then share this sync for those before I start. While inside my sync, I can pause or continue the sync. I can also leave the sync with two options. Leaving it and using the URL to reaccess that link. Or end the sync for all users. So before I show you a media sync review session with multiple active users, it's going to be helpful to jump back into our slides and walk through that user interface. Next, I want to walk you through the tools that are available in the media sync review session. The review session toolset most users will work with are the media drawing tools in the upper left hand corner directly above the viewport. Aside from the move or hand button, the media drawing tools switch between the laser pointer, pen, and erase tool options. The drawing tool modifiers located in the middle of the toolbar directly affect the active drawing tools. Three width presets allow users to select a brush size of 10 pixels, 16 pixels, or 32 pixels. And the red circle opens the color selection option. Over to the right corner of the toolbar is the edit and orient tool starting with the undo and redo buttons. These become active once users begin annotations. Next to them is the zoom out and zoom in buttons which affect the viewport. As does the flip horizontally button at the end of this group. Moving to the bottom of the viewport, we see the timeline controls. Here users will find the playhead which indicates the active frame and can be directly selected to scrub through the timeline within the video media. Users can also set a playback range by using the middle mouse button and dragging the playhead from a start frame to a desired end frame. In the bottom left corner users will find the playback controls which allows for stepping a frame forward or backward, playing the media, or activating the looping option which can be applied to the entire timeline or just a set range. Next to the playback controls is the frame rate where users can click to choose one of the several preset playback options or set a custom frame rate. Finally users will see a time indicator that shows the current time code versus the duration of the media. An audio volume control and a frame indicator showing the current frame versus total number of frames. Now let's jump back into the web-based mega review and have a quick look at these tools in action. For this media sync multi-user session I'm connected through my tower and my laptop but I'm also joined by Sean Spitzer, a senior instructor here at Epic Games and the lead on the ILT Unified Content example. Sean is currently driving the timeline using the play button to view the entire turntable video for the MIS-MEC robot mode. As the turntable moves I've identified an area that needs revision or completion. As Sean and I are in a zoom meeting I take over. I create a set playback range using the middle mouse and drag button and then I highlight the shoulder area with the laser pointer which is not permanent. Sean acknowledges the revision point. He steps between frames before choosing one and then flips the image horizontally as his preference when working on notation. Sean then uses the pen and eraser tools to draw over the joint showing what he wants for a revision. As Sean does this drawing I'm going to zoom in and look at what he's actually doing with the zoom in and zoom out buttons. While Sean creates this joint the draw over is not affected by my zooming in. Once completed with his revision Sean types up an annotation note. Now on my laptop I moved frame one and type up an additional note for this session. Now I'm ready to download the frame so that I have notes that I need for the revision. To do that I move up to the frame that we were working on, move to the download version, and do download current frame with sketches. Once the download is complete I'm ready to end the sync for everyone as our multi-user review session has been completed. Now before we wrap up the mega review training I want to leave users with a few resources to help with growing accustomed to this new tool set. Starting with everyone's favorite the current hotkeys beginning with the grave accent key in the navigation toggle set and then the second key. Now I'm going to go ahead and click on the link in the description to see what's going on. Now I'm going to go ahead and click on the link in the navigation toggle set running through the annotation controls or command key options depending on your operating system and finishing with the playback options I want to note that additional hotkeys will be introduced in future updates. Next are a few helpful links starting with the slack channel where users will find additional resources and links to the sale point where you can get started One last thing to note is that if users encounter an error where the uploaded media fails to transcode it is recommended to contact support through the slack channel. That's it for the epic games collaboration tools training for mega review. I hope this helps get things started and thank you for your time.",
