  "text": " Before we get into our last module of a little workshop of just going through the packaging process so we can all do it together. I just wanted to talk a little bit about packaging for teams and especially for larger teams moving over to Unreal Engine. Just talking about some of the automation process and build processes that you can include as part of your pipeline. So we have an Unreal Engine automation tool. You'll see it referenced as UAT a lot of the times. And the automation tool enables you to cook and package your game using command lines. So throughout this whole course we've been talking about cooking and packaging our game directly through the editor. But there is an automation tool that's outside the editor that you can use to run command lines and batch files. The files can be found in the engine build batch file location and depending on if you are running Windows or Mac or Linux. You'll be using a different file structure there. So the automation tool is definitely recommended. If you are looking to automate your build process in Unreal Engine and we have included the documentation link at the bottom here for you to explore that further. As I mentioned on a previous slide, command lines are supported. So basic cook can be performed using the following command line arguments which are written down here. Just note that the command line must be specified via the dash run equals cook and a platform to cook must be specified. So as I've got an example below there, just make sure you're following that file structure. And again, any of the command line arguments that you can use in Unreal Engine are linked at the bottom here. As I mentioned, we wanted to break down exactly what happens when you click package project. And all of these different stages are documented on the Unreal Engine learn section. So if there's anything you really want to dig into here, definitely go and research that. But as part of the build run in the automation tool, we first have the build stage which compiles the executables for the selected platform. Then as we've gone into detail on we then cook, which is executing the editor in a special mode. Then we stage the build. So the stage copies the executables and the content to a staging area, which is a standalone directory outside of the development directory. Then we package, which packages the project into the platform's native distribution format. So again, when we're talking about cooking and packaging the content here, it needs to be deployed, whether it's for a PC or console or anything along those lines. Then we're deploying the build to the target platform and then we can run the package build on that target platform. So we're going through this build cook run process in the automation tool. I've also got the Unreal build tool, which is the UBT for short, which is a custom tool that manages the process of building the source code across different configurations. You can definitely check out the CS file to explore the different build options. And of course, link the documentation below if that is something you'd like to look into. Unreal Game Sync is a very handy tool for teams working on Unreal Engine. So if there's multiple developers on the project, it really helps promote the code and content collaboration in the development environment. And it's just a nice graphical front end for teams using Unreal Engine to use. Just to note, this is using Perforce, so you can optionally build those projects using Microsoft's Visual Studio Compiler. I'll dig into Game Sync more in the next slide, but again, just to highlight the documentation is below there for UGS. And the reason why UGS is good for teams working on Unreal Engine, because programmers as part of their workflow, they'll be syncing the project files with the repository. They'll resolve any conflicts and update engine version files. They'll generate the project files and maybe build the code in UE5 and then run the project. Whereas, if you're an artist or a visual developer or someone not needing to worry about merging conflicts and generating project files, you just want to sync your files and make sure that you know that all the files are up to date and that you can run the correct version of the Unreal project. So UGS can kind of skip that for a lot of artists and other developers on the project. So just taking a bit of time to investigate UGS might be worthwhile for multiple collaborators on a project. And again, it has a nice graphical interface that is just a developer friendly environment to work in. Horde is also becoming the main powerhouse behind build automation, and it's what Epic uses to develop Fortnite and other Unreal Engine projects. It does combine some of the tools that we've already spoken about, but it's a brand new architecture that's aimed for centralizing some of the processes in this cooking and packaging and managing content. So previously, where these different tools have been separately developed, Horde aims to integrate the whole process here. So Horde has the remote execution using the UBA, which we had mentioned. It still does the build automation working with per-files repositories. You can do the test automation, which is integrated either with the automation tool or Gauntlet, which I have linked documentation to about what Gauntlet is. I believe it's not officially supported by Unreal Engine. It's kind of a tool used internally, but the information and code is there for it to be used if developers want to do that. Good thing about Horde is that it also uses the studio analytics, which can receive telemetry from Unreal, and also uses the Unreal Game Sync, which I mentioned in the previous slide with teams working in Unreal Engine. It also has the console device manager, as well as mobile, I should say, which helps managing the final development kits and mobile devices. So this really helps centralize all the different processes that you need in the team. So Horde is definitely worth checking out and worth reading the documentation of. It's also just worth noting as we close out this section here that there was a great talk at the Unreal Fest 2024 about how to set up the studio using Unreal Engine the epic way. And yeah, I just highly recommend watching that talk and just getting an idea about how you might want to set up your processes in the studio, especially if you're new to Unreal Engine.",
