00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello, and welcome to MetaHuman Blueprints in Animation.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.759
My name is Gabriella Crusenio-Cacchus, and I will be your host for this course.

3
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.440
In this course, we will begin by exploring the various components that make up the MetaHuman

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.199
Blueprint.

5
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.019
We will go through each component in detail in order to understand the assets associated

6
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.380
with them, such as the skeletal meshes and rigs, the grooms, the LOD sync and MetaHuman

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:40.420
component, rig logic, and the animation blueprints used by all MetaHumans.

8
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.219
From there, we will delve into ways you can animate MetaHumans by creating and fine-tuning

9
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.859
animations using the body and face control rigs, touching upon the IK Retargetor assets

10
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.859
for the body, and facial animation tools that are set up to work with MetaHumans.

11
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.700
We will also take a look at the quality differences between optimized and cinematic MetaHumans,

12
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.920
and then we will wrap up this course with some final recommendations as we make adjustments

13
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.780
to the properties of various MetaHuman components.

14
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.620
And I will also provide you with some tips and resources for you to use as you continue

15
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.579
your work and training with MetaHumans.

16
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:37.500
This course will be using the project MEH9130055 and a level map should load automatically.

17
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:47.700
The map is located in the Content Browser under the Courses folder labeled MEH21301

18
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.340
in the Course Maps folder and it is named MEH21301MAP.

19
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.020
In the Course Assets folder, I have included body animations from the Game Animation Sample

20
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.379
project.

21
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:11.699
In the folder named MHMocap, there is a body and facial animation.

22
00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:18.259
The facial animation has been captured using MetaHuman Animator with an iPhone device,

23
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:24.899
and the body has been captured with motion capture data and also includes finger data.

24
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:32.899
In the Source Files folder named 21301AnimAsset, I have also provided a body animation UAsset

25
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.219
file.

26
00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.899
If at any point you need to reference the location of the course map, that can be found

27
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.140
at the beginning of the slide deck after the training outline.

28
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.900
Now as we go through this course, you will find that many slides in this presentation

29
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.540
contain a lot of information.

30
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.659
And I will summarize all of that, but if at any point you want to read what is on each

31
00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.540
of those slides, feel free to pause and dive right in.

32
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.939
Now let's move on to the first section of this course by exploring the MetaHuman Blueprint

33
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.939
and its components.
