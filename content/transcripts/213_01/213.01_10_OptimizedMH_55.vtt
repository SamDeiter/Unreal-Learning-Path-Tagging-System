00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
In this section of our course, we are going to take a look at the optimized metahumans.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.759
We have the option of downloading from Quixel Bridge.

3
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.920
And look at how they differ from the cinematic quality metahumans that we have been looking

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.120
at up until now.

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.719
Optimized metahumans are available to download for Unreal Engine versions 5.4 and later.

6
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:32.759
They allow for better performance while offering comparable levels of fidelity to the cinematic

7
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.479
ones.

8
00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.320
You can choose between high, medium, and low optimized.

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.280
The average file size is under 100 megabytes as opposed to the cinematic ones that range

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.000
between 2 to 3 gigabytes.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.840
They come with compressed textures and optimized materials as opposed to the full resolution

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.000
textures with separate materials.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.880
The harems are also optimized and the LODs have been adjusted with animation settings

14
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.800
that enable and disable correctives based on LOD.

15
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.719
Now let's jump into Unreal Engine and take a look at these differences.

16
00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:26.560
Throughout this course, we have been using the cinematic quality version of this metahuman.

17
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.920
In the metahumans folder, we also have a low optimized version of this character.

18
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.960
I have opened up the blueprints for both the cinematic and low optimized versions of this

19
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200
character.

20
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.879
Going back to the cinematic quality version, let's compare some of the components.

21
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:55.000
With the body components selected, let's open up the skeletal mesh for this metahuman.

22
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.359
We will see all of the joints and correctives are present.

23
00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:06.840
Now if we go to the low quality version and open up the skeletal mesh, we will notice

24
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.759
that this has a simplified version of the skeleton.

25
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.000
If we toggle between the two skeletons, we will notice that the cinematic quality skeleton

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.759
has the correctives and the low optimized one does not.

27
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.560
Now let's compare the face components of these two.

28
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.360
If we select the face component on the cinematic quality version and then open up the skeletal

29
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.639
mesh, we will see all of the joints and correctives are present.

30
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:48.479
Now if we go to the low optimized version, select the face component and then open up

31
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:55.719
the skeletal mesh, we will notice we have a more simplified skeleton.

32
00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.879
We can compare the two if we toggle between them.

33
00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.119
Going back to the cinematic quality blueprint, we will also see all of the material instances

34
00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.739
this has for the face.

35
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.140
If we compare this with the low optimized version, we can see this only has four simplified

36
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.939
material instances.

37
00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:26.140
Now going back to the cinematic version, if we select the metahuman component, we will

38
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.420
see that we have physics for the clothing and can choose if we want to disable correctives.

39
00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.699
If we compare this with the low optimized version by selecting the metahuman component,

40
00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.699
we will see that there is no physics for the clothing and the correctives are disabled

41
00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.500
by default.

42
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.500
Now going back to the cinematic version, if we select the lod sync component, we have

43
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.060
eight lod's.

44
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.060
If we compare this with the low optimized version by selecting the lod sync component,

45
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.500
we will see that this has only two lod's.

46
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.900
Now before we move on, let's do a quick review of what we just covered.

47
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.019
When comparing the face and body skeletons of the optimized and cinematic metahumans,

48
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.259
the optimized ones will have reduced bone count and may not have any correctives for

49
00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.379
the neck and body.

50
00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:38.139
Optimized metahumans have been specifically tailored with performance in mind, especially

51
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.060
when working in games, mobile or with real time experiences.

52
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.060
Now let's begin to wrap up this course with some final recommendations.
