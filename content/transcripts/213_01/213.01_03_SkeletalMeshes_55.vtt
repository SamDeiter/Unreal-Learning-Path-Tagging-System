1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
We will begin by looking at all of the skeletal mesh components, which include the body, the

2
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.880
feet, the legs, the torso, and we will finish off with the face.

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.800
So let's jump back into Unroll Engine and take a closer look at each of these.

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's begin by looking at the body component on the left over here.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.679
When selected, in the Details panel on the right, we can see all of the properties and

6
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:40.280
assets associated with this component, such as the material and skeletal mesh.

7
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.159
If we open up the skeletal mesh, it will have skinning for the hands and ankles, as this

8
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.560
character also has clothes.

9
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.480
If we go up here to the top right and we select the Skeleton tab, it will open up the MetaHuman

10
00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.000
based skeleton, which is shared by all MetaHumans.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.319
It will always be the female medium normal body weight and it is located in the common

12
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.120
folder.

13
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.920
If I go to the Animation tab over here, I can search for mh body animation and select

14
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.519
it.

15
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:21.400
We can see this animation sequence in this window.

16
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.920
All of the animations over here are shared by all MetaHumans in the project, and this

17
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.040
is because they all share the MetaHuman based skeleton.

18
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
Let's return back to the MetaHuman blueprint.

19
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.920
And before we move on, let's do a quick review of what we just covered.

20
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.200
The body component has a skeletal mesh with its own material.

21
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.080
The skeletal mesh will have its own unique skinning and body proportion, and it will

22
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.719
be located in the folder with the name of your MetaHuman.

23
00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.959
The MetaHuman based skeleton is shared by all MetaHumans in a project and is located

24
00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.039
in the common folder.

25
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.319
This will always be the female medium normal body weight.

26
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.759
The body component also includes animation sequences, animation blueprints, and a physics

27
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.259
asset.

28
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:24.019
Now let's continue by taking a look at the feet and legs components.

29
00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.780
Let's move on to the feet component.

30
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.579
If I select the feet, over here on the right, we can see that this has its own skeletal

31
00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.219
mesh and material associated with it.

32
00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.299
Since MetaHumans are modular, we are able to switch between skeletal meshes and groom

33
00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.099
assets if we wish.

34
00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.419
There are other MetaHumans that have been added to this project with their own unique

35
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:55.979
skeletal meshes for the feet, so we can switch between those by going over here.

36
00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:02.180
For example, we could switch these boots out with flip flops, but keep in mind differences

37
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.060
in body proportions and skinning when replacing assets.

38
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.939
Now let's move on to the legs component.

39
00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.699
In the Details panel on the right, this component will have its own skeletal mesh assigned and

40
00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.500
its associated material.

41
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.819
There may be cases where you want to add additional custom clothing.

42
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.819
In this case, you can add a new skeletal mesh component.

43
00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:36.099
To do this, go to the Add sign and search for skeletal mesh.

44
00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.740
In the Details panel on the right, you would assign the skeletal mesh asset.

45
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.340
And then, with the skeletal mesh selected, you would drag this over the body to make

46
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.139
it a child of the body.

47
00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.259
The next step is to go to the construction script.

48
00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:03.979
Inside of here, drag the skeletal mesh component into the construction script.

49
00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:10.699
We can see how all of the skeletal mesh components are connected to Enable Master Pose nodes

50
00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.899
and are all set up to follow the body.

51
00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:18.459
We will need to do the same for this skeletal mesh component.

52
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.579
To do this, select this Enable Master Pose node and press Ctrl D to duplicate it.

53
00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:36.740
Then, connect the skeletal mesh component to the Enable Master Pose node.

54
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.899
And then connect this to the other master pose nodes so that it follows the body.

55
00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:50.500
Now before we move on, let's review what we just covered.

56
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.299
For clothing components such as the feet and legs, you can replace these with custom skeletal

57
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.020
mesh assets.

58
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.500
Or, if you have metahumans in your project with different skeletal meshes for these components,

59
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.819
you can switch between them.

60
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.580
Just keep in mind differences in skinning and proportions.

61
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.860
If you want to create your own custom clothes, you can download the Maya file from the Quixel

62
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.939
Bridge standalone application and use the clothes as a starting point to get skinning

63
00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.019
and LOD templates transferred to your skeletal mesh.

64
00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:34.579
If you wish to add a skeletal mesh clothing component, ensure you make it a child of the

65
00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:41.220
body component, then add it into the construction script, connect it to its own Enable Master

66
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.180
Pose node, and then connect it to the rest of the Enable Master Pose nodes so that it

67
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.100
follows the body.

68
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.580
Now let's continue by looking at the torso component.

69
00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.460
I'm going to select it and go to the details panel and open up the skeletal mesh.

70
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.980
Some clothing assets will have physics such as this hoodie sweater.

71
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.780
If I go here to the top right and then go to the physics tab, inside of here we have

72
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.820
the physics asset for the hoodie.

73
00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:22.099
On the left here we can select the hoodie strings or specific portions of the hoodie

74
00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.019
strings.

75
00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:30.459
On the right hand side in the details panel we can modify the physics properties.

76
00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.939
Now if we go to the animation blueprint tab, this will open up the animation blueprint

77
00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:38.139
of the hoodie.

78
00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.699
Inside of here we can enable and disable the rigid body simulation and make other adjustments

79
00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.139
to the LOD threshold for the rigid body and control rig.

80
00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.060
If you want to have further control over the rigid body settings, you can do so in the

81
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.420
clothing post-process animation blueprint.

82
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.060
To access this I have the body skeletal mesh docked over here.

83
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:14.579
Inside of here I can go to the animation blueprint tab and drop this down and select

84
00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:19.500
the clothing post-process animation blueprint.

85
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.819
Inside of here we can see how the rigid body node is set up and by selecting it we can

86
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.219
adjust its properties.

87
00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:36.779
Now before we move on let's review what we just covered.

88
00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:40.099
We just took a look at the torso component.

89
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.220
Some of the clothing assets such as the hoodie sweater may have physics.

90
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.340
The physics properties can be adjusted inside of the physics window of that skeletal mesh.

91
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:59.400
The clothing animation blueprint will allow you to enable and disable rigid body simulation

92
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.500
and control the LODs.

93
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.620
In the animation graph of the clothing post-process animation blueprint, the rigid body node allows

94
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.139
you to modify additional simulation properties.

95
00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:23.019
Now let's continue by taking a look at the face component.

96
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:25.939
Let's move on to the face component.

97
00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:31.899
In the details panel we will see that the face skeletal mesh has several materials assigned

98
00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:38.379
to different portions of the face such as the skin, the eyes and so on.

99
00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:42.220
Let's open up the skeletal mesh.

100
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:49.899
Now let's go here to character, select bones and select all hierarchy.

101
00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:54.419
We can see that the face has a large number of joints.

102
00:08:54.419 --> 00:09:01.700
I'm going to go back to character, then bones and set the joints to none.

103
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.820
Over here on the right in the morph target panel you will find that the metahuman face

104
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.460
also has a large number of blend shapes and corrective blend shapes.

105
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.700
Now let's go to the skeleton tab.

106
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.780
This will open up the face archetype skeleton which is shared by all metahumans and this

107
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.860
is located in the common face folder.

108
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:32.100
If we go to the blueprints tab, the face will have two animation blueprints.

109
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:38.460
The face NMBP which has dedicated AR kit and animation retargeting functions and the

110
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.740
face post process blueprint.

111
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.779
The face post process blueprint is where Rik logic and the net correctives are set up.

112
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:55.379
From here we can enable and disable certain features related to optimization and animation

113
00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.460
quality.

114
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:08.820
Now before we move on let's review what we've just covered.

115
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:16.660
The face component assets include the face archetype located in the common face folder,

116
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:23.900
the face skeletal mesh which will be unique for your character, animation sequence assets

117
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.019
and animation blueprints.

118
00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:32.939
The face post process animation blueprint is where the Rik logic node lives.

119
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:41.259
Rik logic is responsible for allowing animations to be shared across all metahumans and LODs.

120
00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:47.939
It's also responsible for triggering corrective blend shapes and animated wrinkle maps when

121
00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.659
animations are applied.

122
00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:56.579
By disabling the face post process blueprint it will only trigger joint deformations which

123
00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.060
will reduce the animation quality but improve performance.

124
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.900
Now let's move on and take a look at the groom components.
