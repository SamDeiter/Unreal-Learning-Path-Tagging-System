00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this section of our course, we will begin by exploring the MetaHuman Blueprint and we'll go through each of the components in detail.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We will take a close look at the skeletal meshes and rigs, the grooms, the LOD sync and MetaHuman component, rig logic, and the animation blueprints used by all MetaHumans.

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All of the assets that can be found in the MetaHuman Blueprint are located inside of the MetaHuman's folder.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's begin by taking a look at what's inside the MetaHuman's folder and then we will delve into the MetaHuman Blueprint and all of its assets.

5
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Once a MetaHuman has been exported from Quixel Bridge to Unreal Engine and all of the necessary plugin and project settings have been enabled, you can navigate to the MetaHuman's folder in the Content Browser.

6
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The Common folder contains assets that are shared by some or all MetaHumans in a project.

7
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Those assets include the shared MetaHuman-based skeleton for the body and the face archetype along with the skeletal meshes for the tops, bottoms, and shoes.

8
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The Common folder also contains the face and body control rigs, the IK Retargetor assets, the FacePose library, and shared materials and textures.

9
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The folder with the name of the MetaHuman that was added to the project will contain assets that are unique to that character.

10
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Something to note is that it is not recommended to rename the MetaHuman's folder or move assets from existing folders such as the Common folder as they are referenced by other assets.

11
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You can however duplicate assets and move or rename those copies if you wish.

12
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now let's jump into Unreal Engine and start exploring how all of these assets are brought together inside of the MetaHuman Blueprint.

13
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Inside of Unreal Engine, in the viewport, we have the MetaHuman that we created from the RealityCaptureFaceScan data.

14
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In the Content folder, let's navigate to the MetaHuman's folder and locate the folder for this character.

15
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This character is named RCScan01 and I have added CQ to indicate that this was downloaded with the Cinematic Quality settings.

16
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
When we open up this folder, we will see the blueprint for this character. I will double click on this to open it.

17
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Inside of the MetaHuman Blueprint, by default the Event Graph will be visible.

18
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Over here we have the Construction script and over here we have the viewport where we can see our character.

19
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Every MetaHuman has their own blueprint consisting of skeletal mesh components for the body, the feet, the legs, the torso, and the face.

20
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Attached to the face are the groom components which are the eyelashes, the peach fuzz, the eyebrows, the hair, the mustache, and the beard.

21
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Then there is the MetaHuman component which was added in Engine version 5.4 and this allows users to turn on and off animation features for each LOD

22
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and the LOD Sync component which controls and synchronizes the switching of MetaHuman LODs.

23
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Each of these components will have their own unique properties that will appear inside of the Details panel.

24
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now before we move on, let's do a quick review of the MetaHuman Blueprint.

25
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Every MetaHuman has its own blueprint consisting of the following components.

26
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The skeletal mesh components include the body, feet, legs, torso, and face.

27
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The groom components include the hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, peach fuzz, mustache, and beard.

28
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.000
There is also the MetaHuman component which allows you to turn on and off animation features for each LOD and the LOD Sync component which controls and synchronizes the switching of MetaHuman LODs.

29
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The construction script and event graph contain dedicated functions for ARKit and animation retargeting setups that can be customized.

30
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Now let's take a closer look at each of the MetaHuman components.
