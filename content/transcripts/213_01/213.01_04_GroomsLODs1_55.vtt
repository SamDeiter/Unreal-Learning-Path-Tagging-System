00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
We have just finished looking at the skeletal mesh components and will now move on to the

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.460
groom components and dive into the groom asset editor.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.460
Then we will look at the LOD sync and metahuman component.

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.019
Now let's jump back into Unreal Engine and begin exploring the groom components.

5
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.740
Back inside of Unreal Engine, I have opened up the blueprint for Lena CQ from the metahuman

6
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.299
introduction course.

7
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.899
I will use this blueprint as I go through the groom components.

8
00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.000
The groom components are children of the face component as they follow the head.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.399
The components include the eyelashes, peach fuzz, the eyebrows, the hair, the mustache

10
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.859
and the beard.

11
00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.100
When looking at the groom components, we will see that even though this metahuman does not

12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.099
have a mustache or beard, those groom components will serve as placeholders for those assets.

13
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:15.200
When we select the hair component in the details panel, each groom asset comes with its own

14
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.140
material instance and depending on the style, it will have one for the hair, the helmet

15
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140
and carts.

16
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.420
If we open this material instance, there will be a number of parameters you can adjust

17
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.019
to control the appearance of the hair without ever having to open the master material.

18
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:45.180
Now if we go back to the metahuman blueprint, right below the materials, we will have a

19
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.260
groom asset and groom binding asset.

20
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.060
The binding asset is used to attach and skin a groom component to a skeletal mesh.

21
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.740
If importing your own custom groom, ensure you assign the skeletal mesh that this groom

22
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.340
should be bound to in the groom binding asset.

23
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.099
Let's open up this groom asset and dock it here.

24
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.579
With the groom asset editor, we can manage aspects of our groom, such as how the groom

25
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:28.419
is rendered, how it handles physics simulation and manages LODs.

26
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:34.299
Starting with the LOD panel, this is where we can control the switch between LODs based

27
00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.939
on screen size in the viewport and specify what type of geometry it should switch to.

28
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:49.979
For example, for this groom, LOD0 uses strands and LOD1 uses strands.

29
00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.939
For LOD2 and 3, it uses cards.

30
00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.060
Next, we have the interpolation panel.

31
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.020
Interpolation defines how groom curves should move with respect to skinning and physics

32
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.979
simulation.

33
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:15.019
For large skeletal mesh deformations and simulation, when RBF interpolation is enabled, it will

34
00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.899
help to preserve the original groom's position, regardless of the physics simulation and deformation.

35
00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:27.099
Next, we have the strands panel.

36
00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.819
This controls the rendering properties related to the strand geometry.

37
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.459
It can be used to control physical properties of the hair, such as the hair tip scale, for

38
00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.500
example, which can make the hair look finer if the value is set to a lower number.

39
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.539
Next, we have the cards panel.

40
00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:53.979
This is where you can set up the card geometry and specify if you want the engine to generate

41
00:03:53.979 --> 00:04:01.099
cards procedurally or if you want to import your own cards.

42
00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.780
The Meshes panel manages the mesh geometry that is used for LODs.

43
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.299
When LODs switch for the grooms, they go from strands to cards to meshes.

44
00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.680
And this is where you can manage those assets.

45
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.459
The Materials panel is where you define what materials are used by the groom asset.

46
00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:31.779
The Physics panel is where you can enable or disable physics simulation and control

47
00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:40.659
the simulation properties, such as the external forces, the bend, stretch, and collision constraint,

48
00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.620
and strand parameters.

49
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.539
Now before we move on, let's do a quick review of what we just covered.

50
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.379
If we open up a groom asset, we can use the groom asset editor to adjust a variety of

51
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.420
properties.

52
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.780
The LOD panel is where we can control and configure what the groom switches to for each

53
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.860
LOD by setting the visibility, screen size, and geometry types that are used.

54
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.820
For example, strand based grooms may perform poorly when using multiple metahumans at the

55
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.379
highest LOD setting.

56
00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:27.300
By changing the geometry to use cards or meshes, this will boost performance.

57
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.480
If you want to force card based geometry for all hair grooms instead of strands when working

58
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.920
in a level, you can use the console variable shown on the bottom right.

59
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.180
The interpolation panel is used to control how a groom's curves should move with respect

60
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.900
to the skinned meshes and physics simulation when a groom is bound to a skeletal mesh and

61
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.240
skinning is used for deformation.

62
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.319
During deformation and physics simulation, RBF interpolation is what preserves the original

63
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.180
groom shape.

64
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.639
By disabling this, the groom will use the local skin rigid transform it is bound to.

65
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.779
And disabling this may come in handy if for instance, the eyebrows on your metahuman

66
00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:21.159
begin to flutter even when there is no animation applied.

67
00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.159
The strands panel is where we can control the rendering properties related to the strand

68
00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.699
geometry of a groom.

69
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:35.719
Some of those properties include the hair width, root scale, and hair tip scale.

70
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.040
The hair shadow density reduces or increases the amount of shadow on the groom as we can

71
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.020
see on the images on the right.

72
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.540
We can decrease the amount to help with flickering hair shadows and transmission.

73
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.400
The cards panel is where you can set up your card geometry and textures and specify if

74
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.200
you want the engine to procedurally generate them or to import your own.

75
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.839
The meshes panel is where you can set the mesh, textures, and mapping to specific hair

76
00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.399
grooms and LODs.

77
00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:16.879
And the materials panel is where you can define what materials are used by a specific groom

78
00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.639
asset.

79
00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:25.079
And finally, the physics panel is where you can enable or disable physics simulation and

80
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:30.800
the simulation properties of things such as the external forces, collision, and strand

81
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.639
parameters.

82
00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.399
Keep in mind that some groom assets will have more than one solver setting, so if you wish

83
00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:44.959
to disable simulation for a groom asset, you may want to scroll down and check that you

84
00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:49.680
have disabled it in the additional solver settings.

85
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.479
Now that we have a better understanding of the groom component and have also looked at

86
00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:00.159
the groom asset editor, let's jump back into Unreal Engine and now take a look at the

87
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.680
LOD sync component.
