00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060
Now, let's wrap up our course with some resources that you may find helpful when working with

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.660
metahumans.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.839
When rendering image sequences with metahumans, the following console variables can assist

4
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
with high quality renders.

5
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.600
Feel free to take a snapshot of these.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.400
You do not have to use all of them at the same time, as they each have their own use,

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.960
which depends on several factors.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.600
For example, the Hairstrands Holdout Mode console variable can be helpful if using Movie Render

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000
Graph.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.079
This will apply the Hairstrand separation to the Holdout node for creating better alpha

11
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.640
layers for compositing.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.519
Finally, all of the resources and links to some of the tools discussed today can be found

13
00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.480
by following the URLs on this slide.

14
00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:04.239
Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference.

15
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.239
This brings us to the end of the Metahuman Blueprints and Animation course.

16
00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:14.459
I want to thank you for spending your time with me, and I hope these videos help you

17
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.879
as you continue working with metahumans in Unreal Engine.
