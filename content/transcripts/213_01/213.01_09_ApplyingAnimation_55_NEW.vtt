1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
Let's begin by going over how we can apply animations to metahumans with and without

2
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.080
sequencer.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.519
Then we will take a look at the bodyik retargetor assets and facial animation tools that are

4
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.620
already set up to work with metahumans.

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.560
We previously saw how we can apply existing body and facial animations to our metahumans

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.679
in sequencer.

7
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.960
Once added to a level sequence, we delete the default control rigs, then use the plus

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.719
sign on either the face or body component to add an animation track.

9
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.280
There may be cases where you want to quickly visualize a body or face animation without

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.679
opening up a level sequence.

11
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.480
So let's jump into Unreal Engine for a moment and see how we can apply an animation to a

12
00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.879
metahuman without using sequencer.

13
00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.519
In Unreal Engine, with our metahuman selected in the level, if we go to the details panel,

14
00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:14.679
we can select if we want to apply an animation to the body or face component by simply selecting

15
00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.920
that component.

16
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.920
Right below in the animation setting, we can change the animation mode from use animation

17
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.640
blueprint to use animation asset.

18
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.280
And over here, we can apply an animation sequence to the body.

19
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.439
I will search for mh body animation and select it.

20
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.200
To see the animation play from this camera position, we can go up here to the play and

21
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.159
editor options and select simulate.

22
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.480
Our animation will start to play in the viewport.

23
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.640
And this will allow us to quickly visualize a body animation on our metahuman without

24
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.760
using sequencer.

25
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:12.159
I'm going to press stop and select the metahuman again and go back to the body component and

26
00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.000
I will clear the animation asset from here.

27
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.800
And then reset the animation mode back to use animation blueprint.

28
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.079
Now let's review the steps we just covered before moving on.

29
00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.879
We can apply animation sequences to either the body or face component by changing the

30
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.639
animation mode to use animation asset.

31
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.759
With this setting, we can select any animation we want to apply to a metahuman.

32
00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:53.159
Then we can change the play and editor setting to simulate and view the animation in the

33
00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.799
viewport without having to open up sequencer.

34
00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.239
Just remember when you are done to clear the animation sequence and reset the animation

35
00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.959
mode.

36
00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.039
Now let's return to Unreal Engine and take a look at the body ik retargetor assets we

37
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:17.000
can use with metahumans.

38
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.399
In Unreal Engine, to locate the ik retargetor assets, inside of the metahumans folder, go

39
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:33.719
to the common folder, then to the other common folder, then inside of the animation folder

40
00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.039
is the retargeting folder.

41
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.239
Here we will find retargeting assets.

42
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.280
Over here we have an ikrig asset for each of the metahuman body proportions that we

43
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.280
have brought into this project.

44
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.120
If I open this up, we can see on the right that all of the joints have been mapped out

45
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.040
as chains.

46
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.439
So for example, spine 1 to spine 5 makes up the spine chain.

47
00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:10.400
Now let's go back and open up the ik retargetor asset.

48
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.079
Inside of here we have a source and a target.

49
00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:21.199
Our source has the existing animation curves we want to transfer to our character which

50
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.240
is the target.

51
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.319
On the bottom right we can see the animation curves are transferred from the source to

52
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.399
the target by matching the bone chains.

53
00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:39.079
We can do a lot more things with the ikrig and retargetor assets.

54
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:44.680
Let's go back and look for the animation blueprint retargetor asset and then open this

55
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.319
up.

56
00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:55.480
In the animation graph, if we select the retarget post from mesh node, in the details panel

57
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.680
we can see the ikretargetor asset is assigned.

58
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.319
This allows us to stream in live motion capture data and transfer source data to our target

59
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:14.400
while using the ikretargetor tools to make adjustments in real time.

60
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.879
Let's do a quick review before we move on.

61
00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:28.000
Animations can be animated using real time or offline animation retargeting workflows.

62
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.560
Retargeting involves transferring animation curves from one skeleton to another.

63
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.639
Unreal Engine 5 uses ikrigs and ikretargetor setups which involve mapping out joints to

64
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:49.399
bone chains and then transferring animation curves from the source to a target by matching

65
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.239
the bone chains.

66
00:05:52.239 --> 00:06:00.560
Meta humans are also set up to work with facial animation tools.

67
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.479
Facial animation tools that meta humans can be used with include LiveLink face, Meta

68
00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.919
Human Animator and Audio Driven Animation.

69
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.519
LiveLink face is a real time facial animation tool allowing you to bring your meta human

70
00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:23.919
to life instantly in Unreal Engine and uses up to 52 ARKit control curves.

71
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.439
Meta Human Animator is an offline facial animation tool using over 200 control curves

72
00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:37.039
to produce high quality facial animation data by utilizing depth footage from an iPhone

73
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.560
or vertical stereo HMC.

74
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.199
Audio driven animation allows you to process audio in order to produce realistic facial

75
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.519
animations and all of these tools are available to use for free with your Epic Games account.

76
00:06:54.519 --> 00:07:00.240
It is worth mentioning that because Meta humans use a shared skeleton for the body and for

77
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:08.279
the face you can easily transfer animations from one project to another or from older

78
00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.159
engine versions to new ones.

79
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:19.439
Let's jump into Unreal Engine and take a look at this process.

80
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:26.880
In the source files folder of this course there is a body animation sequence UAssetFile.

81
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.840
If you wish to transfer Meta Human Animation Sequences from one project to another or from

82
00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:43.319
older engine versions to newer ones, in File Explorer copy the UAssetFile you wish to transfer.

83
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:50.719
Then select a folder you wish to add it to by right clicking on that folder and selecting

84
00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:53.279
Show in Explorer.

85
00:07:53.279 --> 00:08:00.039
Then paste it in the desired File Explorer folder of your Unreal Engine project.

86
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.760
The animation sequence asset will appear in your project.

87
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:13.040
Now let's review the steps we just completed.

88
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.480
We have just seen how we can easily add Meta Human Animation Sequence UAssetFiles to Unreal

89
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.120
Engine projects.

90
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.320
Simply copy the animation sequence UAssetFile from File Explorer then inside of your Unreal

91
00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:36.840
Engine project select any folder you wish to add it to and right click on that folder

92
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.980
and select Show in Explorer.

93
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:47.639
Then paste the UAssetFile into the File Explorer folder of your Unreal Engine project.

94
00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:52.559
Since there have been changes to the Meta Human Skeletons in newer versions of Unreal

95
00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:59.859
Engine you may be prompted to assign this newly added animation sequence to the face

96
00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:08.119
archetype for facial animations and the Meta Human Base Skeleton for the body animations.

97
00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:13.479
Now that we have touched on some of the ways we can apply animations to Meta Humans let's

98
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:20.000
move on to the next section of this course where we explore the optimized Meta Humans

99
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.320
that we can download from Quixel Bridge.
