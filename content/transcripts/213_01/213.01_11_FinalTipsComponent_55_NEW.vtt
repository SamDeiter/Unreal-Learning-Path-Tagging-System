00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
In this section of our course, I will share some final recommendations, providing tips

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.040
and resources for you to use as you continue your training with MetaHumans.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.160
We will look at ways we can approach making adjustments to MetaHuman components and how

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.320
we can make adjustments to our project render settings and environment when working with

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.760
MetaHumans in a level.

6
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.960
As we have seen throughout this course, we can make a variety of customizations to MetaHuman

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
components, their properties and assets.

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.240
Let's jump into Unreal Engine and take a look at a few simple adjustments we can make when

9
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.040
working with MetaHumans in a project.

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.320
Inside of Unreal Engine, let's begin making adjustments to MetaHuman components by first

11
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.799
going to our course topics folder and open the folder named Final Output.

12
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:08.159
Here we will find a cinematic sequence that contains various cameras along with a body

13
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.560
and facial animation.

14
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.439
I am going to double click on this to open it and now I will play the sequence.

15
00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.920
To view this from the different cameras, click here on the Camera Cuts track.

16
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.719
Now I want to pause the sequence right here.

17
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.280
If for example we would like to make adjustments to the roughness of the skin, we can do this

18
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.879
inside of the skin material instance.

19
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:40.400
Let's select our MetaHuman in the viewport.

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.960
Then in the Details panel, select the face component and then go here and double click

21
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.520
on this.

22
00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:55.199
To open up the material instance, I will double click on this.

23
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:59.560
Inside of here we have several parameters we can adjust.

24
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.959
For example, the artist delights allow us to control the makeup properties.

25
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.199
To adjust the roughness, I will scroll all the way down here and open up the roughness

26
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.359
parameters.

27
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.560
We can adjust the minimum and maximum roughness values and this will affect the roughness

28
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.960
on the entire face.

29
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.280
Another thing we can do is uncheck Baked Roughness Modulation over here.

30
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.000
This will unlock all of these parameters allowing us to control the roughness in specific areas

31
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.840
of the face.

32
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.920
If for instance we would like to reduce the roughness in the cheeks, we can lower the

33
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.000
value of the cheek front multiplier to something like .8.

34
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.920
We can do the same to the nose.

35
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.000
Here we can change the nose multiplier to something like .7.

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.199
The face material instance gives us control over even the finest detail.

37
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:12.839
Now let's close these and continue playing the sequence.

38
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:18.759
When we get to the section of the sequence where we can see the teeth, I will press pause.

39
00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:24.759
Here we may want to adjust the way the teeth and light are interacting and we can do this

40
00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.000
with the subsurface profile of the teeth.

41
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.120
I'm going to select the MetaHuman Blueprint in the viewport.

42
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.599
And in the details panel, select the face component.

43
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.240
Over here we can open up the teeth material instance.

44
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.200
The teeth material instance allows us to control things such as the base color of the teeth

45
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.879
and gums and we can also fine tune things such as the teeth and gum roughness.

46
00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.960
Another thing we can do is go down here to the material property overrides and adjust

47
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.319
the subsurface profile.

48
00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.919
By default this will be disabled but I have already enabled this by checking this on.

49
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:18.699
If we open this up, inside of here we can control the way light scatters as it passes

50
00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.040
through semi-translucent surfaces such as the teeth and gums.

51
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.920
For example, the Mean Free Path Color controls how far light goes into the subsurface of

52
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.840
the red, green and blue channel.

53
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.640
If we change the red to something like 0.19 we can see that the teeth and gums become

54
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000
more translucent.

55
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.200
The Mean Free Path Distance controls the distance that the Mean Free Path Color goes

56
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.120
into subsurface.

57
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.280
So for instance if we change the value to something like 0.19 we can see that the teeth

58
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.879
and gums become even more translucent.

59
00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.800
Let's close these and continue.

60
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.240
I will continue playing the sequence.

61
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.920
When we get to this section here perhaps we want to change the color of the hair.

62
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.280
To do this I will select the metahuman, then go to the Details panel and select the Hair

63
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.360
component.

64
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.960
I will go here and open up the Hair Material instance.

65
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.040
Here we have a variety of parameters we can adjust.

66
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.520
For example we can adjust the Hair Melanin parameter.

67
00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:49.759
If I change this value to something like 0.5 we can see the hair color changes.

68
00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.000
We can also adjust the roughness and control the way hair and light interact.

69
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.120
Depending on the hairstyle we can also control properties such as the highlights and ombre.

70
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.839
These are a few simple adjustments we can make just through the material instances of

71
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.560
the metahuman components.

72
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.639
Now before we move on let's review what we just covered.

73
00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.560
Something to note is that many of the selections we have made in the metahuman creator to things

74
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:33.000
such as the color of the eyes, the hair and some of the skin details can also be modified

75
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.199
in engine with the component material instances.

76
00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:44.120
We have control over even the finest details such as the roughness for specific areas of

77
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.879
the face by unchecking the baked roughness modulation setting.

78
00:06:52.879 --> 00:07:00.319
We can also control how light scatters as it passes through translucent and semi-translucent

79
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:07.839
surfaces such as the teeth, skin and eyes with the subsurface profile located in the

80
00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:14.719
material property overrides of these material instances.

81
00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:20.800
We can use the hair material instance to fine tune the appearance of the hair and adjust

82
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.159
things such as color, ombre and highlights.

83
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.480
We can also control the way hair reflections and lighting interact by adjusting the roughness

84
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.720
parameters.

85
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.120
Now there may be cases where we want to make adjustments to a metahuman blueprint while

86
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.280
preserving the original version.

87
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.960
An easy way we can approach this is to make adjustments to a child blueprint of a metahuman.

88
00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:56.159
Let's jump back into Unreal Engine and go over this.

89
00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:02.719
Inside of Unreal Engine with the folder of the metahuman we wish to adjust already opened,

90
00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.240
select the blueprint and then right click on it.

91
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.159
Then select create child blueprint class.

92
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:19.000
Now we can make adjustments to this child metahuman blueprint and those changes will not affect

93
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.480
the original one.

94
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.759
You can open up this child blueprint and make changes such as switch the groom component

95
00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:32.960
asset with a different hairstyle, assign a different animation blueprint to the face

96
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:41.720
or body or even do something as simple as forcing the LOD to something like 3.

97
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:49.560
Now if we go back to our main viewport and drop this into a level we can see the changes

98
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.440
we made are only applied to the child blueprint of this metahuman.

99
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.720
For certain shared assets such as materials those assets will have to be duplicated and

100
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.800
a copy can be assigned and then adjusted otherwise those types of adjustments will affect the

101
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.840
original blueprint.

102
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:18.720
Let's review what we've just covered before we move on.

103
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.120
We have just touched upon how we can approach making changes to a copy of an existing metahuman

104
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.879
blueprint without those changes affecting the original by using a child blueprint.

105
00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:39.840
To create a child blueprint simply right click on the metahuman blueprint and select create

106
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.680
child blueprint class.

107
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.080
From there you can change things such as forcing the LOD to something specific, switching out

108
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.120
the hair grooms or assigning a different animation blueprint to one of the skeletal mesh components

109
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.360
with the exception of shared assets such as materials.

110
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:09.360
Now let's move on to the next section of this course.
