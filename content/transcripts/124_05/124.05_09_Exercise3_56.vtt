00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello and welcome to exercise three using multiple slots.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So in this exercise, we are going to be creating a bit more complicated definition file so

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we can imitate something that might be like a car or something like that.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But where you want to have multiple slots and the different AI would do different things in different slots.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now to start with, I would like you to move to the third slide in the training eight.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's exercise three multiple slots.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And you should see that we have a set up that looks a little bit like this.

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now if I was to simulate, we'd see that all the AI walk around and in the middle there is a bonfire with a guitar.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So what I'm looking to do here is have the characters sit around the bonfire and one of them to play the guitar.

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now if we look through what we have here, we have the BP bonfire itself that we're going to make into the smart object or character and the M underscore play guitar.

11
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If we were to look at the montage for the play guitar.

12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now the interesting bit that we have about this is we are using a specific bone here called the interaction.

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And the way I'm going to animate that is I have put together this animation with the guitar on the interaction button.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And that means when the character comes in and picks it up, it will use the the transform of the interaction boat in order to know the location for the boat.

15
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And this means that we can just pick it up and put it down and it will sync with the animation.

16
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You'll also see that at the beginning here we have an a N toggle use object.

17
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And all this is is an animation notifier where I open that up.

18
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We do a couple of things here.

19
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We receive the notifier and I'm getting the owner of the notifier say finding the smart object.

20
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I'm saving a couple of variables on the smart object.

21
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A variable Boolean saying play guitar and a variable save of the skeleton mesh.

22
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That's all I need in order to get this up and running.

23
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's relatively straightforward.

24
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can go in and look at it.

25
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's not the best example.

26
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But what I want to concentrate on in this example is putting together a more complicated definition.

27
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So let's do that now.

28
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What I would like you to do is right hand click.

29
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And again, we're going to come up to miscellaneous and we are looking for data asset.

30
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Once we select data asset, I'm going to search for smart and you can see we have a smart object definition here.

31
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I will select that and I'm going to call this smart object definition underscore bonfire.

32
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then double click to open this up.

33
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now to start off with we have no slots.

34
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So we're going to want to add some slots in, but it's a little hard to place the slots down when we don't know what the object looks like.

35
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Luckily, we have a preview settings up here.

36
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So I'm going to come up to the preview settings and under the object actor class, I am going to search for BP underscore bonfire.

37
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm going to select the bonfire.

38
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And now we can see we have our guitar and our bonfire.

39
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this will help us to add in the different sockets.

40
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now the first socket I would like to add.

41
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I want this one to be the one where we have the guitar player in it.

42
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm going to drag this over to the right hand side.

43
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I already have played around with this and I reckon the offset needs to be about 190.

44
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I also want to rotate it.

45
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
880 degrees.

46
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So it's facing back towards the center.

47
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Now that's good so far.

48
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now next up.

49
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It doesn't matter so much where these slots are.

50
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that's because we we don't have to line it up as long as it's on the floor.

51
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It shouldn't make much difference.

52
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in a few different slots.

53
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And see they always appear in the middle.

54
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm going to rotate them so that they face in.

55
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So I'm actually just going to put them all in place first.

56
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I'm not going to make it too even.

57
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And I'm just going to grab all of these and rotate them so that they're facing the fire.

58
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
OK, so that's given us six slots here for people to be gathered around the fire.

59
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Now they're all called none.

60
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm going to jump on the first one.

61
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I'm going to rename this to guitar.

62
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Because this is the only one that we're going to do something slightly different with.

63
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Now we need to set up the behavior.

64
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So I'm going to come in here and I'm going to select the index.

65
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I'm going to come down to gameplay behavior smart object.

66
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And in the drop down, I'm just going to be looking for exercise three so that DBC underscore sitting down exercise three.

67
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Now drop down again.

68
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We have a default of sitting on the floor.

69
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
That's fine.

70
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So as long as those are up, that's for our default.

71
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So all of the slots are going to have that.

72
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But in the guitar one, we want to override that.

73
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So under the behavior definitions, I'm going to hit plus.

74
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I'm going to select the game pay behavior smart object definition.

75
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Another drop down.

76
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Again, I'm going to select game pay configuration sitting down.

77
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I want the option to play guitar.

78
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Okay, and with that done, we can now come in and open up our bonfire.

79
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We need to add in our smart object.

80
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And we need to set that to bonfire.

81
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
You look at the viewport.

82
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We can see now that the guitar one is pointing towards the guitar and everything looks okay.

83
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So if we come back into the level here, we select this.

84
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We can actually see the spots.

85
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And if I press simulate, you can now see that some of the characters sit around.

86
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But the one that is in the slot with the guitar is going to start playing the guitar as soon as it's there.

87
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And that brings us to the end of our final exercise video.

88
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Hopefully you may get that all working.

89
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Thank you very much.
