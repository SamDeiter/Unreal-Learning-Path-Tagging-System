00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Hello and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.960
For this video, we are going to be doing the code for the use smart object task.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:23.400
So what I would like you to do is open up the STT underscore use smart object.

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.920
And for this, like the previous task, we have the files it's up mostly already.

5
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.160
We have automatically overridden the end state task here.

6
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.640
And we have two comment boxes so that I know what we're supposed to be putting in.

7
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.000
And in the variables, we have the context so we can easily get hold of it and an input

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for the claim hand.

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.120
Right.

10
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.959
So the first thing we're going to want to do is check to see the claim handle is valid.

11
00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.120
I'm going to drag in the claim handle and get it.

12
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:16.479
Then the drag off just type is valid.

13
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.680
Again this is giving us a is valid output Boolean pin.

14
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.920
So I am going to hold down the letter B to create a branch and lug that in.

15
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.080
If it's false, we want to finish the task but with a failure.

16
00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:52.759
And on true, we are going to move to that smart object and use it.

17
00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.480
In order to move to it, the instruction we need to provide to the AI controller.

18
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.599
So we have in our context here a reference to our AI controller.

19
00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.280
So I'm going to grab that.

20
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.280
And then I'm going to show right off and search for move to and use.

21
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.599
And you can see that's going to give us the option to move to and use the smart object

22
00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.599
with gameplay behavior.

23
00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.199
And that's the one that we want.

24
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.560
So I will now like this in.

25
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.280
Now at this point, what this is going to do is going to tell the AI to walk to wherever

26
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640
the smart object is.

27
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.000
And once it's got there, it is going to hand over control to the game.

28
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.680
So this is where we fundamentally leave the state trip.

29
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.639
However, we still need a finished task.

30
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.920
So I am going to drive off succeeded.

31
00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:09.799
And then I'm going to search for finished task.

32
00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.239
And I'm going to with it selected press control D to duplicate it.

33
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:24.199
So I'm going to do a failed on both the on fail and the move to fail.

34
00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.279
So this is two tasks.

35
00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:31.919
First, it's going to move and then it's going to play the gameplay by the on fail would

36
00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:39.399
be the failure of the game by the and the on move to fail would be that moved.

37
00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:46.719
And the final thing was to do here to make sure we have the input from the flame handle

38
00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.000
connected up to the move and control.

39
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.919
So this is where it's going to find the gameplay behavior.

40
00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.439
And that is all we need to do.

41
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.520
All of the rest of the work will be done in the game behavior.

42
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.560
And we'll do that in the next video.

43
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.319
That brings us to the end of the quick video.

44
00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.560
Next up is going to be a bit of a long one because we are going to need to set up gameplay

45
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560
behavior.
