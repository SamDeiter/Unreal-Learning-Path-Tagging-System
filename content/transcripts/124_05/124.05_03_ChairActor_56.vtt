00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
Hello and welcome to this video, we're going to be carrying on the exercise here and all

2
00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:14.120
we're going to be doing is we are going to be creating the smart object actor itself

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.080
and connecting everything up to it.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.920
So for this smart object itself, we can actually select any class which is below the actor,

5
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.480
but for this we're just going to be working with an actor direct.

6
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.480
We're going to call this BP Chair.

7
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.040
I double clicked and open this up.

8
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.840
You'll see we have a standard actor here and we're going to need a couple of odds and

9
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.520
salts in this.

10
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.160
First thing that we're going to need is the static mesh itself.

11
00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:02.919
So if I come in here and I search for static mesh in the components, see we have a static

12
00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:03.919
mesh.

13
00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:08.319
Then I'm going to call this SM underscore chair.

14
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:16.479
To call this static mesh, I'm going to search for the same one SM underscore chair, then

15
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.679
you should see that we have this chair here.

16
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.160
Okay, so we have our physical representation.

17
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.200
Now I'm going to add in a couple more things.

18
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.520
First thing I'm going to add in is a box collision.

19
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.920
And this isn't a necessity, but what you will find when you are working with smart objects

20
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.120
is that we have a little bit of a challenge often with collisions in order to get the

21
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.079
static mesh to sit cleanly onto a chair.

22
00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.840
At some point, some collision needs to be turned off.

23
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.800
And in this case, we can turn off the collision on the chair itself.

24
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.879
And I only had a collision find it, just so it's a very small collision.

25
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.599
I'm going to scale down here.

26
00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.599
I'm going to use this as a method of preventing other people from walking through the chair

27
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.919
as it's going on.

28
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:29.840
So if you can do that, that just means that we can turn off the collision on the chair

29
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.680
and it will, and it, and our navigation is still, is going to be infected.

30
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680
Okay.

31
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.200
So let us jump in for this collision.

32
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.760
We need to change the collision preset because these are set by default to overlap dynamic.

33
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.400
And we want to put it down to block all.

34
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.920
So that gives us our back collision.

35
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.600
Go helping with that.

36
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.560
Now what I'm going to add is our smart object component.

37
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.640
You can see here, it is down here on the, as we're going through, smart object here.

38
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.680
So in our smart object, we need to provide it with a smart object definition.

39
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.199
And you can see that we have our chair, smart object definition chair.

40
00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.480
So we're going to use that on that.

41
00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:37.959
Now I'd like to actually put this in place, but we have not fully set up our smart object

42
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:38.959
definition.

43
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.519
So I'm going to double click and open this up.

44
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.959
So here we are in our smart object definition for chair.

45
00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.159
And I know we can do a more advanced one in the second exercise.

46
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.399
For this, I would just like you to add in the Sundiana slot.

47
00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.799
So you can see at the top here, we have had slot.

48
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.840
And you can see that this is going to have none below it here.

49
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.040
But what we want to do is we want to connect up the default behavior definition to the

50
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.640
push pride and do a drop down.

51
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.840
We go work with the gameplay behavior smart object definition and a third one down here.

52
00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:32.959
We're going to do the drop down and we're going to go with the GBC sitting down.

53
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.799
So that's everything there connected up.

54
00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:43.079
What we should see when we go back to our BP chair, so you can now see that we have

55
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.439
our slot is visible.

56
00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.479
Now I'm going to move it a little bit further forward.

57
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.800
But until we get the animation running, it's going to be a little bit hard for us to figure

58
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.439
out where this slot needs to be.

59
00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.560
So I will leave that as it is all the time being.

60
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.319
Now there's one more thing that's let's do with this chair.

61
00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.920
And that's to add a interface.

62
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.200
So we've always point you should have used interfaces quite a lot.

63
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.439
They define a method for us to communicate between actors without having to know necessarily

64
00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.759
what the actor is.

65
00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.199
Before this interface, I'm going to come to class settings and implement interfaces.

66
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:37.159
I'm going to search for BP smart object interfaces.

67
00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.680
And with that, we will be we will be given a couple of functions that we can override

68
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.519
down here that we would do when we get to the coding side of this.

69
00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:56.039
With that, I will save and comply and I can drive each chair into the world.

70
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.399
So we'll finish the video there.

71
00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.079
In the next one, we're going to be doing some of the actual coding.
