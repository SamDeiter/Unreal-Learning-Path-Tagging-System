00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
Hello and welcome to this video where we will be jumping into the engine and starting off

2
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.560
some of our exercises.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.000
Before we start there is a project file which comes with this course.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.440
I highly recommend that you download it.

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.600
This course is designed to be a follow along and this really helps to make sure that you

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.480
know how to set everything up and have some hands on experience working with it.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.719
Now there are a few plugins that you might want to have turned on or who are actually

8
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.920
required some of them if you want to use smart objects.

9
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.359
In the project that we are downloading these plugins should already be turned on so you

10
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.719
don't need to worry about setting them up and restarting them but I would like to go

11
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.520
over them here.

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.000
So to start off with we have the smart object plugin and this is what will allow us to set

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
up and use the smart objects.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
The second one is the AI behavior.

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.879
Now the smart object system doesn't necessarily use the AI behavior system but it is recommended

16
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:18.120
and this is the system that we are going to be using in all of our examples.

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.240
It is a modular way of creating behaviors that can be plugged into things like state

18
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.719
trees.

19
00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.880
And in order to get these running in combination with each other there is another plugin that

20
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.719
we are likely to turn on and that's the gameplay behavior smart objects.

21
00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.880
Now these two systems to talk to each other.

22
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.120
Now we are going to use another plugin which again is not necessary but it does really

23
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.120
help when you are trying to tie together animations with specific locations and measures.

24
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.480
And that plugin is motion warping.

25
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.520
What this is going to allow us to do is adjust animations dynamically so that we can have

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.800
things like sitting, vaulting and interacting can line up correctly with the smart objects

27
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.040
and the measures that are within the level.

28
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:23.359
Now with that said let's jump into the project and we will start off by creating the classes

29
00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.639
that are going to be needed.

30
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.599
Now when you've downloaded this project and opened it up you should hopefully get a screen

31
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.840
that looks a little bit like this.

32
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.159
Now we are using something that is called the trained and paid and what this is going

33
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.639
to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to move between the different sections of

34
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.959
the project as we are going through and it's going to highlight the assets that we are

35
00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.479
going to want to be used.

36
00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:58.119
So hopefully this fires up a new start up.

37
00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:04.199
If not under the links first kill this town under the link selection we have the training

38
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.439
paid and that will bring this up.

39
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.879
What I usually recommend is that you take it and you dock it in the top here and ideally

40
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.960
place the heartline below it and if you bring it down so you can just see the top you can

41
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.359
check that you are on the same slide as me and we are in the correct place to teach the

42
00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.840
class.

43
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.039
If you don't have it don't worry too much the level itself isn't too hard to navigate.

44
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:42.439
I am going to jump to the first slide here the example chairs.

45
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.960
One thing you can see is this is brought on my content browser and we are going to be

46
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.879
doing a lot of work in the content browser so I am going to hit the button dock in layout.

47
00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.039
Now you can see that we have it down here.

48
00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:02.400
We are at the exercise one and we can see that we have our files that we are going to

49
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.840
be looking at.

50
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.639
Now at the moment we have one NPC who is in the level if you had a push play he would

51
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.639
do nothing.

52
00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:17.800
Well this is because we have some problems in our state tree and if we have a look at

53
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.439
our state tree chair and I was doing that up as you can see we have a relatively simple

54
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:32.000
state tree and what it is going to do is we have a root and we have seen if we can find

55
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.319
a smart object that is unclaimed and we use that smart object if we can find it.

56
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.199
Now if we do not find the smart object we are going to come down to the part of combat

57
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:53.079
here and wander about and go back to root and after we have come back to root we are

58
00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:57.039
going to check to see if we have a smart object again.

59
00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.560
So it is a straight forward we have two settings we are wandering around with using a smart

60
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.319
object.

61
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:11.439
Now the reason why this is not working is because if we really jump into the tasks you

62
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:17.319
would see that we are lacking a load of code and that is because we are going to add in

63
00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:24.319
this code as part of the exercise so that we can see how it is working.

64
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:32.519
But before we do that we are going to need to create a few different classes.

65
00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:38.319
So the first class that I would like you to make is gameplay behave.

66
00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:45.000
So this is what we are going to run when we actually go in and use the object.

67
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.120
So I am going to come up in here I am going to search for blueprint class and I am going

68
00:05:50.120 --> 00:06:02.359
to search for gameplay behavior and you can see that we have gained by behavior here.

69
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.480
And I will select that and I am going to name this GB for gameplay behavior and sitting

70
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
down.

71
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.639
So we are going to be doing a lot of sitting down.

72
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.199
Okay so that is my first class.

73
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.199
Now the next class that I want is going to be the gameplay behavior config.

74
00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:44.639
If you right hand click again come up to the blueprint class and search for gameplay behavior

75
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.800
config.

76
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.000
See that we have that here and it is a behavior config and we will open that up.

77
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.199
And it goes gameplay and I will rename this GBC under store for sitting down.

78
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.800
So I have gained by behavior config.

79
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.720
So again the gameplay behavior is the actual thing that we are going to do.

80
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.600
The config is the configuration where we can change some of the settings in the gameplay

81
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
behavior.

82
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.080
Now the next thing we are going to do is create a smart object definition.

83
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.400
Now this is slightly different to how we have created the other ones because what we are

84
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.439
actually going to do is right hand click and we are going to be looking into the miscellaneous

85
00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.439
side.

86
00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:51.520
And from this we are going to be selecting a data asset because this is what the definition

87
00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.799
is going to be part of.

88
00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:59.479
So if I search for smart you can see that we have an option for a smart object definition.

89
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:06.759
I am going to select that and I am going to call this smart object definition so sod

90
00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:12.719
and this is going to be for a chair.

91
00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:21.159
I am just going to call that sod chair.

92
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.360
Now we have all the files we need in the next video where we can start setting them up so

93
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.600
that they work in conjunction with each other.
