Hello and welcome, this is the final video as part of our introduction to Smart Objects

2
00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.560
course and I just want to touch on a couple of odds and sorts of future learning that

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.679
you might want to go into from here.

4
00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:27.359
Now we have looked at coding all of the game-paper-havia into a singular script.

5
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.280
Now we don't have to do that, we can actually move over to a secondary state tree.

6
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.879
This we use quite a lot when it comes to Fortnite or Lego, but what this allows us to do is

7
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.879
shift the functionality between different state trees dependent on the object.

8
00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.879
And finally a fantastic video, if you really want to get into this in more depth, is a

9
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.480
talk that was given at Unreal Fest a few years back and that is exploring the new state

10
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
trees for AI.

11
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.200
That was for Unreal Fest 2024.

12
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.879
But you can follow this QR code, should take you directly to it.

13
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.599
Well thank you for sticking with us through that quite long course.

14
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.159
Again this is just an introduction, there is lots more that you can do with Smart Objects

15
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.599
but hopefully this has given you something you can start out with.

16
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.679
Thank you.
