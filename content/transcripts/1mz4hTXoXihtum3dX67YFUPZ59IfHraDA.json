  "text": " No matter where you get your textures for use inside of Unreal Engine 5, whether it's something you've created yourself or something you've downloaded from online or purchased from one of the many online asset stores, you need to make sure that texture adheres to a few rules. The first rule is that no matter what dimension that texture is in the X or the Y-axis, that dimension needs to be a power of 2. That means that the X-axis or the Y-axis needs to be something like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192. Anything from one of those numbers in the X or the Y-axis will give you a texture that will work with Unreal's built-in texture streaming systems. As well as make sure that that texture packs more efficiently into memory. When you import a texture into Unreal, it's going to tell you a number of different things. For example, it'll first tell you the imported size, as well as the streaming method, the size it takes on disk, and the number of MIP maps. Now, MIP map might be a new term to many people, and MIP map is something that Unreal does behind the scenes if your texture meets this power of 2 requirement. MIP maps are level of details for your texture, and they're a way to help reduce your texture's cost when it's viewed in a distance very far away from the camera. We'll cover MIP mapping in the next few slides, but it's important to understand that in order to have this advantage and have Unreal do this work for you, your texture needs to maintain that power of 2 ratio. Let's take a look at the next texture. This next texture, again, imported at 1024 by 1024. Note the method virtual stream. That's right. If we're dealing with virtual textures, no matter if those are streaming virtual textures or runtime virtual textures, we need to ensure that the data we're feeding into there meets this power of 2 requirement. As you can see, we still have a very small resource size because we're using virtual textures and very important number of MIPs 11. The last version of this texture imported 1000 by 1000 method, not streamed. Resource size 512, number of MIPs 1. This is very bad. This means that this particular texture, no matter where we use it or no matter how far away it is from the camera, will always be used at full resolution. And this is going to create a number of different problems, both visually and for performance. Now, in order to check any of your texture settings, we can open up Unreal and by double clicking on a texture like so, we'll open it up inside of the texture editor. And in the details at the top is where all of the settings for this texture should be located.",
