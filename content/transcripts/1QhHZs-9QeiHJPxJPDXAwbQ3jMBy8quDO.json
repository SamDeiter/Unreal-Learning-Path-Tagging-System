  "text": " When you're sculpting your terrain, the standard circle brush is very useful. However, there are going to be instances where we would like to have more control over the brush that is used. In particular, what we would like to do in some instances is actually have a brush that resembles some type of landscape feature, some type of natural feature that we can then use to paint these features or apply these features to our landscape. And we can do this with our brush type being set to alpha and then setting our texture here to an alpha brush that we have imported. Now, before we go any further, let me show you what this actually can do. So if we come over here, look at this. This is alpha brushes in action. So here we have on the left hand side, just that single alpha brush. And we've used that to create this one mountain here. And then if we use a combination of this brush in different areas and click at different strengths, we can actually get something like this that resembles a mountain range. So let's pop over to the editor and see how this works. So first, once I get inside the editor, I'm actually going to come here. I'm going to disable my fog. So it makes things just a little bit easier for us to see. And then I'm going to activate. Well, before I do that, let's just hit control space really quick and make sure that we have this brushes folder and we have our impact craters and our mountain. We did import these at the beginning of our tutorial. But if you haven't, all you need to do is just simply grab these from the folder that accompanies this tutorial and then drag and drop these right into the content browser. You can put them inside of a folder called brushes or you can just leave them in the root of the content folder. That is entirely up to you. With those imported, though, what I'm going to do is come up now to my landscape. And we're going to come over here, make sure that sculpt is selected. And then in our brush type, we're going to change this from our simple circular brush to our alpha brush. When we do that, we're going to get a bunch of different brush settings. So really quickly, we have the texture, which is going to be the T mountain. So we're going to use that and we're going to use this selected asset from content browser. And then underneath this, we have a few other options. So we have our texture channel, which allows us to change the channel that is sampled from. So this means that we can actually store different masks or different textures inside of the R, G, B and alpha channels of a texture to give us more flexibility out of this one texture. For now, though, we're just using the red channel because we only have one mask. We then have our brush size, which is going to control the size of our brush that we edit the landscape with. And you can see it kind of right there. Then we have use clay brush and auto rotate as well as a texture rotation. Now, for us, what we're going to do is I'm actually going to disable these two and I'm going to take my brush here and just bring it all the way up to eighty one ninety two. Now, if we want to go actually a little bit higher, check this out. If I multiply this by four, it's going to give me a really massive brush, which I can't actually get by pulling that all the way to the right hand side there. So you can get a larger brush. You just need to increase this brush size a little bit bigger. Couple of caveats to this, though, once you do that, you might run into instances of your landscape running very slow once you've clicked. So just keep that in mind that the larger your brush goes, the longer it's going to take to process those changes. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to come over to an area like this and we're just going to click. And you're going to see here that I just start to kind of bring up this landscape in various different ways. Now, you can see I'm starting to kind of build up some ridges here. Now, one of the other things that we can do is I am going to turn on my auto rotate here and auto rotate allows you to kind of have this texture rotate itself as it's being dragged along the landscape. And this is really, really, really useful as we are trying to kind of get some different looking data using the exact same stamp. So again, what this is going to do is it's going to allow us to make things look just a little bit more unique and a little less similar to everything else that's going on around it. So you can see here I'm adding some stuff. Let me come over here. So there's my camera bookmark one. You can see by just pressing one or two, I can really quickly get around the map and see where I want to add some of these really awesome looking little mountains here and there. Also remember you can press shift to push stuff down into the landscape as well. So we can get some really cool looking divots as well as some peaks. So what I want everybody to do right now is spend the next few minutes, maybe like two or three minutes, just experimenting with this and brushes of various strength and size and go ahead and try to fill out some of your landscape here with this brush tool, allowing you to again add some really interesting features. Now, once we have finished adding some features with the alpha brush, the next thing that I want to talk about is the pattern brush. Now, the pattern brush works in a similar way. We assign a texture which we can then display across our entire landscape and then use that to affect the highs and the low of our landscape. So in this case, what we're going to do is we're going to take this image right here, which is some craters, and we are going to again go back to our sculpt tool. But instead of our alpha, we're going to click on our pattern and then we're going to assign this crater texture to it. There are going to be some similar parameters in this tool like we saw in the alpha tool, but there's also going to be some things that are a little bit different. Primarily the world space, origin, center texture on origin, and repeat size. What these allow us to do is control how this particular texture is laid across our landscape. And what I mean by that is, well, here we have an example. If you can't see this laid out on your landscape, we can switch over to lighting only. And then you'll actually be able to see this is that texture right there. So what happens when we go to paint this is we're going to get something like this. So we're going to get these craters that indent into the ground and we can actually paint this across our entire landscape. So let's go ahead and look at this in action. So back over in the editor, I'm going to hit control space to come over to my impact craters, and I'm going to put those as our texture here. And there we go. So let's and we might need to do some stuff here. So we are going to turn off our auto rotation. Oh, and I'm on the wrong thing here. I need to click on the pattern brush. There we go. My pattern brush. And that is more like it. So we're going to bring this to use world space. We're going to set the repeat size here to 8192. And for having a little problem seeing it, so I'm going to come over here to detail lighting. And there we go. We can see this just a little bit better here. So if I was to click on this and we'll come back over here to just our regular lit mode, you can see there are the little divots or the little craters that it made. And you can see it's actually made it across the entire landscape. So if we were to come here and I don't know, maybe like increase or make this repeat size a little bit larger and come over to an area like this and click, you're going to see that the holes are going to get a lot bigger. So you see here I have some really big impacts. And then if I was to take this repeat size and shrink this down, I'm going to get these much smaller little holes right there. So very, very cool stuff going on right there. So again, like with our last texture input, our alpha brush, I want everybody to spend the next few minutes just adjusting the rotation, the repeat size and the brush size and then coming through and painting on your landscape here to see the effects that this was. And you can see the effects that this will have on your landscape.",
