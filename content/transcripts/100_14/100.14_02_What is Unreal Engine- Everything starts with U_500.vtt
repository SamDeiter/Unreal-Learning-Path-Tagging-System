00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960
So what is Unreal Engine?

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.520
The best way to start thinking about this is that everything starts with you.

3
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.760
Inside of Unreal we have something called a U project, which is the project that you

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.600
will load to create your Unreal Engine project.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.140
In Unreal Engine's content browser we have assets that are named U assets and essentially

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.980
anything that starts with U is centralized from Unreal Engine.

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.300
So in Unreal Engine we create projects.

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.780
This will house any of your interactive cinematic animation driven experiences.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.860
We create projects from these files so that you can access all the individual information

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.900
within these projects.

11
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.320
Unreal Engine is also made up of editors, tools and systems.

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.960
So whether it be an animation editor or a cinematic editor, maybe you're trying to

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.680
do some real time lighting information.

14
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.580
Essentially we're using multiple different types of inbuilt tools and editors to create

15
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.560
these projects from.

16
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.080
It also manages assets and logic so Unreal Engine can house the raw data that you bring

17
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.960
in from external packages and creates U asset from it and that's what we'll use to build

18
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.600
our projects with.

19
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.220
And when we refer to logic we're referring to the visual scripting language and also

20
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.320
the C++ language.

21
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.200
We also can plug extra additional functionality into the engine via a plugin.

22
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.400
So there's many different plugins already supported and you can also code your own plugins,

23
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520
which we'll talk about in a few slides as well.

24
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
Unreal Engine can also package and executable and essentially packaging and executable will

25
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.180
take your project, it'll wrap it up into a file that doesn't require the end user to

26
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.160
have Unreal Engine installed and instead they can load the experience or project, whatever

27
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.600
you've created from an executable.

28
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.560
So when we say Unreal Engine we're not thinking about a car engine in that respect.

29
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.240
It's more like a car assembly line.

30
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.080
It's multiple facets to Unreal Engine throughout the development process that can be used.

31
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.080
So it's not an all-in-one closed system as it were.

32
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.320
It's more like a continuous assembly line.

33
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.180
So the main questions we get around when starting with Unreal Engine, what is the difference

34
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
between the project editor versus the engine?

35
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.680
So the engine holds all the systems and tools.

36
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.680
It processes the information that's sent to it behind the scenes and it's indirectly

37
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680
used.

38
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.720
The engine is the under the hood stuff that you don't necessarily need to interface with.

39
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
The editor exposes all this powerful functionality.

40
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.080
It visualizes the systems, sub editors and tools to the user.

41
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.460
It allows for asset creation and manipulation.

42
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.240
So when we refer to importing your raw assets into Unreal Engine, whether they be video

43
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.720
files, CAD files, any other 3D asset types, it could be music, it could be a whole host

44
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
of assets.

45
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.040
But you can also create assets directly from Unreal Engine as well.

46
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.600
And it sends information from the project to the engine.

47
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.680
So the project is housing all of your important information that you have for the project

48
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.480
and the engine is presenting that project's information.

49
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.360
And the editor is directly used.

50
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.880
So you will be interfacing with the editor when using Unreal Engine.

51
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.520
So when we talk about projects versus a U project, the project is the self-contained

52
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.200
unit of files.

53
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.520
So whenever you open the editor through the launcher, which we'll be talking about again

54
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.420
in a few slides time, the project will house all of this different information.

55
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.680
So when you install it to your hard drive, you'll see a config folder, a content folder,

56
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.720
which we'll talk about and it includes all the bits that the engine really needs to work.

57
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.920
The U project, however, you'll see at the bottom of this slide, which is the blue icon

58
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.360
on the bottom left hand side, is a specific executable.

59
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.560
It's what you'll use to launch the project and it references all the files within this

60
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560
folder.

61
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.640
So if you think about the example project here as the launcher for the project, it tells

62
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.520
Unreal Engine what content you want to load.

63
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.520
The actual project folder contains all the actual information that you need to have inside

64
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520
that project.

65
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.360
And as we referred to before, everything starts with U. So U asset is just an Unreal Engine

66
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.240
readable file extension.

67
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.640
It's as straightforward as that.

68
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.680
It's any item that you find within the engine, whether you've imported a static mesh, like

69
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.720
you can see in this example, maybe it's been an audio file or a texture, any kind of imported

70
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.040
objects get turned into U assets.

71
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.040
And things that you've made in Unreal, for example, materials, blueprints, any kind of

72
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.520
particle systems, they all become U assets as well.

73
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.200
So most things in the content browser, unless there's some uncompressed raw file, we've

74
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.720
got very few exceptions inside the Unreal Engine.

75
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.280
So more likely than not, you'll see everything coming through as a U asset.

76
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.400
Moving on to the engine launcher.

77
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.520
As promised, we can choose an engine version from the launcher.

78
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.920
So when you first load Unreal Engine, especially when you're wanting to select Unreal Engine

79
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.840
5, multiple different engine versions to choose from, more often than not, you want to pick

80
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.560
the latest engine version that if you're working on a commercial project, you probably want

81
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.000
to use the latest stable engine, not the early access version of the engine.

82
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.280
You have choice over what engine you do install.

83
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.960
And it's also worth noting that everyone on the project should be using the same version

84
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.040
of the engine as well to prevent any conflicts of information or data.

85
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.360
Once you pick an engine version to use, you should stick with that unless everyone updates.

86
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.200
And then when you choose to install the engine, it will give you a series of options, whether

87
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.680
you want to install some additional content, some C++ content, you've got options to kind

88
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.000
of configure your Unreal Engine install there.

89
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Unreal Engine via P4V is the source built version of the engine.

90
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.860
And we follow some internal guides here.

91
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.620
It does require approval from Unreal Engine and it has got global protect on there.

92
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.660
So if you are using Unreal Engine via P4V and instead of via the launcher, you would

93
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.140
expect to see the additional folders here.

94
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.740
And when we're putting our projects on Perforce, when we're storing the projects, all the green

95
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.220
files should be added to the depot.

96
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.680
The green files highlighted here, so you've got the config, content, source, you project,

97
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.760
and then just a preview of the projects image.

98
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.600
Those files all want to add into your repository because everyone can then build the project

99
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.220
based on those files.

100
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.580
The build, derived data cache, intermediate and saved, they're all temporary files that

101
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.500
can be local to that individual's computer.

102
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.980
So the binaries folder is optional.

103
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.020
It's a large file.

104
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.420
Some people want to upload that for posterity to share along the team.

105
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.600
You don't have to do this all the time.

106
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.900
You may find instances where you choose to do that, but the main folders that you do

107
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.700
want to put on Perforce are highlighted in green here.
