00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
So, the first thing we want to do is load our launcher and on the top right hand side

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.520
here you can see launch Unreal Engine and again you can pick the version that you want

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.800
to have there.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
You can go into your library and select the engine version from this tab as well if you've

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.240
not got it installed we can just click plus engine version and you can install a new version

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.040
of Unreal and you can select the drop down options from the engine version selector there.

7
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.440
So I'm just going to go ahead and launch Unreal Engine.

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.040
I've got 5.0.2 here but it's completely up to you which engine version you're using.

9
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.680
Ideally to follow along with this it would be Unreal Engine 5 but the actual 0.2 does

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.980
not matter in this instance.

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.740
So Unreal Engine will initialize and we'll just let it build and compile everything that

12
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.820
it needs to and then we're going to load into a project of our choosing.

13
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.900
So the first screen that we see here will be our recent projects.

14
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.460
We'll have games, film, video, live events and these are all prefabs for your project

15
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.060
to give you some default properties to set up inside your engine so you don't have to

16
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.100
do all the heavy lifting yourself.

17
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.580
For today's example we're going to go over to games.

18
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.380
I'm going to select a third person running game and we're going to keep blueprint selected

19
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
here we don't need the C++ files.

20
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.580
I'm going to choose the target platform as desktop.

21
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.020
I'm going to keep quality preset at maximum and I'm going to maybe include some starter

22
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.500
we want any assets to play with which are 3D meshes or any things like that.

23
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.260
I'll leave ray tracing on tick for now.

24
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.940
If you have a ray tracing enabled computer feel free to enable that but I'm just going

25
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.660
to call this let's call it running game.

26
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.500
Whatever name and convention you go for it's fine.

27
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.780
Generally my project would be okay but we just want to try and avoid any projects that

28
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.260
we're not sure what the actual project would be.

29
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.900
So it's always best to name it something that you intend it to be.

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.860
Project location doesn't matter too much however I would recommend having the projects if you

31
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.020
have an SSD installed on your computer or laptop it's always better to run Unreal Engine

32
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.900
projects off an SSD just because the information is accessed much faster there.

33
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.220
So we'll create this project and we'll let it create everything again Unreal Engine is

34
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.620
going to make certain assumptions for us to get us up and running faster.

35
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.260
We can still manipulate all these settings and we can actually change the game type from

36
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.380
inside the project if we decide that we no longer want it to be a third person template

37
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.100
we can change this inside of Unreal Engine.

38
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.220
However it's just much quicker time of saving of time if you start with the template that

39
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.800
you intend to use.

40
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.340
So you can see we have the engine open here.

41
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.940
First of all we can look around this main scene and we'll go over the UI in more detail

42
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.100
but I'm just going to hold my right mouse button in this viewpoint and I'm going to

43
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.380
press and hold right mouse button and you can see that I can look around here.

44
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.180
I'm going to press and hold left mouse button and I can move forwards backwards and I can

45
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.340
just pan around this scene.

46
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.300
Now I can hold left and mouse right mouse button sorry to move up and down.

47
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.580
So again right mouse button to look around left button to navigate through the scene

48
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.900
and then both mouse buttons to move up and down and you can just get yourself familiar

49
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.980
with this type of navigating the scene.

50
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:08.100
You can also as a quick shortcut hold right mouse button and use W, A, S and D on your

51
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.380
keyboard to navigate through the scene.

52
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.820
So if you're familiar with WASD controls generally found in PC interactive experiences you can

53
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.420
use those to navigate the scene as well.

54
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.380
So we'll go over more detail of the rest of Unreal Engine.

55
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.740
I'm just going to tick that off there and all we really want to do now is just check

56
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.940
how to load up a project and run into the game.

57
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.540
So I'm going to click this big green play button here.

58
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.700
I'm going to click play and you'll see that I'm instantly inside the game.

59
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.660
So I'll click into the screen and you can see that we're running around pressing W and

60
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.820
panning our camera using our mouse and we can press S, we can press A, we can press

61
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.100
D and instantly straight out of the box we've got an example running game.

62
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.940
No coding required just clicking a few buttons to get started.

63
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.780
So that's how powerful Unreal Engine can be just straight out of the box.
