00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
So what we'll do is we'll create a new material just as a little trial just to get

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.240
us used to creating content inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.200
We'll create a shiny material that has a dynamic instance to it and show you how to

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.440
apply that to a mesh inside of Unreal Engine.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.800
So let's jump into our editor and we're going to go to our materials folder.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.280
What I'll do is instead of going into the starter content, I'll just collapse that file

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280
there.

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
I'll click on content and I'm going to right click new folder and I'll just create a folder

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.160
called materials here just to keep things organized.

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.920
You can put your materials folder wherever you'd like and then we want to right click

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.440
in the empty gray space here and we want to select material from the list here, the green

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.060
icon.

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.860
So good naming conventions are always useful to follow whenever you're working in projects.

14
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.340
For materials we like to use the M underscore naming convention and I'll just call this

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:15.220
M underscore base color and I'll hit enter on my keyboard and that will load this up.

16
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.340
So I'm going to get the base color and I'll show you again how to load that in case you've

17
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.900
not been able to load that but I'm just going to get this base color tab and pin that up

18
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.900
there.

19
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.180
Now if you had selected off it before hit and enter, you can just double click the file

20
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940
as well and that will load as well.

21
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.180
So I've just pinned this to the top of my screen here.

22
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm just going to go to file, save all just to make sure everything is always up to date.

23
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.980
Now the first thing we want to do is we want to add color to this material.

24
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.380
So I'm going to hold three on my keyboard and left click and that creates this node here.

25
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.740
I'm going to right click the node, I'm going to convert it to a parameter and I'm going

26
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.260
to spell color the British way here.

27
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.040
So apologies for anyone that I've spelt it wrong for and I'm going to drag out and go

28
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
into base color.

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.300
So I'm just going to get my left mouse button and drag across into base color.

30
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.320
I'm going to save again just to make sure everything's running okay and I want to select

31
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.560
a color for my color.

32
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.200
So let's go to the default value.

33
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.880
Again the details panel is where we're going to be editing a lot of our content.

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.720
So the default value I'm just going to select there on the black and I'm going to pick a

35
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.440
nice value.

36
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.960
Maybe that looks good.

37
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.760
So whatever color you'd like to pick, feel free to pick that and we will give our materials

38
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.480
From our workshop we'll give it a metal value and a roughness value just so we can affect

39
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
these at runtime.

40
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.920
So metal and roughness is where we're going.

41
00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.500
So we'll press number one on the keyboard and left click to create these new nodes.

42
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.660
So before we clicked three and now we're going to click one.

43
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.060
So one into metal and then another one into roughness.

44
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.820
Now I want to right click again the node, convert it to a parameter and I call that

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:28.980
metal and I'm going to right click on this one, convert it to a parameter and call roughness

46
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.860
and you'll see why we're converting these to a parameter.

47
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.560
You'll see before we converted them they still had the same effect and everything would still

48
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.220
work without us converting them but as I save and I've got my basic color set up I'm

49
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.360
going to go into my third person map.

50
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.960
I'm going to navigate just using my left and right mouse buttons here.

51
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.720
I'm going to drag, get my color, drag and drop it onto here.

52
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.360
So you'll see that we've got a shiny material and that's because our metal value if I go

53
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.320
back to my color is zero and the roughness is zero.

54
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.520
And so if I close this now I don't need this editor anymore and I'm going to get this base

55
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.080
color, I'm going to right click on the base color so make sure you're on the base color.

56
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.360
I'm going to create a material instance and I'm just going to select off that.

57
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.060
Now what this has done is it's instanced this material so it's almost like a child.

58
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.480
If you think about this as a parent, this is a child.

59
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.880
I'm going to double click the child and I'm going to tick these three boxes here.

60
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480
I'm going to tick metal, I'm going to tick roughness and I'm going to tick color.

61
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.020
And you'll see that these are the properties that we created parameters for.

62
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.580
So say for example we change the metal to one, it makes it way shinier.

63
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.480
So if I save this and close the material, you'll see that I've got a really shiny version

64
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.700
there and you can just keep creating.

65
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.400
Once you've got the base material set up, you'll see that I can just duplicate this

66
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:22.700
for example, double click it, maybe I change the color of this one, hit okay and save and

67
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.100
maybe I drag and drop that on the floor and you'll see now we've got this orangey color

68
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.660
that's reflecting from the sky.

69
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.140
Now this clearly looks awful and terrible.

70
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.800
I'm just trying to show you the intended result for what you can do with just basic functionality

71
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.500
and then you can edit the content based on those dynamic instances from the main material.

72
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.200
So that's just a quick example of how you might use the material editor inside of Unreal Engine.

73
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100
So that's it for this video.

74
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100
I hope you enjoyed it.
