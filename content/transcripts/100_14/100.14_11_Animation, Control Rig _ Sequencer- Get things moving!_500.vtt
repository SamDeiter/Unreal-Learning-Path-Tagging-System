00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
On the animation, control rig and sequences side, this is essentially how we can get things

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.680
moving inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.280
So the Skeletal Mesh Editor that we were referring to before, all editors can be accessed from

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.440
these editor windows.

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.400
And so this is the mesh layout version of the Skeletal Mesh.

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.520
And you can see that we have settings pertaining to the mesh, such as the materials that the

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.600
Skeletal Mesh is using on the left-hand side there and the material slots.

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.400
You can set the level of detail, which is an LOD.

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.720
Morph targets can be used here and then can be accessed via the editor.

10
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.900
The animation blueprints are the event graph for the logic.

11
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.360
So you can, it's almost like a state machine type setup here, where if you want to transition

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.080
your character from a run to a walk animation, for example, you could do that through the

13
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.560
event graph in the animation blueprint and event graphs for animation.

14
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.360
You can control it and blend the different animations inside of here as well.

15
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.880
Control rig, as I said before, is how you can create tools and controls for animators

16
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600
to animate directly inside of Unreal Engine.

17
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.800
So it is through a plugin, which is automatically on by default.

18
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.440
So you can access this inside of Unreal.

19
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.040
We build automated rig with familiar functionality and you can expose the controls for animators

20
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040
to use.

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.720
It's a very powerful procedural animation tool as well.

22
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.840
And we can also write scripts to automate the workflow.

23
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.600
So we have Python support.

24
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.360
So if you want to use any Python tools, that kind of workflow is exposed to you inside

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.880
of Unreal Engine.

26
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.760
And Sequencer is Unreal Engine cinematic tool where it is essentially a nonlinear animation

27
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
system.

28
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.040
So we can animate assets inside of here.

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.560
We can use control rig assets inside of here to animate as well.

30
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.140
We've got editable tracks, which you can add keys and different data, such as animations

31
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.520
and audio files to.

32
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.040
You have sub sequences, which keep things nice and organized, controllable assets and

33
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.360
the cinematics tool, which you can add cinematic cameras and create different cut scenes, which

34
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.780
you can either then run in real time or you can render out as a pre-rendered video.

35
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.160
Other animation tools to consider here are the retargeting of IK retargeting.

36
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
So if you want to use a series of animations across multiple characters, you can do that

37
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.380
inside of Unreal Engine.

38
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.580
We also have face capture, which is the iOS app for FaceAR, which you can get data and

39
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.300
project that onto your mesh inside of Unreal Engine.

40
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.360
Live link, so any mocap systems you're using, you can create a live link between Unreal

41
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.560
Engine and interface that so you get the data directly into the engine.

42
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.020
And also there's the Alembic geometry cache.
