00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680
We want to create a blueprint pickup and we want to double click the pickup to create

2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.040
some data and to edit.

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.600
First thing we want to do is we want to add a mesh to our pickup.

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.700
So I'm going to hit control and space bar to open my quick draw.

5
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.180
I added starter content so we can go to starter content props.

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.260
If you don't have starter content installed you could do one of two things.

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.460
You could just go to the all content, you could select your filter from here and you

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.260
could click static mesh and that will filter all the static meshes in your project so you

9
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.940
can select whichever static mesh you would like.

10
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.180
I'm just going to clear that static mesh filter out because it's always good to remember

11
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.740
to do that just in case you can't find the information you want.

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.140
I'm going to go back to the props section and I'm going to say add this statue here

13
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
sm underscore statue for my prop.

14
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.740
Again you can add any mesh you would like.

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm going to go to add the green plus button here and you'll see static mesh and it says

16
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.100
sm statue because I've got the statue selected.

17
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.780
Now if you don't have anything that you can see the file name for there make sure you

18
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.380
select it through that quick draw by pressing control and space bar and selecting it.

19
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.460
So I've got the statue and I'll navigate around there.

20
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.400
Again same navigation tools as you're using with inside of Unreal viewport so right mouse

21
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.400
button to look around, left to go back and forth, both mouse buttons to go up and down.

22
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.720
So we'll add another component this time we'll type box into the search list and I

23
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.640
want to create a box collision.

24
00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.240
I'm going to drag this box collision up and on the details panel you'll see box extent

25
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.320
here.

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.800
So the box extent I'm just going to make a little bit bigger in Z and I'm going to make

27
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.320
a little bit thicker in Y and a little bit thicker in Z just so it houses the pickup

28
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.760
nicely.

29
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.160
So I'm going to compile, I'm going to save and I'm just going to put this pickup into

30
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.600
my map so I know where it is.

31
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.360
So I'm going to get the pickup window, I'm going to pin it up there for my blueprint,

32
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.440
I'm going to go back into the third person map, I want to select my pickup from the content

33
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.000
browser and just drag it into the scene.

34
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.960
If I look at it there, looks pretty good, the size is okay, that works for me.

35
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.480
So if the size of the asset that you picked isn't correct you can just scale that up by

36
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.260
going back into your blueprint window, selecting that and then selecting the scale of whatever

37
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.760
scale you want that to be, you can change those numbers.

38
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.700
So let's create a basic blueprint script just to pick up this pickup.

39
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.740
So we're going to select the event graph up here, I'm going to navigate to some free

40
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.060
space by right mouse dragging, I'm moving downwards.

41
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.060
I'm going to select our box from the box collision that we added before, I'm going to go back

42
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.420
over to the right hand side of the screen, I'm going to scroll down to the bottom and

43
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.020
you'll see on component begin overlap.

44
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.220
So I'm going to click begin overlap.

45
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.340
So you'll see on component begin overlap and in brackets you'll see box and that is the

46
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.660
box up there.

47
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.320
So I know that that box is talking to this event.

48
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.380
So when I overlap the box, I want something to happen.

49
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.960
So I'm going to drag out, I'm going to type destroy and select destroy actor.

50
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.720
So I just left mouse dragged out, a new menu popped up, I type destroy and you just select

51
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.300
destroy actor.

52
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.760
Now what this is essentially doing is saying I have overlapped this box, now destroy this

53
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.380
entire blueprint.

54
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.620
So I'm going to go to compile at the top left here, I'm going to save, I'm going to go back

55
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.840
into my third person map, I'm going to press the play button, I can see my pickup over

56
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.280
here and it just destroyed as I ran over to it.

57
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.520
So I'll hit escape and press play again, looking at the pickup, I run over to it and as soon

58
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.380
as I hit the box which is surrounding the pickup, it destroys.

59
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.880
And that in essence is the start of your blueprint journey where we can add much more functionality

60
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.860
into a pickup, you could spawn a particle that shows that you picked it up, you could

61
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.860
add a score to the pickup so that the player can start adding score.

62
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.860
From there you can start building these interactive experiences depending on what you want.

63
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.380
Hopefully that was just a useful quick example of what a blueprint can do and the power of them.

64
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.380
Thanks for watching!
