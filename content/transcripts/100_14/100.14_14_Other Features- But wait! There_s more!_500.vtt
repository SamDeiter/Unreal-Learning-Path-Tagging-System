00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160
Before we wrap up this course, I thought it might be useful to just go over a few other

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.280
features that you can maybe dig into and research through the documentation or directly through

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.800
the engine, just playing around and digging into the different tools.

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.960
So we can do landscape.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.880
We have a landscape tool.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.240
So if I just jump over to the engine from the select modes, you can select landscape

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600
and edit vast landscapes.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.000
And there's many powerful tools there to dig into.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.200
There is paper 2D, which is a 2D engine of Unreal Engine, where you can create your own

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.000
2D games.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
There are virtual production tools, which we briefly touched upon before, but there's a

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.360
lot going on in the virtual production space that are definitely worth digging into.

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.200
We've got end display.

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.200
We've got geometry editors, accessibility tools, take recorders, which are

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.480
take recorder is it can record a performance inside of Unreal Engine and create its own asset

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.840
type from that recorded performance for use for however you want to use those tools.

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.320
We've got automation tools and many, many more.

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.360
So it was a very kind of quick overview of everything Unreal Engine 5 has to offer.

19
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.040
There are plenty of avenues to go down, plenty of powerful tools for you to pick for your

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640
project, depending on its needs and capabilities.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.000
And hopefully from demonstrating here today, even though it can feel sometimes overwhelming

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.920
loading a new piece of software and there's so many buttons to click, you generally find

23
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.960
yourself getting into your own workflow, the things that you want to create, and it becomes

24
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.760
second nature.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.480
So definitely worth just getting stuck in from the different touch points today.

26
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.200
Maybe there are a few different tools that really look interesting to you that you want

27
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.080
to explore further through the different courses that we have to offer or through the

28
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.880
documentation.

29
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.000
But I hope this was a useful overview of what Unreal Engine 5 has to offer.
