00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.940
So it's probably useful to give you a bit of an idea about what assets and sub editors

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.420
are available and how you can create and change objects inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.200
So the subsystems that we're talking about in Unreal Engine today, we're talking about

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.840
rendering, lighting and materials.

5
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.120
We're talking about particles that you can create inside of Unreal Engine through the

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.360
use of Niagara.

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.800
We're talking about Unreal Engine's new audio system for Unreal Engine 5, physics and destruction,

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.400
animation, control rig and sequencer.

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.000
And again, sequencer being the cinematic tool that Unreal Engine has built in and the control

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.400
rig being the animation tool that allows you to create animations directly inside of Unreal.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.440
We're talking about blueprints, which are the visual scripting software built into Unreal

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
Engine.

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.160
And we're talking about UMG, which stands for Unreal Motion Graphics, which you can

14
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.960
create all your UI and interactive content from.

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.440
And we'll also be touching upon AI and lots more.
