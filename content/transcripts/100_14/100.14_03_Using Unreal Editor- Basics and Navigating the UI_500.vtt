00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400
So now that we have a good understanding and overview of what Unreal Engine is and how

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.520
the engine affects the editor, we're going to go over the basics and navigate in the

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.520
UI.

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.800
So you can think about the flow of the use of Unreal Engine starting from the left-hand

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.180
side here.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.700
We import all the files.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.280
They turn into this big project, which is housed of a series of UAssets.

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.980
And then the editor, the interface that you'll be using, plugs into that project.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.020
So you can interface with all the files.

10
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.420
You can have some tools plugins, as we referred to before, that can supplement the engine's

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.420
use.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
It may give you some more custom functionality over certain properties and features that

13
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.060
you need for your project.

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.920
And then the engine compiles everything.

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.660
It cooks to what we refer to as cooking the files and creating an application from all

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.240
of these files.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.800
So if we look at the engine versus editor again, the engine accessed via the editor

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.060
of Visual Studio.

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.680
It contains core tools and systems.

20
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.920
The engine manages all the moving parts, all the under the hood stuff that we referred

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920
to before.

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680
And it also packages the project.

23
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.600
Whereas the editor, it is your interface for adding, editing any of the content that is

24
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
there.

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.360
There is also sub editor interaction through different windows and browsers.

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.660
And it also visualizes all the project's content.

27
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.160
So if you've employed the 3D assets or the particle systems or anything that we were

28
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
referring to before, you can visualize all of these with inside the editor as well.

29
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.960
To access the editor, we want to download and launch a project file.

30
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.520
So we want to select the engine version.

31
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160
You can select the project.

32
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.000
And also there is a vault section along the bottom which will house any kind of free content

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.440
that you may have downloaded.

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.160
And there is more documentation for reference, but it's sometimes useful to just get a practical

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160
example.

36
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.080
So let's load the launcher ourselves and let's get stuck into a third person template

37
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.840
and show you exactly what we referring to here.
