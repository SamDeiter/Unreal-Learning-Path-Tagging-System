00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
So the audio system in Unreal Engine 5 is something that the team has been working on

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
for a very long time.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.300
It's a very powerful tool.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.200
Synthesize power is how we're referring to it.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.820
The audio engine inside of Unreal has had a big overhaul since the previous versions

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.360
of Unreal.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.820
And we can, on the base level of Unreal Engine 5, you can support sound waves.

8
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.900
And that sound wave is essentially the default data imported, maybe imported, maybe created

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.420
directly inside the engine.

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.140
But we've got the wave data and the sound cues will hold these waves and you can edit

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.480
the waves through controls.

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.100
So in the previous workshop, we created a quick material with a metal and roughness.

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.620
And we created a base material and created a material instance from that material.

14
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.860
I like to think of sound cues as that base material and the waves are the kind of child

15
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
to that.

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.540
So in the sound cues, you will add waves.

17
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.140
So it's that kind of relationship.

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.540
All waves can be found in sound cues, but not all waves need sound cues.

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.720
I hope that's a useful way to describe it.

20
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.760
We have Quartz inside of Unreal Engine, which is sample accurate to all the timings that

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.840
are happening inside of your interactive experiences.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.320
We can create music systems through clocks and metronomes.

23
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.680
And it also has full blueprint integration.

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.880
So you can, if you're doing any kind of real time interactions and you want certain inputs

25
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.560
to be registered to create SFX or music from, you can do that through the visual scripting

26
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.400
tool, which is a really powerful feature.

27
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.880
When we're thinking about meta sounds, we're thinking about replacing the sound cues and

28
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.000
having these larger meta sounds, which can have as simple or as complex scripting as

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you need.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.840
But essentially meta sounds are digital signal processing, a DSP, rendering graph, which

31
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200
has a complete synth creation.

32
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.240
There's many demos out about meta sounds.

33
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.880
It's a really powerful tool for users of Unreal Engine to be digging into.

34
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
And it's something very exciting to look forward to developing more in the future.
