00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
So when we're talking about Blueprints, UMG and AI, we're combining logic and components

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.260
to create some kind of outcome.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.720
So the Blueprints is Unreal Engine's visual scripting language.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.000
UMG is Unreal Motion Graphics, which you'll be creating a lot of UI from.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.920
And the AI systems we'll discuss inside of Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.600
So Blueprint, Blueprints and Blueprinting.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.720
Easy for me to say.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720
Class.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.800
A Blueprint class basically is a C++ class.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.640
So the visual scripting is just housing all of this C++ under the hood.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.240
So it's a core concept of an object inside of Unreal and primarily used to combine scripts

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.460
and other components.

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.960
So a class is what you will be building a lot of your functionality out of.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.640
An instance is a spawned object of a class that exists within the level.

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.800
So you may have created a class and added an instance of that class to the level.

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.180
These can be changed without changing their instances or the core class.

17
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.280
So you can edit on a per instance basis.

18
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.620
In the previous workshop example, when we created a material instance of the other material,

19
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.700
we could edit that color without changing the parent property there.

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
And that's what we talk about when we're referring to instance.

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.060
When you select a Blueprint in the Viewport, its data appears in the details menu.

22
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.580
So you can edit all of this functionality with inside the editor as well.

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.860
And it's a visual scripting tool.

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.740
So Blueprinting is the act of writing logic via Blueprint script.

25
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.500
It's visualized C++.

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.180
So again, when we're talking about C++ being under the hood, it's all C++.

27
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.940
It's just a nice visual representation of it.

28
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.140
And Blueprint can be baked during the packaging process to optimize it.

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.340
So some people prefer to do a lot of their projects inside of Blueprinting.

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.340
C++ is a faster language, just direct inside of Unreal.

31
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.860
But through using Blueprints, we can actually bake those Blueprints to get more efficiency

32
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.580
through the packaging process there.

33
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.580
A difference between the Blueprint class and the C++ class is C++ is faster.

34
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.140
Exactly like we were referring to before.

35
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.140
This can be up to 10 to 13 times faster.

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.220
So it's better to do functions in C++, a better online replication controls and processing

37
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.500
math loops.

38
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.380
It's the low level language of the engine.

39
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.260
So if you can put stuff into C++, definitely do that.

40
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.940
But Blueprints have their benefit, especially when working in teams and collaborating.

41
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940
We can prototype very rapidly.

42
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.900
So even if you have programmers on the team, you may find that programmers are still using

43
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.940
Blueprints a lot of the time just for rapid prototyping.

44
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.340
It's a very visual script that a lot of the team members can get behind and understand

45
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.940
how to debug their own information.

46
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.220
And there's better connections with the subsystems and tools.

47
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.180
So as we were talking about in MetaSounds, for example, which is the audio system or

48
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.060
the Niagara system, we can interface with other tools and subsystems via Blueprints.

49
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.660
And it's also a component answer window.

50
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300
So it's just very easy to edit.

51
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.900
But definitely worth diving into the documentation on Blueprints to learn more about Blueprints

52
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
and their pros and cons over using C++ classes.

53
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.820
When we talk about Unreal Motion Graphics, UMG, we're talking about HUDs, like any menus

54
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.340
that we want to display in the game, any user information that we want to present on the

55
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.340
screen.

56
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.260
UMG has a designer where you can drag and drop text boxes and images and you can animate

57
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.760
elements directly through UMG.

58
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.820
And it also has a graph, a Blueprint graph, which you can create Blueprint functionality

59
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.820
from to say, when I click this button on the menu, for example, create this kind of functionality.

60
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.140
So very powerful tool to kind of create a interface for your user or viewer.

61
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.220
And when we talk about AI, we have built-in tools for AIs to kind of query their environments

62
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.580
and understand how to navigate the space.

63
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.180
We have environmental queries, which is relatively powerful, not relatively powerful, it is a

64
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.660
powerful system for AI to understand their surroundings.

65
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.340
They understand when they're visible, when they're not visible, how far they are away

66
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.380
from the player, for example, if you're making a game.

67
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.180
We also have NavMesh, which you can see on the bottom image here, which will allow anywhere

68
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.940
in the green space for the AI to walk around and they'll just try and navigate around this

69
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.980
green space.

70
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.520
And also, as you can see, it becomes darker green the higher up you go, which creates

71
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.700
certain conditions for the AI to think, okay, I want to reach high ground, for example,

72
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.220
so they'll try and find the darker green areas.

73
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.660
We have behavior trees, which you can see in the top right here, and it is almost like

74
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.980
a state machine in the respect that you can create conditions for AI to walk around, but

75
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.940
it's not useful to think about it as a state machine.

76
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.500
Behavior trees are their own concept, which you can automatically create conditions from

77
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.740
in order for the AI to navigate the space in a way that you intend them to do.

78
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.220
In these behavior trees, you've got all the things you'd expect from a behavior tree,

79
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.420
such as blackboards and decorators and sequences and selectors, all these kind of tools built

80
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.660
directly inside of Unreal Engine.

81
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.140
We've got a perception system, so you can add a perception component to the AI, which

82
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.060
allows them to see and hear and create different perceivable events based on that component.

83
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.260
And we've also got mass AI, so if you're trying to create a lot of AI in a scene, there

84
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:08.660
are ways to do that in quite a straightforward way directly inside of Unreal Engine.

85
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.900
So it might be useful now to give you a better idea about Blueprint and how to create a basic

86
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.580
Blueprint so that we can understand the value and just how quickly you can get something

87
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.660
set up.

88
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.300
So in this instance, we're just going to create a basic Blueprint that we can place in the

89
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.540
level.

90
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.580
We're going to put a box around the Blueprint to say, when you overlap this box, just destroy

91
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.580
it.

92
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.500
And it's almost like creating a little pickup or something like this.

93
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.860
So let's jump into our editor.

94
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.740
We're going to find some empty space in the map, probably where the player starts running

95
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.700
from so we can be quite close by.

96
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.780
We're going to go to the content folder.

97
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.620
I'm going to right click and select New Folder.

98
00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.820
And I'm going to call this Blueprints.

99
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:09.460
And we'll right click in the empty space, Blueprint Class, which is the blue icon.

100
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.900
And we'll be given a series of options.

101
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.260
In other tutorial videos, we'll go through each one in other courses, sorry.

102
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.540
And we'll go through each one.

103
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.860
But for now, just select Actor.

104
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.660
And again, thinking about naming conventions, we'll go for BP, which is Blueprint underscore,

105
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.180
let's call this a pickup.

106
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.060
So BP underscore pickup.

107
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.100
So if you file, save all, and then we'll dig into the actual functionality into the next

108
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.460
video.
