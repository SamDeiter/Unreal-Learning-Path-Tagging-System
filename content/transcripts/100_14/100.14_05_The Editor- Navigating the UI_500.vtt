WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
As you're looking around the editor, we just want to highlight a few key areas that you

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.680
may want to look for when interfacing with the Unreal Editor.

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.300
So at the top, we've got the menu bar.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.960
You'll see that green play button there, which is what we use to jump into our experience.

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.120
And you can also select a few different modes.

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.440
You may be wanting to place content in your scene.

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.640
You may want to be adding foliage or landscape.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.920
That's where you'll select the different modes from.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.960
That will also be where we can compile our blueprints.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.200
We can create cinematics and we can also create an executable, depending on the platform that

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.440
we want to, whether we're packaging for a PC or a mobile or some other platform, which

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.780
is your intended output.

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.800
So the menu bar is at the top there.

14
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.560
The main viewport here is in number two, which we were navigating before.

15
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.840
I'll put some useful prompts on the screen in a second to help you navigate through the

16
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
editor.

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.320
The World Outliner is essentially a list of all the content that is within the scene.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.720
So you'll see everything selected there.

19
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.300
If I jump back over to my editor, you'll see in the World Outliner, you'll see everything

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.300
listed.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.680
And as I click the cube, it selects the cube inside the map.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.000
So it's just a big list of everything that's inside of the scene.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.960
If you double click anything, you'll go straight to it inside the editor.

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.720
So very powerful.

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400
It houses all the information that is part of your project to look through.

26
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.640
And it's just a very useful list to be able to navigate.

27
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.620
And then we've got the details panel, which will give you details of any specific actor.

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.080
If I hop on over to my editor again, you'll be able to see that we've got a whole bunch

29
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.540
of properties here based on the location, the rotation, what static mesh is being used,

30
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.180
the material, all these lists of properties that come as standard inside of Unreal Engine,

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.940
which will allow you to create the content in the desired effect that you want it to be.

32
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.640
When we're navigating the viewport, as we mentioned previously, you can use mouse navigation.

33
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.760
You can use it to look around.

34
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.360
You can also change the camera speed, which is useful if you're moving either too quickly

35
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.440
or too slowly.

36
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.120
And to do that in the editor, you can select the camera on the top right-hand side here

37
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.360
and set the camera speed to whatever you would like it to be, along with the camera scalar there.

38
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.160
We can also use the WSD keys to move around, which I was referring to before, and the Q

39
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.400
and E keys to go up and down.

40
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.940
If you didn't want to use your mouse to move up and down, you can use Q and E. And then

41
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.240
C and Z controls the field of view to get the desired effect that you may want.

42
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.120
We've got mayor style controls, so F is to fit to frame, Alt and Left mouse button to

43
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.380
tumble in orbit, and Alt and Right mouse button to dolly.

44
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.120
And again, some just useful viewport navigation hotkeys here in case you wanted to save their

45
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.000
and just remind yourself of navigating the interface.
