00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720
So when we're talking about rendering, we're talking about how do we see things inside

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.440
of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.760
We have multiple buffer views as a visualization inside of Unreal.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.880
So in the middle, you can see the main interface screen that you would generally see for most

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.120
of your projects.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.360
However, we can separate these buffers from base color to specular.

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.240
We can even check normals, world tangent, opacity.

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.840
There's many different views that we can see at real time inside of Unreal Engine, which

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.600
you can select from inside the editor.

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.040
When we talk about lighting, we can have different lighting shapes.

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.240
We can have point lights and spotlights and skylights.

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.920
There's a whole different range of lights that you can use to get your real time effects

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.840
looking exactly how you want them.

14
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:07.480
We can change the type of light from static to stationary to mobile or dynamic, which

15
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.900
means you either bake the lighting or maybe it's partly dynamic or maybe it's fully dynamic.

16
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.400
We have features inside the engine such as lumens, global illumination and reflections,

17
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.080
which is Unreal Engine 5's real time lighting.

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.840
We have ray tracing built in that you can use for your projects.

19
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.040
And also we can select between forward and deferred rendering methods depending on what

20
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600
you would like to use there.

21
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.400
So you can update the global illumination directly from the project to use the lumen

22
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.920
illumination.

23
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.440
And you can set a whole different bunch of properties here.

24
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.560
When you're digging into the projects and the content yourself, you can select between

25
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.800
the different rendering methods you would like to use there.

26
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.400
When we refer to textures, we're talking about images that hold visual data.

27
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.960
Textures inside of Unreal Engine have RGB and A channels, so the red, green, blue and

28
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.200
alpha channels.

29
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.680
And you can make tweaks to each of the textures on the right hand side details panel here.

30
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.920
You'll notice the details panel becoming a common theme throughout the use of Unreal

31
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.200
Engine's editing through the tools and the systems that we're using.

32
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.360
Details panel is always your go-to of where to edit this content.

33
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.920
So you do have adjustments that you can make with inside the textures of Unreal Engine.

34
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.780
When it comes to materials, we can create materials directly inside the editor.

35
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.980
We can create instructions for how you want that material to be rendered.

36
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.240
We can have material layers.

37
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.940
We can also create dynamic materials that can be affected at runtime, depending on your

38
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.400
desired outcome.

39
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.180
So we can change the shading models and the blend modes and different properties of materials

40
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.480
all directly inside of Unreal Engine and again through the details panel.

41
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.340
We also have meshes inside of Unreal Engine.

42
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.060
So NaNi is Unreal Engine 5's new virtualized geometry system.

43
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.580
So you can have millions of polygons being rendered on the screen at the same time to

44
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.720
a very high fidelity.

45
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.060
And we also have a static mesh editor built in, which you can use to edit the content

46
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.860
before it goes into your scenes.

47
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.020
To import meshes, you can go to the content browser and you can just go to add and import

48
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.180
or you can drag and drop the content in.

49
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.620
So if we just hop over to our editor again, you'll see there's content already here.

50
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.020
And because we clicked start a content and we'll go to the props folder.

51
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.180
So we've got some static meshes here.

52
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.940
So we have, imagine you had imported these static meshes.

53
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.940
This is where they would be.

54
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.620
So you can drag and drop your FBXs into the empty space here and that will import them.

55
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.220
You can click the import button and add files directly to your projects from there.

56
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.420
We also have a particle system called Niagara, which is Unreal Engine's new particle system.

57
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.220
You may see reference to Cascades sometimes and that's Unreal Engine's deprecated particle

58
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.940
system.

59
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.940
So you want to be using Niagara for all your particles moving forward.

60
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.700
And essentially this is an emitter's, a module's tool that you can use to create

61
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.060
the desired functionality.

62
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.700
You can animate the particles in there.

63
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.900
You can add scripts in.

64
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.100
Again, it's all very modular based to get the desired outcome that you would like there.

65
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.740
We can also support virtual productions.

66
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.300
So we have cinematic cameras built inside of Unreal Engine.

67
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.780
You can use composition to maybe have green screen performances composed in real time

68
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.900
inside of Unreal Engine.

69
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.420
So you can see everything updating based on the current frame inside of Unreal Engine

70
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.500
rather than waiting for it to render out.

71
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.940
We can do motion facial capture, sequence editing, and again, sequence being the cinematic

72
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.300
editing tool, and the in-camera VFX is also supported.

73
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.460
So more rendering features to maybe look into through the documentation.

74
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.580
The post-processing.

75
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.460
You can create film effects directly through the post-processing.

76
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.260
So whether that be lens flare or any other type of effects you'd like to add to your

77
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.060
scenes, you can do that through the post-process chain.

78
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.100
We have real time reflections supported, height and atmospheric fog, sky atmosphere.

79
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.620
So you can change the time of day, add clouds, the sun position, and this all gets added

80
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.620
under the hood inside the engine so that you can very quickly get different atmospherics

81
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.500
for your scene.

82
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.140
And then we have light mass tools which are the baking tools inside of Unreal Engine.
