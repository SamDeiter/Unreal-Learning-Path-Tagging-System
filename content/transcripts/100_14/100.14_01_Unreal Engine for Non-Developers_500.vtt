00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
Hello, and welcome to Unreal Engine's training for non-developers.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.120
Today we want to cover a few different areas to just give you a good overview of what Unreal

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.280
Engine is, what kind of terminology we refer to whenever you're working in the collaborative

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
teams.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.820
We're going to talk about using the Unreal Editor and where you can find certain features

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.820
and functionality.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.200
We'll also talk about how assets and sub-editors are handled, whether it be through the rendering

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.000
pipeline, animations and sequencer, which is Unreal's cinematic tool.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.480
I will be talking about other additional tools that are also in the engine.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.840
And then we'll be diving into Blueprints.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760
Blueprints is just a visual scripting language which uses code concepts from C++, but it's

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.040
just a more visual way of communicating the moment to moment interactions inside of Unreal

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.040
Engine.

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040
So let's get started.
