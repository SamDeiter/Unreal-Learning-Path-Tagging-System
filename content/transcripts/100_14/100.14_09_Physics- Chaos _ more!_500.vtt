Physics is another really powerful tool inside of Unreal Engine.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.500
So what are physics inside of Unreal Engine?

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.680
So we can create collisions and responses from a physics model.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.600
You'll see on the screen here you have some form of character mesh and you'll see there's

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.440
almost a pinkish-purpleish opaque material around the skeleton.

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.520
And that will show where the collisions and responses should be for this particular skeletal mesh.

7
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.240
All skeletal meshes can have these constraints and physics built into them.

8
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.920
So you have components which are constraints.

9
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.640
You can also have vehicles inside of Unreal Engine.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.720
So we can have accurate tire data and wheel blueprints.

11
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.400
You can get the car's feel and exactly how you'd like them to feel.

12
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:07.840
And also you have a skeletal PHAT, which is just the physics system for skeletal meshes.

13
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.680
Chaos is a big feature of Unreal Engine's physics tools.

14
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.080
And we can do geometry collections.

15
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.680
We can fracture meshes at real time.

16
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.480
You may have seen some demos of real time buildings crumbling from the different demos,

17
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.800
the various demos we've released.

18
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.080
We can cluster objects.

19
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.000
We can connect certain fractures to others.

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.360
So there's connection graphs and we can show the knock-on effects of these fractures happening

21
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.500
in real time.

22
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.200
And also you can create fields from these chaos destruction fields.
