  "text": " Optimization view modes are a really powerful way to get a visualization of what your scene is doing at any given view type and really powerful to help support you in your quest for getting optimization. So you can find these different view modes from your viewport, you can change the drop down from the lit model and change the view mode. There's many many different types that you can pick which will cover a few of the more common ones here today but it's definitely worth playing around with all the different view modes. So again in your viewport where you might see lit or unlit the button there at the top of your meme viewport, you can go through the modes there. So light complexity is quite useful for knowing how much resource is being used by the light. This is especially going to be predominant if you've got a dynamically lit scene for example or you've got a lot of dynamic lighting in your scene when you want the majority of it to be just statically rendered. So an ideal light complexity is this black to dark blue. As soon as it starts getting to green and orangey red, we start getting a little bit more expensive as soon as your scene starts going purpley, pink, a lilac colour or white That means like why it gets, it's almost like white hot in terms of lighting complexity. You really want to try and avoid that. That can be caused when there's a lot of dynamic lights overlapping each other. So yeah, lighting will have a big impact especially if you're deciding on you know the use of real time global illumination with lumen or something or whether you want statically baked scene. Again it depends on the project, it depends on the desired platform, what can be supported but light complexity is a very useful thing to be able to view here. We can also view Nanite in the scene as well. So when we look at Nanite we can see the instances, we can see the different primitives that are used, we can see the different materials that are used, any overdraw that's going on. So when we're referring previously to the overdraw of meshes, what is Unreal taking a few different passes on rendering. So overdraw can be caused when it's trying to render something at a distance. So it like renders the scene once, it's like right I've not got everything, it renders it again, it renders it again and how many times it needs to render that frame can cause overdraw and then you've also got different masks and this is just a really useful pre-visualisation of your Nanite here. And then when we're talking about Nanite overdraw you want to see these kind of darker patches in the Nanite overdraw as soon as it starts getting more layered in its approach and starts turning a bit more orangey there, that's where it gets very expensive. So the expense starts when the colour starts creeping in with the orange, as soon as you start getting brighter oranges almost like getting shades of white in there, that's where it gets very expensive.",
