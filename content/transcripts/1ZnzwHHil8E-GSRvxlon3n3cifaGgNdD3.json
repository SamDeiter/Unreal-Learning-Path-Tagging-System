  "text": " Now that we know how to send a variable over the network, let's take a look at how we can send a function over the network. Much like with propagating variables, the reflection system does a lot of the heavy lifting here. A remote procedure call, or RPC, is a method of calling a function on one or more remote clients or the server. We can go from the client to the server, or from the server to a specific client, as long as we're calling the function from an object that's ultimately owned by the player controller. Each player controller represents the network's connection between the client and the controlling server. With no player controller, we're unable to pick out a particular client to send a message to. Multicasts, however, are sent from the server to every connected client and, as such, require no player controller to be involved. Defining a function to be called over the network is as easy as flagging a function with the U function markup and supplying the appropriate specifiers. In our case here, we've got a multicast function being sent out reliably and with some required validation when calling it. We'll cover the multicast in just a second, but a quick note on reliability and validation. If we call an RPC reliably, we flag into the engine that this function must go through to receiving clients. It doesn't matter if it's late, it just needs to reach them. As gameplay engineers, we can't just a gameplay critical function call, so flagging a function as reliable ensures that the function will be called regardless of lag. We can also flag something as unreliable, which essentially outlines functions that are cosmetic or non-gameplay critical. If we hit a patch of lag just after calling this function, we don't need to worry about it being received as much as we would with a reliable function. Validation allows us to assess whether or not a networked function is what we expect it to be. If we return false from the validate function, the requesting client will be booted from the server. So consider the following. The client presses reload, sending a reload call to the server. If the amount that they want to reload by in a single call is greater than say a single bullet, we can assume they found some kind of exploits or work around and boot them from the server before they have any meaningful impact. As for the actual function definition, we actually have three separate functions that we need to implement. Firstly, we've got our base u function written here as multicast do function. This is just a stub function. It doesn't require any implementation directly. Then we have an explicitly defined implementation function for the networking subsystem to call once it receives the call over the network. And this is the main function where we put our gameplay code. This is the body that contains our implementation. We then have a validate function that holds our RPC validation certification code as we mentioned above. If we omit the validation specifier, the compiler won't prompt us to add a validate function. RPCs come in three flavors. First, we've got server functions and this function when called on the client will execute the body on the server. This will only work if the object that we're calling the RPC from is owned by the local player controller. Next, we've got client. When called on the server, the body of this function will be executed client side. Much like a server call, a client call also needs to be called from an object owned by a player controller. This player controller dictates what client the body is actually executed on. Lastly, we've got multicast and this function is fired everywhere. That's locally on the server as well as on all relevant clients. If the client is out of relevancy, the RPC will still be sent but not received. So, that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it.
