  "text": " Hi, everyone. In this lesson, we're going to talk about the introduction to Lumen and how to work with the properties and settings and get the proper workflows in the right direction when using the tool. So let's get started. So first up, you're probably wondering, what is Lumen? Sean's talked about it a lot, and what does it exactly mean? Well, Lumen is Unreal 5's fully dynamic global illumination, like we mentioned before, reflection system that is designed for next generation consoles, default global illumination, and reflection system. So it's not dependent on having the latest machine, but higher settings using ray tracing support, which we'll talk about how to turn that on. Our GPU expensive, so a new machine in that case may be needed. So just keep that in mind. If you want the full capability of Lumen, you might want to make sure you have the latest hardware that's able to run things accordingly using ray tracing. So Lumen renders diffuse, it's reflection with infinite bounces, which we talked about, and indirect specular reflections in large detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. And again, we've mentioned this before. And where it really shines, it's able to create a, be able to handle a large scene using Nanite. And in times, you may want to even experiment with Megalights, but it's able to get the bounces that you need, the reflection, reflected surfaces that you need. Everything seems to come together really nicely and smoothly without a huge hit on your performance. Now, like anything, you can throw the kitchen sink at it and put a lot of stuff in your scene. And if they're not optimized properly, there can be some issues. But Unreal right now, as it stands, can handle a lot of geometry, a lot of lights, and a lot of reflective surfaces. So you just have to manage accordingly. And it's always a good reference to be able to prioritize what is the most important, what the player will see, and what the camera will see if you're working with linear content such as film. Those things will get the better amount of work and amount of love. So that's still a good, even though Unreal can do some great things, it's still a good practice. So Lumen GI, diffuse indirect lighting. So a light bounces and color bleeds. It handles both of those like a champ. It allows things to bounce off, and you'll see my little graphic here on the side. As the camera picks up, the light bouncing from surfaces and from lights and so forth, it actually does refraction really well and handles it really, really great, as well as glowing objects, which we'll talk about in just a bit. It provides infinite diffuse bounces. Unreal Engine 5's nanite visualized geometry allows geometry to be much more detailed. So not only do we have the pairing of Lumen, which is optimized to be able to handle a large scene, and with Megalights, a good amount of lights, you also can pair it up with nanite, and I recommend you do, because nanite, virtual shadowmaps, and Lumen are like the three musketeers. They work really well together. So Lumen achieves full resolution shading while computing indirect lighting cheaper than before. So it gets better and better with each itineration, and noise gets removed. There may be a tiny bit of noise, but you'll notice there's a dramatic amount less of noise in 5.5 versus some of the earlier 5.3 and 4 releases. We also have sky lighting is solved as part of Lumen's final gather process, and includes a sky shadowing, and that allows indoor spaces to be much darker than outdoor lighting, much more natural effect. So Lumen also provides lower quality global illumination for lit translucency and volumetric fog, so it handles it like a champ. So again, emissive, you've got to be careful with, so let's talk a little bit about that for a second, and we'll do a little bit of demo and see what it looks like in engine. So emissive materials propagate light through Lumen's final gather with no additional performance cost, and it does it quite well. And this will show up on your characters as well as your environment pieces. But however, there is a limit to how small and bright emissive areas can be, but before they can begin to cause noise, artifacts to appear. Now, keep in mind, when, this is improved though, but still, if you have a very small glowing object, you could get noise, because it's harder to solve them manually. It's harder to solve those small ones compared to like if you just put an actual light in the scene is really what I mean here. So you just got to keep these things in mind. You have to consider, you know, if you have a very small glowing object that needs to glow, you might want to do a combination where you have just a minimal glow going off that material, but then you're also putting in a physical light to make things a little bit more controllable. So it's kind of give or take. So just test it out, and you'll notice it has improved greatly from other versions, but it does a great job as it stands. So Lumen, what is it? Lumen solves indirect specular or reflections for full range of material roughness values. Diffuse GI and shadowed skylight can be seen in all reflections, and Lumen reflections also support clear coat materials. So you'll see that it actually works really well for such things as car materials. What it replaces. So what it replaces is skylight with AO or unshadowed objects. We have screen space GI. It also replaces ray tracing GI and third party GI solutions such as Nvidia's ray tracing XGI. So since 5.5 Lumen can now run at 60 hertz on platforms for which there is hardware support, thanks to many improvements to the system that the underpin hardware ray tracing, you'll see that there will acronym and you'll see this a couple of times. So hardware ray tracing. These improvements also impact the performance and capabilities of Path Tracer and light baking. So it's kind of a domino effect. We've improved it, but it also is made it so that it also improves Path Tracer, which is really fantastic. So how to set it up. In the next video, we're going to go into some detail on how to set up these in your system and things to look out for in caveats. And we're going to set it up in our scene. And I'll point out all the things you need to consider. Thanks again.",
