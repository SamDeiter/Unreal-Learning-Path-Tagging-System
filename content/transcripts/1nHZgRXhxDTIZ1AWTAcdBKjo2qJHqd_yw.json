  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video. In this, we will be going over exercise three, where we will be looking at using the stimuli sources. So we're back in the engine now, and I have just come over to the fourth slide, which is exercise three, stimulus sources using the teaching aid. You can see what we have here is a setup with another AR. And a number of these coin pickups. So if I was to simulate, you can see that the carajer wanders around, and can pick them up, but not necessarily on purpose. What we want to change here is we want to create it so that using the perception component when the AI sees a pickup, it will go to the nearest one and pick that up until they're all picked up. Okay, so let's have a look at our ST stimulus, state tree. Again, very simple. We have a wanderer about until we see a pickup. Now at that point, we move to the pickup. Move to. And you'll see in the left hand side here, we have the location to move to and go to pick up again. Again, we're using this evaluator set up to get the information from the AI. Now let's have a look at the AI. Okay, so. You can see is happening here. Again, we are using the on target perception updated. And we are doing our standard check to see which one's using. And in this case, we're using AI site. And we are looking at the scene item and we are checking to see if it is tagged with the tag pickup. If it is, then we are going to what we're going to be doing because there are multiple pickups. And we only really want to go to the one that's closest to us. We've written a piece of code here. But what this will ultimately do is add the scene item to the array actors to pick up. And what this is going to do is it's just going to check that it's either not already in the array, because if we see something multiple times, we might add it to array multiple times. And also that it's not set as our next picker. Then we are firing off an event update pickups. And if you look at update pickups, basically what it's doing is finding the closest pickup to the actor and setting that as the next picker. You'll also see we have an event that when it's picked up, it will clear the pickup. It will turn off and it will then update to see if we have another pickup in the cycle. So all the coding is already done. To get this to work, all we need to do is to jump in to our BP picker. And we already have the component overlap, which gets rid of it. It says it's been picked up. The only thing that we don't have is any way for this to be registered within the perception component. Because we are not a child of the pawn class, we are a child of the actor class, it will not automatically pick us up. So in order to do this, what I'm going to do is come up to the components, push add, and I am looking for the AI perception stimuli source. When we grab that, we do need to choose what source we are registering for. So in this case, I am going to register for site. And the other thing is we want to auto register as a source, have that set on. And this will mean that it should be able to pick us up as we go along. OK, so I now press Clile and Save. And if I jump in, they'll run it. Let's see, we got a very different behavior. Her action is just going to go through all the pickups until there is none left. So that brings us to the end of the stimuli source video. And this is just, we are going to be able to add in a component that will allow an actor that is not a child of the pawn class to register as a source. And there we used VoloSight. Thank you very much.",
