A blueprint class exists inside your content browser, and it's basically the core information of that blueprint. If we were to open it up, we'll see that that blueprint class contains all of the logic inside of its event graph. The construction script can keep preloaded data in here, and the viewport will show a combination of all of its components. Its components are mostly the physical aspects, such as the camera, or the mesh, or this capsule. And so, whenever we make an instance of this class by dragging it out, we get a kind of copy of it. These are your blueprint instances. A blueprint instance can have changes made to it that won't affect the core class. But any changes made to this core class will propagate down to any instances of it.",
