  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to look at editing levels, stage monitor, and level snapshot. So let's get started. Editing levels is a big part of Unreal, but then again, people can also choose world partition. We'll talk about that difference in just a second. Most times when levels are simple, they can be managed in one persistent level. But this is not always the case as more assets get pushed into a scene. You may want to actually parse those a bit so that you can keep things organized. The level system in Unreal allows many people to work on a project and edit different aspects such as lights, geo, and effects without interfering with other items. This system keeps things clean and easier to manage. As you can see up here to the right, you can also lock them down and make it so that only particular things can be edited. This is up to you and your team. I did mention in the beginning of this conversation that world partition could be an option. The problem with world partition though, is it sometimes has a bit of a problem when it comes to working with Perforce and being consistent with those changes. So keep those things in mind. In virtual production, a lot of times, you will not be using world partition. You will simply be setting up a scene and using levels to manage things. So two ways you can add to levels. You can select a geo or lights or etc that you wish to separate in a persistent level and go to levels, create new with selected actors. You'll see that right here off to the right. You can also load other outside levels to a persistent level and stream them via blueprints to call on when needed, or have them always loaded if you need it in the level right away while you work and be consistently there. You can lock them down, you can control visibility as you saw me point out, invert selection, select and deselect actors as well as many other things for management. This is really up to you how you manage it. Let's briefly look at it in Unreal, and I'll point a few of these things out. Before we move on to stage monitor. In Unreal here, you can see that I have a persistent level, and in here I have a geometry level, and I also have an NDC level. This NDC is used to send things to the wall. I'm going to turn that off, and that wall being an LED volume. You'll notice I have one piece of geo that does not seem to be in the geo level. If I wanted to, I could go in here and right-click that particular level I wanted to go to, and I can move selected actors to that level. I can also add at any time under level, I can add existing levels in here if I've already built them and say somebody is externally working with them such as building the lights, doing some blocking, or adding some geo to a particular area. I can merge those into this area if I need it. You can see merge too if you select them. In this particular interface, you can actually select several and merge them into one if you wish. Now, you'll see the streaming method. This is what I mentioned where if you want a blueprint or always loaded, that's really up to you. In this case, you can see that this geo is blueprint and everything is just fine. You can create a folder at any time if you need it, and then you can organize things accordingly. You'll see some settings here where you can display the paths and display actor count. Those are actually pretty handy. You can also summon level details. Now, I don't have anything selected, but if I did, this is what would come up and give me an idea of how things are set up. You can also color code them if you need to. Let's go ahead and take a look at stage monitor for a brief minute, and then we're going to move on to our using level snapshot. Stage monitor is a tool used to track loading progress and connections, giving a light view of performance with multiple machines communicating together. Events can appear to be out of order in stage monitor if they're not synchronized. So to effectively monitor Unreal Engine instances, enable timecode on all instances you want to monitor, and use the same timecode provider, C timecode and Genlock. I give you a link here so you can jump into that a little bit deeper. For more information on synchronizing timecode across machines, that's very important when using stage monitor, otherwise it's not going to quite work the way that you want. You'll see that you have to activate it via the plugins. In your plugins, just look up stage and you'll find stage monitor. Turn it on, reboot, and you'll now see you're able to get to it. And let me show you where that's located in Unreal. Now, with it active, you want to go under Windows and you'll see virtual production, and there you'll find stage monitor. We don't have anything set up in this particular case with timecode, and things synchronized, but that's pretty much where you would find it. Now, let's briefly take a look at Level Snapshot and its benefit. So Level Snapshots enables you to save a particular configuration of the actors in the world outliner of your level and instantly restore your scene to that state. It's really nice to be able to work with it in Lumen, and it works pretty fantastic. I'll show you a demonstration in just a bit. This can dramatically streamline complex setups, keeps things organized and avoids duplication. Level Snapshots are especially useful for virtual production as they enable users to reset virtual environments to their starting position between takes, as well as track per shot changes that may occur during a shoot, while preserving the base starting point of the level. So the benefit Level Snapshots contain a record of the actors in the world outliner basically takes a photograph, you can think of it that way, and places it in a Level Snapshot interface. Let me demonstrate. First in plugins, you want to make sure that they're active. So I'm going to go and type in Level, and then I'm going to type in Snapshot, and you'll see that Level Snapshot is enabled. You, of course, will require a restart afterwards. Once you have it set up, I'm going to go and click on it, and you'll find the icon up here. It shows a few small little pointy mountains and an arrow right above it. I'm going to go to the little hamburger icon here, and I'm going to go to Open Level Snapshot Editor. Now in the editor, I can go in here and create a brand new snapshot if I want to. So I like this lighting, so I'm going to zoom out just a little bit, get a better comparable, and I'm going to say take a snapshot. It's going to ask me for a description. This is really helpful, so I'm going to put it in here. Now again, this is covered deeper in other classes, but I'm giving you an overview of what you can do and the power of this. We'll call this Description, and we'll say Create Level Snapshot. Now, see, my director wants to change the lighting in this environment and says, well, I prefer it over here in more of a meeting or more of an evening setting. I don't know why I said meeting. There you go, and then we'll lower this just a bit, just a little bit more of a darker setting there, and I can take a level snapshot of that. We'll call this Eveningwear. Well, if you're an 80s kid, you'll get this, and we'll say Create Level Snapshot. So now I can flick between these, which is actually pretty cool. I can click on the first one, double-click, and then a little button will show up towards the bottom here says Restore Level Snapshot, Restore, and it brings me back to that original. And the director says, you know what? I prefer what we had before. Say, hey, no problem. I have it in the queue here. So I can double-click on the one we just made and say, again, Restore Level Snapshot. There you go. So you can use filters to be able to filter through things if you want to, that's a bit more advanced, and we don't really cover it in this class, but this gives you the idea and the power of working with Level Snapshot. So you can actually change your lighting on the fly, and this works best with Lumen. And you can use it with some baking aspects, particularly stationary, but just be careful with it because remember, when you change your lighting, it does require a re-bake. So if it works, it'll be great, but do not put in any static lighting because that doesn't quite work as well with when working with Level Snapshot. Working with Lumen is the prime area of where you want to work with it. Well, that's about it with this section of the lesson. Here's some links to give you some resources on some of the topics that we talked about. In the next section, we're going to look at a material overview.",
