  "text": " Continue working on your project. You can also load the map 05 Post Process to pick up where you left off. Let's revisit the post-processing volume for a moment, select it in the scene. The last time we played with it, we used it to adjust the exposure in our level, but one can do much more than that. You can add image effects such as vignetting, or grain. You can adjust lens flares and their intensities, which have actually already been toned down courtesy of the main map we started with. You can adjust lens flares and their intensities, which have actually already been toned down courtesy of the main map we started with. The same goes for bloom effects on bright areas. One additional effect you can opt for is to use Ambient Occlusion. It may help in some situations. If you want to check the effect of ambient occlusion in your scene, if any, you can switch from Lit mode to Buffer Visualization, Ambient Occlusion. You can see that the effect is currently minimal, not only on the buildings but also on the foliage. Locate the Ambient Occlusion section or search for it in the Details panel, and change the intensity from 0.3 to about 0.7. It appears stronger, but you also need to adjust the radius to control the spread. A value of 10cm is too minimal for an effect on a large-scale construction. Set it to about 30 or 35 and see the effect on the buildings, but also on the trees and bushes. Switch back to Lit mode and test the results. Next, let's see how we can improve the effect of sunlight. Select the Sun-Sky system and then select the Embedded Directional Light in the Details panel. Scroll down to the Light Shafts area and enable Light Shaft Occlusion. Scroll down to the Light Shafts area and enable Light Shaft Occlusion. Know what happens when a sun disc is occluded behind an object like a tree for example? It gives way to some very interesting rays of sunshine. You can also control the light shaft bloom and its scale if you so choose. Right below the Light Shafts section is another section about Cascading Shadows that controls how the sun shadows are being processed and viewed on-screen. The Dynamic Shadow Distance controls the visibility of shadows. For example, a value of 5,000 makes shadow disappear if the camera goes beyond 50 meters. However, shorter distances yield better shadows. Note the shadows of these tree leaves cast onto the buildings. They are much sharper when the diameter of the sun is smaller than the diameter of the sun. The difference between the two is that the sun leaves are much sharper when the diameter of the sun is smaller than the diameter of the sun. Note the shadows of these tree leaves cast onto the buildings. They are much sharper when the Dynamic Shadow Distance is set to 5,000 than when it's set to 20,000. Here set it to a mid-range of 12,000, but you can still make the shadows look better by setting the number of dynamic shadow cascades a little higher, such as 8. This can get expensive, so don't overdo it. The shadows will blur away as you zoom back but become more detailed as you get closer to them. Save your work. In the last step, you'll add a few characters to the scene to liven it up a little, and learn how to output still images of your project to disk.",
