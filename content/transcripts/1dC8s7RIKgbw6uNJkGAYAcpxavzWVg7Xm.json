  "text": " Now that we've created our first simple animation walk, we're gonna utilize the blend multi-node in order to create more animation. So we're gonna take our creep walk animation, blend it with some more existing animations to get the desired effect, and then we will utilize the alphas to blend at specific levels of what we want to take over more or less. So let's go ahead and open our project. And what the first thing we need to do is we need to search for that blend multi. So we can do blend multi, and there it is. There's our blend multi-node. Now you can delete the other ones if you wish, or you can keep them in depending on how you want to work with it. And we are going to go ahead and connect it to the result. And now we're gonna take our creep walk, and that's actually gonna be our first pose. Okay, now we do want to use the run forward and the follow. Let's go ahead and grab those, and I'll tell you why we're using those here in a second. So go ahead and grab the run forward. We'll make that Mr. Pose one, and be like, but John, how do we add the follow? So this is something nice about this node. This allows you to right click and add a pin. As you'll see as we work with other ones, they may even have a plus add, but in this case, you just right click and hit add. And you can do that for as many as you want, but I would highly advise to be careful with the number because then you start working with optimization issues. It'll start to lag really badly. So try to keep those two as a decent minimum. I wouldn't say depending on your computer, how many you want to use. But in this case, we're just gonna use these three. So again, you could right click and add as many as you want, we don't need to do that. Okay, so go ahead and connect this final follow up to here, and I will explain why we are doing this. So right now, as it's hooked up, there is zero, there's nothing blending out, we're basically getting nothing. So to start to see this in effect, let's start increasing these numbers. Do 0.1 here, hit compile and save, and we'll get the creep walk itself that we just created earlier, all right? Now we're gonna do the run forward to see how this works. Now we're gonna do the same, we're gonna do 0.1, so now it will be shared, between the two, now it kind of messes things up, he's leaning a little different, and so that's not exactly what we want. So now let's add the follow up. You recall from a follow up, his hands drop up when they're jumping, and when they fall, the hands go up and kind of do something weird as well as the legs. So we're gonna do a number, now this is arbitrary, you can do whatever you want, but let's do 0.2. Now the reason that means this is gonna get more of the percentage of the animation taking over. So as I hit compile, and save, we got this nice little animation of a sneak. So what we could do is we could save this as another, you could record this and do it as the sneak walk because there is no sneak walk that was installed with Unreal. So we could go ahead and record that, and you can do that if you wish. I'm gonna do that, put in my class animation, and I'm just gonna call it the sneak walk. Again, you do not have to do this. We probably won't use this particular animation later. We'll be using something slightly different. But again, go ahead and try and do a recording, and do it for maybe four seconds or so. You don't really need a lot. So I'll just hit okay. I'm gonna go to about four seconds and hit stop. And you can open it just to kind of see what you did. Looks like he's sneaking really well. And we get a little bit of a hiccup again. That can be fixed a little bit later, or you could adjust it yourself and just delete the previous. But for now, that works for me. So I'm just gonna go ahead, save. And there you go. Now that we've created the sneaking walk as well as our initial zombie walk, let's take a sidestep and take a look at some other blending nodes at our disposal. The blend poses by nodes.",
