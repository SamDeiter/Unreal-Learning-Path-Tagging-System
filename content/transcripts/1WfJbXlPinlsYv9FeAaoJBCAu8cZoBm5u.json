  "text": " In this part of our tutorial we're going to be taking a look at ways we can optimize our static and skeletal meshes so that they perform across multiple platforms in a way that is predictable and how we expect. The first thing that we're going to be talking about is system units. Now before you can start creating anything in your project it's really important to set your system units correctly. And this doesn't matter which digital content creation program you are using. In this demo we'll be using 3ds Max but the same principle applies to any digital content creation program or DCC. Unreal Engine 5 uses centimeters as its default unit of measurement so your DCC should match that to ensure everything imports the correct scale. Getting the scale right is critical for a good user experience. If your assets are too large or too small or inconsistent in size it can completely break the immersion which is especially important in things like VR experiences. Proper scale is also critical for Nanite fallback meshes which rely on accurate proportions for performance and visual fidelity. So again remember that Unreal 5 uses centimeters. One Unreal unit equals one centimeter. And the easiest way to make sure that you adhere to this is to set the system units of your digital content creation program to use centimeters. The next thing we're going to talk about in mesh optimizations is Nanite and when to use it. The short answer is use it anywhere and everywhere you can. There's a small fixed overhead for having Nanite enabled so in most cases it actually makes sense to take advantage of it rather than turn it off. Nanite typically uses less memory and fewer resources than traditional static meshes while maintaining the same visual qualities your high resolution source assets. And it also helps reduce draw calls meaning you can combine multiple materials on a single mesh without performance loss which simplifies your scene setup. The only reason to really not use Nanite is if your target platform doesn't support it. And right here we can see two similar static meshes. One with Nanite enabled and one with Nanite disabled. So we have our static mesh up here in our Nanite mesh and at first glance they look relatively the same. But if we look at them in a little more detail we're going to start to see some really significant differences. For example the area that we have highlighted here on the static mesh we can definitely see the polygonal lines like this is definitely a 3D mesh. But if we look at the Nanite mesh notice that this is no longer a polygonal line. In fact the line actually goes up and down it has highs and lows or much like we would expect if we were looking at the side of an object in the real world. So we can see just from this example the type of fidelity and resolution that we are getting with Nanite. Now one of the other things that we need to know about Nanite is how it generates a fallback mesh. So right here in this example we have this robot which we'll take a look at in the editor in a second. This is the Nanite mesh and this is the static mesh fallback. The fallback mesh is what gets used for things like ray tracing, collision, other non-Nanite systems and platforms that don't necessarily support Nanite. So inside the static mesh editor there are a few settings that you can use to adjust the geometry or reduce the geometry of both the Nanite mesh and the static mesh fallback. These settings are called keep triangle percentage. This lets you reduce the triangle count to optimize performance and then trim relative error. This increases how aggressively Nanite trims geometry which can significantly reduce disk space usage. Now you can quickly go between the Nanite mesh and the static mesh fallback in the static mesh editor by hitting control N and we will take a look at that right now. So inside of Unreal, I'm going to close this window real quick, we're going to hit control space. We're going to open up our SMBot. There we go. And we do have Nanite for this. So if I hit control N, you can see here as soon as I do that says showing fallback and then we see the values right here. And then if I want to do anything over here under the details panel in the Nanite settings, we have our keep triangle percentages. Put this down to 50 and hit apply. We're going to see what this is going to do is it's going to take our fallback triangles to write about half of the number that they were before. And I do believe that I need to do this to the percent triangles here. There we go. Wrong one. That was the keep. That's for disk size. I wanted the fallback size right there. So right there about 40 will hit apply changes and there we go. That's what we're looking for is the fallback triangles right there. So again, it hit about half that size. For platforms that don't support Nanite, there is the built in level of detail tool that can be found inside of the static mesh and the skeletal mesh editor. With this tool, you can have Unreal programmatically generate different versions of your static mesh that are reduced in triangle count. We can see an example of that here. This little cow taken from the starter content starts at 2500 triangles. And using the tool, we can actually reduce this down to 1200, 600 and 300 triangles respectively. Now, these numbers are not set in stone. It's a good to start reducing it around 75 percent for LOD1, 25 percent for LOD2 and then 12 percent for LOD3. But these are just suggestions. You should test and use numbers that work best for the project that you happen to be working on. Now, keep in mind that you can apply level of detail adjustments to both your static and your skeletal meshes. Static meshes have a slightly simpler interface. With static meshes, you have the ability to select their termination based off of the triangle count, the vertices count or a combination of both, making options very, very simple for static mesh LOD creation. Skeletal meshes, on the other hand, have a slightly more robust reduction tool. And that's because skeletal meshes have to be reduced, but also have that reduction work with things like morph targets and animations. Let's just take a quick look at the editor really quick. And inside of our SMBOT here, or inside of a static mesh, we're going to look at setting this up to have some level of detail. So first, we come down to our LOD settings, number of LODs. We're going to set this to three and hit apply changes. And this is actually how simple it is to do this. Now that it has finished processing, if we come over here to our LODs, we can go LOD zero, LOD one and LOD two. If we click on LOD auto, the LODs will automatically change as I move further and closer away to this object. We can then come here. I'm going to go to LOD zero. We can come down to the LOD zero settings under its reduction. And we can see here the percent of triangles to keep. If we come here to LOD one, you can see here if we come down to our reduction settings, we're at 50 percent. And then we go to LOD two. And again, we come down, not our sections, sorry, our reduction. And we're at 25. So we can simply just do something like this and hit apply changes. The other great thing about this tool is that it's non-destructive. If we need to increase or further decrease any of the settings in the generated level of details, we simply come into the tool, make the reductions, press the build button. And that is all that we have to do. Now, as I mentioned before, the SkeletalMesh tool has a slightly few more options. And one of those options that I want to talk about is the bone priority reduction. Now, what this does is this will weight any geometry that are skinned to any bones very high so that when the reduction logarithm is applied to them, that geometry will be the last thing to be reduced. And we can actually see a really great example here. On the left, we have the default reduction. And while this does look like a hand, it's actually missing a lot of geometry or it has a lot of geometry that's been collapsed down to either a single triangle resulting in just something again that looks kind of like a hand at first glance. But it's actually got a lot of issues by taking all of the bones that are inside of the hand and making sure that their bone priority reduction was set to a very, very high value. We can still use that great reduction tool, but now the hand itself still looks like a hand. The fingers still look like fingers. We don't have any weird looking geometry or anything like that. The next thing I'd like to call out is the lock open edges. This ensures that important vertices are not removed during the reduction process. This feature is especially useful when working with separate body parts. In fact, we use this inside of Fortnite. This is a head. You might see this head inside of Fortnite. And what I want to call out here is that there is this little triangle right here that's got a vertices right there that sticks out that needs to be there in order for the head and the neck to properly align. Now, if we run the skeletal mesh reduction tools by default, that little bit of geometry will actually get removed. And that's going to result in a gap. So the lock open edges again allows us to have that correct reduction without removing areas that actually need to be there so that we don't have any gaps inside of our geometry.",
