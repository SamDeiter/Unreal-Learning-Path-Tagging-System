  "text": " Oh, hi, and welcome back. In this class, we'll get an overview of our agenda for the upcoming lessons, as well as uncovering core concepts of physically-based materials in the Unreal Engine world. Alright, let's go. So as I just anticipated, in this class, we'll explore real-time physically-based rendering or PBR, understanding what it is and some overall guidelines that could help you use them more efficiently. Next, we'll look at the differences between parent materials and instance materials and expand their features. This means we'll be reviewing parent materials and instance materials and introducing the concept of the switch parameter for instancing purposes. We'll then be dialing it up with the development of mass materials, reviewing how they're created. And in this process, we'll be using minus nodes, clamps, and linear interpolation or LERP nodes, which I don't think we've actually explored yet. And this magic LERP node will help us with the creation of a mass material using one texture and its RGB channels, which is going to be quite cool. We'll conclude this course with material functions, understanding what they are and how to use function inputs to build an animated material function. Then we'll check out how to use material functions in parent materials. I think we're ready to get started with some PBR theory. So what is this real-time physically based rendering we've been mentioning since the beginning of class? Physically based rendering relies on a unified light and shading system. Alright, but what does this mean? It means that surfaces in real-time PBR approximate how light behaves in the real world. Physically based materials tend to be more accurate because they can be measured in lumens, lux inverse square law, energy conservation, etc. etc. And this approach tends to be more natural looking and is actually more intuitive and consistent. So putting it down visually, the approximation and unification of light and shade of PBRs can be categorized into non-metallic and metallic materials, as we can see in this slide. Metallic surfaces are characterized by their matte colors and absence of light reflectivity, whereas metallic surfaces are highly reflective, as we know. In these two charts on the left and right side of the slide, you can see the RGB values of real-life materials. But take into consideration that the RGB is actually a digital representation of color using a finite set of numbers, right? RGB is an additive color model, which means we start with black, the absence of light, and then add different amounts of red, green, and blue to create a full spectrum of colors. And here on the left, you can actually see how different real-life materials like charcoal, dry, dark earth, or asphalt are translated to the digital world using this RGB system. Keep in mind that in real life, there are no full blacks nor whites, and the color information of a surface always has a range. And roughness is a fundamental factor in the distinction between different materials. It's going to define whether a surface is, for example, made of metal, leather, or cloth. And speaking about roughness, remember that the specular input in a material will define also its reflectivity. It's important to find the right balance between the two, between roughness and specular, even though for most non-metallic materials, the default value of 0.5 specular is usually physically correct. OK, so here you can find an overview of the metallic range from 0 to 1. And here you can see a chart expanding upon the 0 to 1 roughness range of a material, defining how the light gets reflected on its surface. And it can be a bit confusing because it looks like the opposite of the metallic range, because a metallic value of 0 means that a material is not metallic at all, while a metallic value of 1, as on the right side of this chart, means that a material is fully metallic. While the roughness part is opposite, because a material with a roughness value of 1 has the light scattered in multiple directions, making the material matte, while smooth materials with a roughness value of 0 have the light bounced off at the same angle in a single direction towards us, creating a mirror-like surface. Alright, that was it for the theory of this class. I hope you enjoyed it, but you can find some additional documentation at this link if you're interested in further expanding your knowledge in physically-based rendering and materials. Thanks for sticking around, and in the upcoming lesson, we're looking to print and instance materials as well as to switch from our feature to expand on those two. Alright, bye!",
