  "text": " So with our editor open, we'll just go to file a new level, we'll get rid of the template and I'll just create a basic level just because it gives us some lighting information but then it's also not really got too many meshes in that we need to go ahead and delete. So I'm just going to, I'll probably keep the floor here for now just to make sure we have some kind of collision base and then we want to go into our mode selection up at the top left hand side here and we'll go to create a landscape. Now as we mentioned before, we'll make sure the location is 0, 0. It's fine for now that it's in 100, it just gives us a bit of rays from the ground here so 100 is just the vertical units in Unreal so I'm okay with 100 and then selection size, I'll just go for 15 by 15 here. Completely up to you how you go about doing that. Pick whichever size you prefer for your landscape but I think 15 by 15 is a good starting point and if you want to edit anything as well, feel free to do so but I'll just go ahead and create this and we'll get to actually sculpting the landscape. So with this selected, we've now created our new landscape and it automatically brings up this sculpting tool and many, many different properties that you can use to just play around and paint into the landscape. This is a really intuitive tool and so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to scale my brush. So I'm going to use this using the brackets keys. So the brackets keys next to the enter button on my keyboard, the open bracket will make it go smaller and the closed bracket will make it go bigger. If you can see on the left hand side of my screen here, the brush size is actually being affected so I'm using the brackets, the brush size is getting bigger and I'm using the left hand bracket to go smaller. I can of course scale this with my mouse here if I like but when you're in landscape editing mode and you're getting an idea of the flow and just trying to paint, it's cumbersome to keep going back to the left hand side to change the scale of the brush. So my main tools for when I'm sculpting, I'm holding down the right mouse button to pan around, I'm holding down left mouse button to paint and then I'm using both mouse buttons to move up and down and then I can hold down left mouse button to move backwards and forwards after that as well. So it's quite an intuitive process and so you can see here the first thing I did was when I left clicked it painted some height into the landscape. So I'm just going to use my brackets keys and just keep painting out here and we can see that I'm kind of creating some terrain and I mean just to get going on landscape that's a pretty quick solution for just creating some basic landscape and you can just play around with this. If you just keep clicking around it'll give you some softer results whereas if you click and drag it will give you some harsher results and so you can just play around with sculpting the landscape how you want it to be and then also it's worth looking into the brush falloff here because if you change the falloff it'll just give you a harsher falloff or a shallower And so playing with these two values the brush size and the brush falloff will give you a lot of results immediately straight out of the game which is really really nice and intuitive and so just spend a few minutes playing around with your landscape, editing it into some form of shape that you'd like and then we'll jump into some further options of the landscape.",
