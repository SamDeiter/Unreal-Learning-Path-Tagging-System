00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this final section of our course, we will go over the workflow for importing and setting up body correctives that have been created using the PoseDriverConnect toolset.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We will first go over the plugin that is needed to bring the RBF solvers into Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then we will jump back into Unreal Engine one last time to go over the steps for importing and assigning them to the metahuman body.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So let's begin by going over the required plugin.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The PoseDriverConnect toolset allows users to author their own corrective poses.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And the PoseDriverConnect plugin allows users to import the poses into Unreal Engine.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
From there, they can be applied using an animation blueprint.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The plugin is located in the FAP marketplace.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Begin by installing it to the appropriate engine version.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then inside of Unreal Engine, open up the plugins menu and enable the PoseDriverConnect plugin and restart the engine.

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now let's jump back into Unreal Engine one last time to go over the steps for importing and assigning the body correctives.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Inside of Unreal Engine, to import and assign the body correctives, let's first navigate to the Atomic Savage example body folder.

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I will open up the metahuman folder.

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Then go to the Atomic Savage example folder and then to the body folder.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The first step is to create a folder for the corrective poses.

16
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I have already created a folder named RBF Solvers EX for example.

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I will open this.

18
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now the next step is to create an animation blueprint.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I have already created one and named it RBF Correctives EX for example.

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But to walk you through the steps, right click in an empty space.

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Then select Animation and then select Animation Blueprint.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In this pop-up window, assign the metahuman base skeleton and then select Create.

23
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I am going to cancel this since I have already gone through these steps.

24
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now let's double click on this to open it.

25
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I will dock this up here.

26
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Inside of here, I am going to navigate to the Preview tab up here on the right.

27
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
For the mesh, I am going to search for the Atomic S body skin weights skeletal mesh and select it.

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then I will click on Apply to Asset over here.

29
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:49.000
In the Anom Graph, I am going to right click and search for Input Pose and select it.

30
00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I am going to connect it to the Output Pose and then I will zoom out and drag the Input Pose all the way over here.

31
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I will now compile and save this.

32
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Next, I will go back to the main viewport.

33
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I will go up here to Tools and go down here and select Pose Driver Connect.

34
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In the Pose Driver Connect panel, for the Retarget Source Asset, I am going to use the drop-down arrow

35
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and then locate the Atomic S body skin weights skeletal mesh.

36
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It is right here, so I will select it.

37
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
For the Animation Blueprint, I am going to assign the Animation Blueprint I have over here named RBF Solvers Example.

38
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Next, we need to assign the RBF JSON file.

39
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I will go here and in File Explorer, up here I will paste the location of the source files folder of our course.

40
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:07.000
In the Pose Driver Connect folder, inside of the folder named RBF Solvers, I am going to select the JSON file named Solver Data and then select Open.

41
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000
For the FBX Source Directory, I am going to paste the location of the source files folder up here again and then open the Pose Driver Connect folder.

42
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I will then select the RBF Solvers folder and then select Open.

43
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:40.000
For the FBX Import Directory, I will go to the MetaHumans folder, then to the Atomic Savage Example folder, then select the RBF Solvers Example folder.

44
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now I can select Import All RBF Solvers. This will take a moment.

45
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now that everything has been imported, I am going to save everything.

46
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:08.000
If we go to the Animation Blueprint now, inside of the Anim Graph, we will see that the body correctives have been added in here and are all connected.

47
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
All we need to do now is compile and save.

48
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I will return back to the main viewport and if we want to view a body corrective, I will double click on this one to open it.

49
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:36.000
In the Preview Scene panel, for the Preview Mesh, I will use the drop-down arrow to search for the Atomic-S Skeletal Mesh and I will select it.

50
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And then I will select Apply to Asset.

51
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Now if I scrub through this animation, we can't really tell if the corrective is applied, so we will want to make sure that the Animation Blueprint is assigned to this Skeletal Mesh.

52
00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I will go back to the main viewport, then in the Content Browser down here, I will go all the way down past all of these correctives and select the Animation Blueprint.

53
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
With this selected, I will go back to the Animation Sequence window and in the Preview Mesh section, I will use the folder icon to browse to the Skeletal Mesh.

54
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I will open this up and over here in the Asset Details panel, I would assign the Animation Blueprint here in the Post Process Animation Blueprint slot.

55
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Now before I do this, in the Skeleton Tree, I'm going to select the left upper arm and then rotate it.

56
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Now when I assign the Animation Blueprint over here, we can see what the upper arm area looks like when a corrective pose is applied.

57
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And this is how you import and assign body corrective poses to a custom metahuman body.

58
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Now let's do a quick review of these steps and wrap up our course.

59
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000
With the PostDriverConnect plugin enabled in the Unreal Engine project, create a folder for the RBF solvers to be added to when they are imported.

60
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Next, create an Animation Blueprint and assign the metahuman-based Skeleton to it.

61
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Inside of the Animation Blueprint, in the Preview Scene, assign the Custom Body Skeletal Mesh and then select Apply to Asset.

62
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
In the AnomGraph, add an InputPose node and connect it to the OutputPose.

63
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Then drag the InputPose node away from the OutputPose to make room for the pose drivers.

64
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The next step is to import the pose drivers.

65
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
To import the body correctives, in the MainView port go to Tools and select PoseDriverConnect.

66
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
In the PoseDriverConnect panel, assign the Skeletal Mesh and Animation Blueprint.

67
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Then set the path directories for the RBF JSON file, the FBX Source directory, and the FBX Import directory where you want them to be added.

68
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Next, open up the Animation Blueprint, Compile and Save.

69
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
For the last step, assign the Animation Blueprint to the Skeletal Mesh.

70
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Inside of the Skeletal Mesh window, in the Asset Details panel, locate the Post Process Animation Blueprint slot and assign the Animation Blueprint.

71
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
From there, you can test and see if the solvers are working.

72
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You can also open up the Animation Sequence window and play each corrective solver from the Asset Browser.

73
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In the Preview Scene panel, assign the Skeletal Mesh and select Apply to Asset so that you can see the pose driver on the target Skeletal Mesh and update the thumbnail image.

74
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Now that we have gone through all of the steps for importing and assigning corrective poses for the body, let's wrap up this course with some resources that may be helpful.

75
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000
All of the online resources and links to some of the tools discussed today can be found by following the URLs on this slide.

76
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference.

77
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:23.000
In the Resources section, you will find links to the DNA Calibration Repository on GitHub and the 2023 DNA Calibration Deep Dive Demonstration.

78
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:35.000
There is also a link to the Pose Driver Connect plugin on FAB and a tutorial on how to use the Pose Driver Connect Tool Set from the Epic Games Developer Community.

79
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This brings us to the end of the MetaHuman DNA Calibration and Finalization course.

80
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
As mentioned at the beginning of the course, with newer engine versions, some of the MetaHuman customization workflows have changed,

81
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and we will explore the new workflows in a future update.

82
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I want to thank you for spending your time with me and I hope that these videos help you as you continue working with MetaHumans in Unreal Engine.
