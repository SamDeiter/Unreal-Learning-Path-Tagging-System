00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
Once the customizations have been applied to our metahuman character in Unreal Engine,

2
00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.259
the next step is to check that everything is working correctly.

3
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.960
In this section, we will test the face and body with animations to see if any additional

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.400
adjustments need to be made in order to finalize this character.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.600
So let's jump into Unreal Engine and apply animations to the Atomic Savage character.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.040
Inside of Unreal Engine, I'm going to navigate to our course topics folder.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.520
And then go to the folder named Atomic S, example, anim sequence.

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.400
Inside of here, you will find a level sequence with a face and body animation that has already

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.320
been assigned to Atomic Savage.

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.240
I will double click on this to open it.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.000
Now to view the entire face and body, we can go to perspective and select the camera named

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880
cam01body.

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.640
And then we can play the sequence.

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.399
I'm going to stop this for a moment.

15
00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.280
To check the face, I'm going to go here and disable the actor and sequencer.

16
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm also going to disable the body animation for now.

17
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.920
And I'm going to go back to perspective and view this from the front view camera so that

18
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.519
we can see the facial features up close.

19
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.599
I'm going to play the sequence now.

20
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:31.079
As mentioned in the previous course, this particular stylized character's facial features

21
00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.000
go beyond the golden triangle of the face.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.280
And we anticipate that even though we've used DNA calibration workflows, we may still

23
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.640
see some breaks in the range of motion.

24
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.719
For example, in the eyes.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.879
I will zoom in here and continue playing this.

26
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:58.120
We will notice some intersecting between the eyes and the eye shell shader when this character

27
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.680
looks left and right.

28
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.319
This may be due to the eyeball and eye shell geometry possibly intersecting, or the eye

29
00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.599
joints may need to be adjusted and moved a bit.

30
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.599
Either way, this area may require some additional work.

31
00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.719
Now let's test the body.

32
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:22.639
I'm going to go back to perspective and select the CAM01 body camera again.

33
00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.560
I will go back to the start of the sequence.

34
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.199
And I will set the body animation track back to active and also set the actor track back

35
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.840
to active.

36
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.879
And now I will play the sequence again.

37
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.520
When we get to the portion of the animation where the arms are raised, I will press pause

38
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.120
right here.

39
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.000
If we look at the shoulder and neck region, we can see that this does not look correct.

40
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.520
Corrective poses can be created and applied to fix these problematic areas of deformation.

41
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.360
To demonstrate what this will look like when corrective poses are applied, I will select

42
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.680
the metahuman in the viewport.

43
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.599
In the details panel, I will select the body component.

44
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.840
And I will open up the body skeletal mesh.

45
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.039
For the post-process animation blueprint slot, I will assign the RBF correctives animation

46
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.319
blueprint over here.

47
00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.800
I will save everything.

48
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.560
Now when we return back to the main viewport, we will see that with the corrective poses

49
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.039
applied, the shoulder and neck region look much better.

50
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.480
Another thing worth mentioning is that the body animation that has been applied to atomic

51
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:45.879
savage has been retargeted from the female medium normal body weight using IK Retargetor.

52
00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.719
And the bone retargeting options have also been changed.

53
00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.599
I will go to the skeletal mesh asset window again.

54
00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:01.079
And inside of here, I will go to the skeleton tree panel and use the cog wheel to select

55
00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.239
show retargeting options.

56
00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.919
I've changed the pelvis to animation scaled.

57
00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:13.519
And I've also changed the main joints from animation to skeleton while leaving the correctives

58
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.679
set to animation.

59
00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:21.319
Now adjusting the retargeting options is helpful when retargeting animations from skeletons

60
00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.839
that are different proportions.

61
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:28.759
Let's do a quick review of what we just covered before we move on.

62
00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.759
To finalize customizations to the metahuman face, it is important to test the face with

63
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.120
animations to ensure that everything is working correctly.

64
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.360
Another option is to use the face control rig with a forward solve by checking each control.

65
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.480
Testing the face with animations can help you decide if there are any problematic areas

66
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.319
that may still need further adjustments.

67
00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.360
It is worth mentioning that the customized metahuman face will continue to be compatible

68
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.879
with metahuman animation tool sets such as metahuman animator and live link face.

69
00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.439
When testing customizations to the metahuman body with animations or by using the control

70
00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.280
rig, keep in mind that if there are significant differences in the skeleton proportions from

71
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.240
a metahuman based skeleton, body animations may need to be retargeted.

72
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.800
The bone retargeting options may also need to be adjusted.

73
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.400
The images on the right demonstrate what the body looks like when all of the main joints

74
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.360
are set to animation and what it looks like when they are set to skeleton.

75
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.240
To adjust the bone retargeting options, go to the skeleton tree in the skeletal mesh

76
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.879
or animation sequence window and use the cogwheel to check on show retargeting options.

77
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.480
From there, change the pelvis to animation scaled and the main joints to skeleton.

78
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.160
Now let's move on to the last portion of our course where we will go over some final recommendations.
