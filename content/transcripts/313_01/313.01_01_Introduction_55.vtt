00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Hello and welcome to Metahuman DNA Calibration and Finalization.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.099
My name is Gabriela Cresenio-Tacas and I will be your host for this course.

3
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.879
This course is a continuation of the Metahuman Fitting and DNA Calibration course.

4
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:24.240
We will delve into more advanced use case scenarios for using the DNA Calibration library

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.879
to modify the Metahuman Neutral Pose and explore workflows for integrating it with

6
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.079
a custom Metahuman body.

7
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.640
We will also dive into best practices for finalizing Metahuman customizations in Unreal Engine.

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.479
It is worth mentioning that with newer engine versions some of these workflows have changed

9
00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.159
and we will explore the new workflows in a future update.

10
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.120
Now let's take a look at what we will be covering in this course.

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.239
We will get started by touching upon advanced use cases where DNA calibration has been

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.679
used to make changes to the Metahuman head and body.

13
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.120
One case is the 2023 Unreal Fest DNA Calibration deep dive and the other is how the stylized

14
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.359
character Atomic Savage was customized with multiple workflows using DNA calibration.

15
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.560
We will then look at all of the steps that were taken to customize Atomic Savage from

16
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.120
the initial concept to the finalized rig.

17
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.240
From there I will break down some of the workflows in greater detail and walk you through how

18
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.719
you might apply these workflows to your own characters.

19
00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.760
The first workflow we will delve into includes a modified version of the Unreal Fest Calibration

20
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.960
script.

21
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.560
We will go over how to edit the Metahuman Neutral Pose by transferring the details from the

22
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.159
fitted head geometry assets that we looked at in the previous course to a Metahuman

23
00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.119
identity and then save those changes to the Metahuman DNA file.

24
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.920
For the second workflow we will go over how we can merge the modified Metahuman Neutral

25
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.319
Pose with a custom Metahuman body for seamless integration.

26
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.439
From there we will go through all of the steps for bringing the customized assets back into

27
00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.859
Unreal Engine with a hands-on exercise.

28
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.100
We will go over how to re-import the head-LOD-FBX files, update the Metahuman DNA file and the

29
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.900
Metahuman Blueprint, and then we will look at how to import and assign a custom Metahuman

30
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.180
body skeletal mesh.

31
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.780
We will then wrap up this course with some final recommendations and I will share some

32
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.480
tips and resources for you to use as you continue your training with Metahumans.

33
00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:54.459
This course will be using the project MEH9130055 and the level map should load automatically.

34
00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:03.759
The map is located in the content browser under the courses folder labeled MEH31301.

35
00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:12.399
In the course maps folder and it is named MEH31301MAPEX for example.

36
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.520
This map contains the non-modified version of the atomic savage character and we will

37
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.400
be using this map to configure all of the customizations we will be bringing into the

38
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.759
engine for the hands-on portion of our course.

39
00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:30.580
If you want to inspect the fully assembled version of this character, that is located

40
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:42.120
under the course folder named MEH21302 in the course maps folder and it is named MEH21302MAPC

41
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.840
for customized.

42
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.439
Now all of the scripts and assets we will be using throughout this course are located

43
00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.400
in the source files folder of our course named 31301DNACalibAssets.

44
00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.680
Inside of that folder you will find two scripts and their associated assets and in the folder

45
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.319
named POSEDRIVERCONNECT you will find the RBF solvers that we will bring into the engine

46
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.879
later on.

47
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.560
If you need to reference the location of the course map that can be found at the beginning

48
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.000
of the slide deck after the training outline.

49
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.620
Now as we go through this course you will find that many slides in this presentation

50
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.000
contain a lot of information and I will summarize all of that for you but if at any point you

51
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.079
want to read what is on each of those slides feel free to pause and dive right in.

52
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:37.000
Now let's get started with the first portion of this course where we look at some advanced

53
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.160
use case scenarios for making changes to the metahuman face and body using the DNA calibration

54
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.959
library.
