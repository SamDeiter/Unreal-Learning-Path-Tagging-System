00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
In this section of our course, we will be looking at advanced use case scenarios where

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.160
DNA calibration has been used to make changes to the metahuman head and body.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.000
We will have a look at the scripts that were demonstrated at the 2023 UnrealFest DNA calibration

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.800
deep dive, and then we will look at the modified version of the UnrealFest script and the custom

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.760
body integration workflow that were used for the stylized atomic savage character.

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.520
So let's begin with the UnrealFest DNA calibration scripts.

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.320
The 2023 UnrealFest DNA calibration deep dive presentation, delivered by part of the three-lateral

8
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.120
team, demonstrated what can be achieved with the DNA calibration library.

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.640
Each piece of code from the calibration and scale script was explained in great detail,

10
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.480
and all of the steps for bringing in the modified DNA file and head LOD-FBX files into Unreal

11
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.199
Engine were shown.

12
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.479
These scripts allow the user to edit the neutral pose and scale the entire rig.

13
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.799
They contain a combination of commands that allow users to transfer details from a provided

14
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.719
model, snap surface joints to their new vertex positions, change the animated map setup, scale

15
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:25.000
the body and the head, update the metahuman DNA file, and export the head LODs with material

16
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.679
placeholders.

17
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.920
If you have not seen this presentation, I highly recommend you watch it and practice

18
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760
using those scripts and the provided assets.

19
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.760
I have included a link to the presentation in the resources section of this course.

20
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.640
Now let's take a look at the scripts that were used for the stylized atomic savage character.

21
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.040
The stylized atomic savage character's body and facial features went beyond the standard

22
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800
metahuman template.

23
00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.819
The first script called atomic sDNA-calibe that was used is a modified version of the

24
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.439
Unreal Fest calibration script.

25
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.560
This version of the script transfers details from the fitted head geometry models to the

26
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.840
neutral pose and updates the DNA file.

27
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.000
The DNA file that was generated from that script was used with the custom body integration

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.840
script to merge the head with the custom metahuman body for a seamless integration.

29
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.099
The custom body workflow aligns the head and body skeletons.

30
00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.920
It eliminates any seam issues that may occur during deformations, and it saves those changes

31
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.960
to a new DNA file.

32
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.879
This workflow uses multiple scripts and commands that are executed through a single script.

33
00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.199
We will be using both of these scripts, and as mentioned, these scripts and their associated

34
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:48.000
assets are located in the source files folder of this course.

35
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.680
Now that we have looked at what the Unreal Fest script allows users to achieve along

36
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.259
with the two scripts that were used with atomic savage, let's move on to the next section

37
00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.879
of our course where we will explore all of the steps for taking atomic savage from an

38
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.680
initial concept to a finalized metahuman character.
