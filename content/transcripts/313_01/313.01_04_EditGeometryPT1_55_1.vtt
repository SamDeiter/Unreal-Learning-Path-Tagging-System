00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this section, we will be delving into the first DNA calibration workflow that was used with Atomic Savage.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The Atomic S DNA Calib script is a modified version of the UnrealFest calibration script.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This script allows us to edit the metahuman neutral pose by transferring the details from the fitted head geometry assets to the metahuman identity,

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then saves those changes to the metahuman DNA file.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We will first go over the script input, the path settings, the constants, and how to execute the script.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So let's get started by reviewing the workflow.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The script we will be using is named Atomic S DNA Calib.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you want to follow along, you can find the script and all of the associated assets that are needed to run it in the folder named Atomic S located in the source files folder.

9
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This script allows us to move, scale, and transform the rig to adequate positions using the values that were identified with the locator.

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It saves the current vertex and surface joint positions as a JSON file, then it updates the neutral mesh using the fitted head geometry OBJ files,

11
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it sets the new vertex positions and snaps the surface joints to their new positions, then it updates the DNA file to include the change in deltas.

12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now as we go over how to use the script, we will primarily work in Maya.

13
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
As we complete portions of this workflow, I will review the completed steps.

14
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So let's jump into Maya and begin by looking at the script and the assets that we will be using.

15
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Inside of Maya, let's begin by going over the script and assets that we will be using for this workflow.

16
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:58.000
To locate the script and assets in the source files folder, navigate to the DNA Calib assets folder, then to the Atomic S from geometry folder.

17
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They will be inside of the folder named Atomic S. The Atomic S DNA Calib script is in the script folder.

18
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I have added it in the script editor in a new Python window.

19
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now let's go over the setting paths that this script will use in order to locate specific assets from the work directory folder.

20
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
On line 10, for the root directory, enter the path that points to the DNA calibration folder.

21
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In my case, it's on my C drive.

22
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The work directory refers to the location of the Atomic S folder which contains the assets that this script will use.

23
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I have placed this on my D drive.

24
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Next, add quotations to the Maya version you are using.

25
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In my case, I'm using 2023.

26
00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, if we scroll past all of these surface joints and all the way down here past this code to line 657, this section has the setting paths that will be used.

27
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We already have an output folder and a temp folder.

28
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Inside of the output folder, I have added a folder that contains the exported FBX and final DNA generated from this script.

29
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
For the character DNA, the path is pointed to the DNA called Atomic Savage in the DNA folder.

30
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Below is a list of the neutral meshes.

31
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
These are the names of the fitted head geometry OBJ files in the model folder.

32
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There is also a copy of the prepared body skeleton Maya scene in here.

33
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The temp folder is where the JSON file will be added when the vertex and surface joints are saved and it also contains a copy of the prepared body skeleton Maya scene.

34
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Over here, on line 699, this will be the name and path of the final DNA.

35
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And here is the path to the prepared body skeleton Maya file, which is in the temp folder.

36
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.000
For the scene files, the GUI and additional assembly script paths have already been set to point to the MH4 folder for the latest version of MetaHuman.

37
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
If we go over here to line 712, these are the constants.

38
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
For the fitted geometry OBJ files in the model folder, the mesh mapping names correspond to the name of the assets as they appear in Maya.

39
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
On line 731, this is the name of the character.

40
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, you can technically just run this entire script, but we are going to go through this one step at a time so that we can better understand what each command does.

41
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now, before we move on, let's do a quick review of what we just covered.

42
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
To use this script, for the root directory input, enter the path that points to the DNA calibration folder.

43
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
For the work directory, enter the path that points to the atomic S folder.

44
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Ensure you add quotations to the Maya version you are using.

45
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The paths for the GUI and additional assembly script are already directed to the MH4 folder for the updated rigs.

46
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Now, let's go over the path settings.

47
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The first setting path that is used for this script is the character DNA.

48
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This path points to the atomic S DNA folder.

49
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Next is the setting path for the new neutral meshes.

50
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This path points to the model folder with the fitted head geometry assets.

51
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Finally, the body file path points to the temp folder where the prepared body skeleton Maya scene is located.

52
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I am mentioning these paths in the event you decide to use your own custom metahuman character.

53
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You will want to ensure that the location of your assets match the paths that the script is using.

54
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This includes the naming of constants.

55
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Let's take a look at those.

56
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
For the fitted geometry assets in the model folder, the mesh mapping names correspond to the names of the assets as they appear in Maya.

57
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:22.000
For example, if I add the head LOD0 obj file to a Maya scene, in the Outliner, its name will appear as head LOD0 identity solve.

58
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is important because if the naming is not the same, then the assets will not be loaded into the Maya scene when they are needed.

59
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Now that we have gone over the assets and the input paths that are needed for the script, let's move on to the next section where we will execute the script.
