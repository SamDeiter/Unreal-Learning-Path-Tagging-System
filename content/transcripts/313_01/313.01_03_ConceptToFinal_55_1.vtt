00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this section of our course, we will take a look at all of the workflows that were used for the atomic savage character.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The process of bringing atomic savage to life began with an initial concept.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then came the question, is it possible to take a stylized character like atomic savage and transform him into a fully functioning metahuman?

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And if so, what steps would need to be taken in order to achieve this?

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So let's begin by looking at the first step of this character's journey.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The first step was to take the initial concept of this character and have a sculpted version created using ZBrush.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The head and body were then separated.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Using the topology of a metahuman preset, the metahuman head was fitted to the 3D sculpt.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The metahuman identity texture was used to ensure that important edges and loops for the head were respected.

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Once the initial fitting was complete, the next step was to generate a metahuman identity.

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The 3D head model fitted with metahuman topology was used with a mesh-to-metahuman workflow using the template mesh option to generate the initial metahuman identity.

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The template mesh option helped to get the initial geometry and joint positioning closer to the target delta across all the LODs.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
However, due to the scale and stylized features of this character, there was still more work to be done.

14
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The next step was to assemble and prepare this character's assets for the final fitting process.

15
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The source assets of the initial metahuman identity were downloaded from the Quixel Bridge standalone application.

16
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Then the LOD0 of the head geometry and the additional assets were refitted vertex by vertex to match precisely with the fitted 3D head mesh while using LOD2 for easier manipulation of polygons.

17
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Once the final fitting process was complete, the next step was to identify the scale and positional measurements for the head that would be applied with DNA calibration.

18
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
To identify the scale and positional measurements, in Maya, a locator was used to preserve the existing translation values of the joints.

19
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Once the locator was used to scale, translate, and rotate the metahuman identity, the values from this process could be applied to the metahuman identity with DNA calibration.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
To demonstrate the process of using a locator, let's jump into Maya for a moment.

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Inside of Maya, I will walk you through the steps of how to use a locator to identify the scale and positional values while preserving the existing translation values of the joints.

22
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now I have already loaded the DNA file into a new Maya scene and then added the fitted head mesh in here as a reference.

23
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me show you what steps I took in order to assemble the scene.

24
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
To load the DNA, I executed the DNA viewer run in Maya script.

25
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If I pull up the DNA viewer window, I loaded the DNA file of the initial metahuman identity for atomic savage.

26
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you wish to go through these steps, you can find the DNA file I am using in the source files folder.

27
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It is located in the Atomic-S DNA folder.

28
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
With the DNA loaded, I assembled only the head LOD zero mesh.

29
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In the build options, I enabled the joints and skin clusters, and then I selected process.

30
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And once this was assembled, I added the fitted 3D head model.

31
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now that I have gone over how I assembled the scene, let's go over how to use a locator.

32
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I am going to go to the head group and collapse it and select spine 4.

33
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Over here on the right, we can see that this has existing values.

34
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
To preserve these, we can use a locator.

35
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000
To do this, I will go to create, then down here, and I will select locator.

36
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:29.000
In the outliner, I will make the locator a child of the head group, and then make spine 4 a child of the locator.

37
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, we can use a locator to scale and translate the identity while preserving the existing translation values of the spine.

38
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I will unhide the fitted head mesh to use this as a reference, and I will select the locator.

39
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, I already have the values that are needed, but to demonstrate what this process would look like, I will switch over to wireframe for a moment.

40
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Then over here, for the translation x, I will set this to negative .106.

41
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
For the y, I will set this to negative 18.954.

42
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And for the z, I will set this to negative 20.869.

43
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Then for the scaling, I will change all three values to 1.192.

44
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Finally, for the rotate x, I will set this to 5.858.

45
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It takes a little trial and error to figure these values out.

46
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.000
However, once you have the right values, you will notice that this is a very close approximation of the scale and proportions the head will need to have in order to match up with the target head mesh.

47
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now that we have seen what this process looks like, let's do a quick review of these steps before we move on.

48
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We just saw how we can use a locator to identify the scale and positional values that will need to be applied to the metahuman identity with DNA calibration.

49
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The steps for using a locator are to use the DNA viewer run in Maya script to load the DNA of the metahuman identity.

50
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:26.000
In the DNA viewer window, assemble the LOD0 head mesh only and enable the joints and skin clusters in the build options.

51
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Once the scene has been assembled, add the fitted head model into the scene for reference.

52
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
To create a locator, go to create and select locator.

53
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Make the locator a child of the head group, then make spine 4 a child of the locator, and then use the locator to move and scale the identity in order to find the desired values.

54
00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:03.000
For atomic savage, once these values were identified, the next step was to prepare the body skeleton Maya file that is required for exporting the head LODs as FBX.

55
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The images on this slide show the progression of steps that were taken to prepare the body skeleton Maya file asset.

56
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The first step was to take the original full body rig Maya file from the source assets downloaded from bridge.

57
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
From root to spine 4, all of these joints must be perfectly aligned with the head rig.

58
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So for this reason, without touching the bones from spine 4 and above, spine 1, 2, and 3 were slightly adjusted while leaving everything else the same.

59
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Then, using the same workflow for preparing the body skeleton that we covered in our previous course, the arms and legs were removed, and this prepared body skeleton Maya file was ready to be used with DNA calibration.

60
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The final step for preparing the assets that would be used with DNA calibration was to rig the custom metahuman body.

61
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
To rig the custom metahuman body, the prepared body skeleton was used as a base for the height.

62
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
From there, the joints with the exception of the spine were adjusted to fit the upper portion of the custom body.

63
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Then, the arm and leg joints of the initial metahuman identity skeleton were bound to the skeleton and then adjusted to fit the rest of the body.

64
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We can see in the images on the slide what the skeleton looked like before and after this process.

65
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now, with all of the assets ready to be used with DNA calibration, the first script that would be used is the modified version of the UnrealFest calibration script.

66
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The modified version of the UnrealFest calibration script scales the head and transfers the details from the fitted geometry to the DNA.

67
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The script scales, translates, and rotates the head using the values that were identified with the locator.

68
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It then updates the neutral head by transferring the details from the fitted geometry assets.

69
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Then it snaps the surface joints to their new positions, which is important especially for those details to be preserved for lower LODs.

70
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And finally, it saves these changes to the DNA file.

71
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:30.000
In the images from left to right, we see what the initial metahuman identity looked like before DNA calibration and what it looked like after the script was executed.

72
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And all the way on the right is an image of the head LOD0FBX.

73
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Even though the head geometry and additional assets were finalized, the head skeleton and custom body still needed to be aligned, while also avoiding any seam issues that commonly arise from this process.

74
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
To achieve this, the custom body integration workflow script was used.

75
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The custom body integration workflow script aligns the skeletons for the head and body.

76
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It saves those changes to the DNA file and exports the head LODs as FBX with material placeholders.

77
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It also paints weights for the neck seam where the head and body connect, eliminating seam issues.

78
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
The only other step after using this workflow was to match the normals for the head and body neck seam area.

79
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The images on this slide show the skeleton before and after this script was used.

80
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Now, the final DNA file and the exported head LOD FBX files, along with the custom metahuman body with the adjusted skin weights on the neck seam area, were ready to be brought into Unreal Engine.

81
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
All of the finalized assets for the head and body were brought into Unreal Engine and configured.

82
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The head LODs and updated DNA were re-imported, the body skeleton was imported and assigned to the metahuman-based skeleton, and the metahuman blueprint was updated.

83
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The face and body were then tested with animations, and it was during the testing process it became apparent that due to the significant differences in skeleton proportions,

84
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
animations would need to be retargeted from the standard metahuman-based skeleton to the custom body one,

85
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and body correctives would be needed to finalize this character's customizations.

86
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:33.000
When applying animations to the body, due to the significant differences in skeleton proportions, animations had to be retargeted even though the source and target skeletons shared the metahuman-based skeleton.

87
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
To correct problematic areas during deformation, the pose driver connect tool set was used to author corrective poses.

88
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A good example of this is demonstrated in the images on the bottom of the slide where we can see what the shoulder and neck region looks like when animations are applied.

89
00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now, we have just seen how atomic savage went from a concept to a fully functioning metahuman, and we touched on the various workflows that were used to finalize this character.

90
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
In the next portion of our course, we delve deeper into the DNA calibration workflows that were used with this character.
