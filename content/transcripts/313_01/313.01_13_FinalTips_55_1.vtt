00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this portion of our course, we will go over some final recommendations.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.080
I will provide you with some tips and resources for you to use as you continue your work in

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.160
training with metahumans.

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.719
We will first go over how to troubleshoot certain issues you may encounter.

5
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.920
Then we will take a look at how to import and assign body correctives that have been

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.440
authored using the PoseDriverConnect toolset.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.679
And we will finish off by looking at some resources related to the topics discussed in this course.

8
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.439
So let's first go over some troubleshooting tips.

9
00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.520
In this section, we will take a look at how to troubleshoot certain issues that you may

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.579
encounter at various stages of the workflows we covered.

11
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.960
We will go over how to handle issues with shaders, re-importing the head-LOD-FBX files,

12
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.040
and material conflicts.

13
00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.280
We will also touch upon considerations when using the DNA calibration custom body workflow.

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.840
So let's begin with troubleshooting shader issues.

15
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.359
The images below show the preset Lina that was modified using the UnrealFest DNA calibration script.

16
00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:16.640
When applying facial animations, you may encounter the shader issue she has on her upper eyelids.

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.879
To fix this, you can recompute the tangents for the green channel of the head shader.

18
00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:29.200
Open up the face skeletal mesh, and in the asset details panel, locate the LOD0 sections.

19
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.640
Section 0 is the head shader.

20
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.920
Go to the recompute tangents dropdown and change it to green, and this will resolve the issue.

21
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.560
Let's take a look at another issue you may encounter when re-importing the head-LOD-FBX files.

22
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.040
Depending on the engine version you are using, you may encounter issues when using the re-import with new file option.

23
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.200
When re-importing the head-LOD-FBX file, using the re-import with new file option,

24
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000
if the process of importing the file takes a very long time and nothing happens,

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.439
you can paste the interchange feature flags import-FBX command with the value of 0 into the command prompt,

26
00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.319
and then select the re-import with new file again.

27
00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.519
For engine versions 5.4 and earlier, in order for the FBX import option window to appear,

28
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.560
when re-importing with the new file, you will need to go to the editor preferences and search for re-import.

29
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.079
Then go to miscellaneous and enable show import dialog at re-import.

30
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:43.120
When you are importing the LOD0 head-FBX, you may see a conflict show up in the re-import content window.

31
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:49.039
A material conflict may occur if you have named the head geometry assets incorrectly.

32
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.080
Select reset to FBX to resolve the conflict.

33
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.920
Another conflict you may encounter is for unmatched skeleton joints.

34
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.280
This may occur if you use the export FBX script from the DNA calibration examples folder

35
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.400
to export a newer version of MetaHuman.

36
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.759
Make note of it and proceed.

37
00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.079
Now let's go over some considerations when using the DNA calibration custom body workflow.

38
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.719
The current version of the custom body workflow does not update the lower head LOD additional assets.

39
00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:29.519
The additional assets will not be scaled and translated with the head geometry asset.

40
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.639
If you are planning to use LOD0 only, this will be fine.

41
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.919
If you are going to need the lower LODs, consider using the AtomicSDNA calibration script

42
00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:46.399
to scale and translate the DNA and then use the custom body workflow for aligning the skeletons.

43
00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:54.039
Use the DNA file that is generated from the AtomicSDNA calibration workflow with the custom body workflow.

44
00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:58.919
For step one, you will not have to do anything with the position and scaled mesh.

45
00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.199
And for step two, you can use the LOD0 head mesh as the new neutral mesh

46
00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.839
if the neck vertex positions have already been authored.

47
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.079
Now let's move on to the final section of our course

48
00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.000
where we will go over how to import and assign body correctives to a MetaHuman character.
