00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.679
In this section, we will go over how to import a custom metahuman body skeletal mesh into

2
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.179
Unreal Engine and configure it.

3
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.380
If you wish to go through the steps, the custom body skeletal mesh is located in the source

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.760
files folder of our course in the custom body working export folder.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.320
Now, let's jump back into Unreal Engine and go over the steps for importing a custom metahuman

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.120
body.

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.120
Right of Unreal Engine, I am going to go through the steps of importing the custom body FBX

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.120
file.

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.520
First, I will navigate to the body folder.

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.640
Next, I will go to import and in the export folder, I am going to select the Atomic-S

11
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.200
body export skin weights FBX file.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.680
Since I used the interchange feature flags command earlier, the FBX import options window

13
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.840
will appear instead of the import content window.

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.200
In the FBX import options window, I am going to assign the metahuman base skeleton over

15
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.920
here.

16
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.120
Since the body FBX file was exported in YUP, I want to make sure the import rotation is

17
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.680
still set to 90 degrees.

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.439
And I also want to make sure that import animations is checked off.

19
00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.480
Now I can select import.

20
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.040
I am going to save everything now.

21
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.640
Next, I am going to double click on the skeletal mesh to open it up.

22
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.719
Now, we want to assign a material to this.

23
00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.320
So I will go back to the main viewport and select our metahuman in the level.

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.719
In the details panel, I will select the body component.

25
00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.679
And then I will locate the material and navigate to it using this folder icon.

26
00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.799
With this selected, I will return back to the skeletal mesh window.

27
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.840
In the asset details panel in the materials slot, I will assign the body material instance

28
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.319
to this.

29
00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:13.439
Next, I will scroll all the way down here to locate the default animating rig.

30
00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.319
I will assign the metahuman control rig for the body here.

31
00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.359
I will use this drop down arrow and then locate it and select it.

32
00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.919
If you have an animation blueprint that is set up with body correctives, I will show

33
00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.359
you where you can assign that.

34
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.879
I will scroll back to the top of the asset details panel.

35
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.079
For the post process animation blueprint slot, I will use the drop down arrow and I will

36
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.000
select the animBP RBF correctives blueprint.

37
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.400
And if you wish to inspect this blueprint, you can find it in the course assets folder

38
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.560
in the atomic savage folder.

39
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280
I will delve into this animation blueprint later, but for now it is worth noting that

40
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.960
it uses corrective poses that have been authored using the pose driver connect toolset.

41
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.120
Now let's do a quick review of the steps we just went through before we move on.

42
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.159
We just went over how to import a custom metahuman body into Unreal Engine.

43
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.319
In the import options, under the common section, we want to change the offset rotation to 90

44
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.560
degrees if the skeletal mesh is in Y up.

45
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.039
Next, we want to assign the metahuman base skeleton under the common skeletal meshes

46
00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.039
and animation section.

47
00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:36.000
And under the animation section, we want to ensure that import animations is checked

48
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.159
off and then we can select import.

49
00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.479
Once the skeletal mesh has been imported, the next step is to configure it.

50
00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.479
Inside of the skeletal mesh window, in the asset details panel, we can assign a material

51
00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.159
to the body.

52
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.400
Then we want to assign the metahuman control rig for the default animating rig.

53
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.359
If you have authored corrective poses using the pose driver connect toolset and have created

54
00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.159
an animation blueprint with those, you can assign that to the post process animation

55
00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.000
blueprint slot under the skeletal mesh section.

56
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.079
Now the images on the top right demonstrate what the shoulder area looks like within without

57
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.399
corrective poses.

58
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.879
Once we have imported all of the modified assets and finalized our character, the last

59
00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.879
step is to test the character by applying animations to it.

60
00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.519
In the next section, we will test the face and body with animations and check to make

61
00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.720
sure that everything is behaving correctly.
