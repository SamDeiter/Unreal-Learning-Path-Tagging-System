  "text": " There's many ways in which you can reroute. There's also another one called AddNamedRerouteDeclarationNode. Makes it so that you can actually not have to have a noodle fest everywhere. You can actually say, hey, this is for the multiply of the albedo tent. You can name it such. Then you can have that same node down below, which will actually bridge and act as that node. That makes it so that you don't have to have a cross. It almost looks like a teleport bridge, but that's a little bit more advanced. We're not necessarily going to get into it here, but I wanted to point that out. There's several ways to be able to tackle that. Now, let's go ahead and build the rest of this material. Over here, we have a roughness. We can also grab a metallic from that material. Let's see if he's going to come up here. He should still be over here in this content browser. There he is. We can grab a material from here. It doesn't have to be really anything in particular. We don't have to have metallic, but I'll just show you just so they can see what metallic looks like. We're going to steal the AO for that. Pull that in so that we just have an example between the rough and the metallic. You can see a little bit comparable of some little cheats that I'm going to show you here. Let's go ahead and get that metallic up and running. Again, we're just cheating and using the AO for that. We're going to go and expose his convert to parameter. We're going to call this metal or metallic. We can even call it fake because we're using AO. It's not really the metallic in here. We're going to keep my finger on the M key, apply, and I keep my finger on the S key, which is going to be like a already converted parameter constant. Keep my finger on the S key. Here we go. This is just an exposed constant. If you have the one key here, if I hit the one key, that's a constant. This parameter here, the scalar parameter is basically an exposed constant. It's converted so that it's exposed and we can edit it. I'm going to call this metal intensity. We'll set that to one. We talked about those concepts before. Put that here in the B channel, put this metallic fake into the A channel, and then go right into metallic. Don't forget to group these. In this particular group, we can just call this metal. There we go. We can also group the same thing with this scalar node that we're using. There we go. Pretty simple stuff. There's also specular though. We talked about specular. We're going to get a little bit into it later. If you want to be able to control that, just simply do a scalar for it and just call it spec. If you don't want any spec, just keep it at zero and put it in right there. Otherwise, the default is going to be 0.5. Let's go and make the rough. We're going to go to this rough here, and we'll go and build that out. Now, the nice thing about using a scalar parameter, you notice my metal intensity, it has one. Really, for this, we can keep this as a slide max of one. The same thing we could do with roughness, but the nice thing about it is you can cheat a little bit with rough. If I wanted to, I'll make a scalar, and we'll call this rough intensity. This rough intensity can be set to like a negative five. Actually, let's make it a five, my bad. Then slider minimum, we'll leave it at zero, and then maximum value or a default value would do one. You can cheat a little bit. Normally, it's going to be a zero to one, but the multiply for some reason with rough, you can cheat. You can actually make a higher range if you want to. If you don't feel like putting in a value of 0.00.5, I mean, it's a little helpful. It's just like a little cheat, it's not a big deal, but you can actually with rough go a little bit higher with your number range. It's up to you. We'll move this a little bit over. I can double-click on any node, like the reroute node, to simply get there without having to create a reroute node. When you double-click, you can instantly make one if you need to move things around. I'm going to move this around, it's just a little bit crossing over. All right. If you want to, we can increase that value to five because that is the maximum, and you'll see it change, believe it or not. Zero, one, and five. You'll see we're cheating because normally it's just a zero, one. Nifty, nifty, nifty. We go to our normals here, let's go and expose this. We're going to right-click and we're going to convert that to a parameter. I'm going to call this normal. With this normal, we also want to create a thing called the flatten normal. Now, you'll see this on some tutorials online where people will use the flatten normal, may not. This is something we normally use for our workflows at Epic Games. If you wanted to invert the normal, you have the option. Otherwise, you could just keep your finger on the M key and just create a multiply and then maybe create a scalar or create a constant and plug that right into the B and just control it that way if you wanted to. But you will see many times on some of our demonstrations and some of our workflows and maybe even some of our sample content, we'll have a flat normal in here with a minus one. Now, this is not necessarily intuitive for artists. It might seem a little weird. What it does, it makes it so the flatten normal starts at a reasonable range because what happens is it comes in kind of in like a negative range. So this minus one flips it, so it puts it back to a flat neutral position. And I'm going to put this RGB into the normal there. And then finally, I can create a scalar parameter and we'll call this normal, normal control. And I'll set the maximum on this guy to a five. Minimum to a one. Or actually default. Yeah, actually, that's my default five and minimum one. There we go. I was looking at it, but typing in the wrong spot. Now that we got that, we get our normal control, put it right into that negative slot there or minus one and pull that right into the normal. There we go. Pretty cool. That came out really, really, really nice. Let's organize it a bit more. So normal, we need to put them in a normal group. And we'll put his scalar parameter also in the normal category. We'll do the same thing here with the roughness, we need to convert that to a parameter. Keeping things organized, we'll put this in a roughness group. We'll do the same thing here, just pull down, because we already typed it in roughness, all organized. Cool. So if we hit save now. We'll go to our in class instance. And now you'll see we have an obito section. We have a spec control. We have a metallic section, a normal section. And we also have rough and intensity here. Pretty great. And if we go to our viewport, we can see that there and we can control these aspects on the fly. So if I wanted to lower my normal and increase my normal, I can. If I want to lower my roughness and increase my roughness, I can. Pretty awesome. My normal can even be converted to a negative, hence default. So the minimum could be a negative five if we wanted. So if we wanted to, we have the option to now invert it. So if I wanted to go to my normal and go all the way to negative five and go inside out if we wanted to. And all that updates on the fly. And what I mean by that, if we go to this instance. And drag it into our scene. We can now change these aspects. Without having to recompile. Look at that. And these aspects are animatable, believe it or not. No recompiling, changing on the fly, and then we can change whatever texture that we need according to our needs for the scene. Pretty cool. So using instances allows us to create more variations in our material and have full control. And here are some links in our slide deck, which give you some more information on material and the control that you have. Go ahead and try this on your own and create a master material and an instance material. In the next section, we're going to be animating materials and see how that workflow comes about.",
