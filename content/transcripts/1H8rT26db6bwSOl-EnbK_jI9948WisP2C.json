  "text": " Now let's talk about using the river tools inside of Unreal Engine. So we'll hop back into our editor again. And then with our empty map selected again, I'm just going to type in water. This time we want the river tool. So let's get the water body river. And you can see we've already got some spline points wanting to be dropped here. So to use a river tool as well, when we create our landscape, we click the enable edit layers option. So this is very much needed for this river tool. So make sure if you're not seeing the river, it's probably because when you created the landscape, you didn't tick the little box enable edit layers. So just make sure that's enabled. And then we can just drag our water around in the map. So to control the length and the path of the river, you just need to add more spline points here. So generally the tool inside of Unreal Engine when adding spline points is to hold down alt. So I'm just going to select the last spline point here. I'm just going to hold down alt on my keyboard and drag out. And then it will create an additional spline point. And you can imagine if we just spent more time with this river now, we can then kind of create U-bends or any kind of erosion effects. And we can basically just bend the river however we want it. And of course, you can select any existing spline point, manipulate that. So we can also right click on a spline point and add a spline point as well. There are the right click properties here. And again, we can just adjust the settings. You'll start to get more familiar with the fall off settings and the curl settings and just really dialing in all these options to get the desired results that you want in your projects. It's worth noting that when you have a spline point selected, there'll be selected points here. And so you can control the number of the velocity, for example, by clicking on each spline point. So then we can affect the depth and the width of the river based on the spline point. So you can just drop down this water section here. And again, this is going to be per spline point. So make sure to note the velocity input as that controls how fast the water is moving. So when we actually have our river down here, and again, this is going to be per spline point. So you want to be selecting the point. But say we did want to go from 128 to 300 and the river is flowing faster. This may be a bend that you specifically want to flow faster and then it slows down again. But again, if you want this to then flow to 300, we just need to make sure we keep that consistent and keep that water flowing. So you can see we have depth, the width, the velocity, even audio intensity, which we won't cover in this section, but you can obviously play around with those settings. But hopefully that gives you a good idea about how to use the River Tool. And in combination with oceans and lakes, you should be able to get some really nice organic effects for your projects. Thanks for watching.",
