  "text": " Okay, so we've talked a lot about specific lighting setups, but we've not really talked too much about reflections, so part of what makes a convincing lighting solution are going to be the reflections. So let's go ahead and take a look at what we're going to be looking at with this section of the course. We'll be taking a look at reflection pros themselves and when to use them, the types of reflections that you can get, scenarios for reflections, the building quality of the reflections themselves, and some tips and tricks. So, when should we use reflection captures? They're to be used with primarily reflective surfaces more than anything, and the idea is to give the illusion of believable reflective material or substance. If you do not use the reflection capture actor, as you can see here, Unreal is going to go ahead and use screen space reflection as a default. Using a reflection capture will create and give you more detailed believable reflections, and you can find this actor under modes and visual effects. The types that can be used are the following. Screen space reflections are going to be the default, spherical reflections, box reflections, and planar reflections. Now, it's important to understand that reflection captures are only needed when you're using lightmass and bacon lighting. They are not needed for ray traced reflections, but they can help. They have real-time reflections when using ray tracing, and no re-bacon is needed, but a hybrid of both can be used to help performance if you need to. Now, what type of reflections can you have? You have screen space reflections. It's Unreal Engine 5's old default reflections system. We now use lumen. Lumen reflections are actually now going to be on probably by default, but you can edit them, in this case, by creating a post-process volume, and you can control the intensity, quality, and roughness. To affect the whole scene, you just need to set your post-process volume to infinite bounds, and it's just one column below in the screen space settings. You've got sphere and box reflections. They use one bacon lights. You can control the influence and radius of how strong the range of reflection can be. By default, the source type is set to captured scene, and you can customize the reflection via a cube map if you want to add your own cube map that you've generated yourself. It's important to note that the reflection capture will use the texture as a source, and the brightness can be controlled if you find that your reflections are a little bit too dark. So it is a fairly versatile system. We've also got planar reflections. UE4 and now UE5 also have support for real-time planar reflections, which can give you more accurate reflections than screen space reflections, and they're actually really good for flat surfaces like water, for example. The high render cost of this particular type of reflection is due to how they work. They actually render the level again on the opposite direction of the reflection, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Planar reflection is fairly expensive due to its nature. You've also got scenarios. The use case for these is pretty logical based on the reflection type. If your model is square in nature and the reflection is close to the original shape, you can use a box reflection, and then you can also use a sphere reflection if you have some more curved surfaces or highly distorted surfaces like puddles, water, glasses, a glass sculpture, anything like that that you can think of. The sphere capture will always have a curve on the edge that may be seen at the right angle, but again, keep that in mind. If you don't have a highly reflective surface, it's not going to be a huge issue, but just keep that in mind. Now, when it comes to quality control and building settings that we need to keep in mind, every time you move, create, or delete a reflection capture, you'll have to rebuild, because they get all converted into an atlas, essentially. Unreal Engine will automatically rebuild reflections when you build light, so that's something to keep in mind. This is kind of handy as well, but you can build reflections on their own. To control the resolution of your reflections, you need to go to your project settings and set them to 1K or 2K if you need higher quality, but this is something you really only need if you're trying to go for a realistic setting, and also if you're using a ray-trace hybrid. Tips that I can give you when it comes to reflections. They're not calculated in any ray-trace scenario, so it's a bit of an illusion of detail, but again, it's a good fallback to get quality, but overall, it's useful for baking lights. When custom-making your own reflections, just keep in mind, do not go too high with the resolution. Keeping it at 1K or 2K is the most ideal, since the higher the resolution, the higher the cost. In most cases, unless you're having mirror-like surfaces, you can get away with blurrier reflections in general, so just keep that in mind.",
