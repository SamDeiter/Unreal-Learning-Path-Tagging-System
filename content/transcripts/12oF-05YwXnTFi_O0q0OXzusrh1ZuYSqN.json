  "text": " Welcome back. We are going to start combining several animations using the Blend Multi-Node. And by the end of the animation blend control section, we will have quite literally Frankenstein a bunch of different animations and use that to create a Frankenstein walk. So for starters, we'll combine the idle walk and run animations to create a limp walk. And that will form the basis of our creation. So first, let's disconnect the Blend Node, alt click on that wire, move the output pose down and then right click in an empty space, type in Blend. This time grab the Blend Multi-Node. There we go. Now it looks pretty similar to the Blend Node, but the inputs have different names. We've got pose zero, pose one. We've got an additional alpha value right there. But we can also add additional inputs. So if I right click on the Blend Multi-Node, it's a little bit hidden, but you just do the right click at the very bottom is this Add Blend pin. So go ahead and click on that. So now we can add the run animation and we've got an additional alpha value as well. If you ever need to remove an animation pin, you can just right click on the name of the input and remove Blend pin. But I want to keep it, so let's leave it be. But just wanted you to know how to do that. And then let's go ahead and hook up the idle run. So the idle first, let's do the idle with pose zero. And then let's do the walk next. Drag that on top of pose one and then the run on pose two. Okay. Now I'll just try and spread that out a little bit and then hook up the Blend Multi to the output pose. If I hit compile, our character snaps to a pose because all the alphas are zero, which makes sense. Now these values, at least with the Blend Multi-Node, they don't have to add up to one. So for instance, if I set all of these to one, in fact, and compile, I'm essentially want all of these animations to have the same influence. So we've got a 33% influence of each of these animations. So the Blend Multi-Node, it figures out the math for you. But this is a little bit of a mess right now. I think we should play with these numbers a bit more to get something closer to what we want. So what if we try 1.5 and 0.2? And that's, you know, still a little bit jerky. But there's another feature we can take advantage of to try and synchronize these animations a bit better. They're fighting each other right now. So what if I like the pacing of the walk and the run, but I want the idle to adjust its timing to be in line with one or more other animations? So if I click on the play third person idle node, and I look at the details panel, there's this sync group feature. So if I expand that, let me create a whole new sync group. I'll just change the name from none to, I don't know, something like Franken sync, and I'll use that name for each of the nodes. And I want that one to always follow the walk and the run. So I'll make this one always follower. And really this process, it just takes some trial and error. So feel free to play with these. For the third person walk, let's also use the Franken sync so that they'll actually talk to each other. And I want that one to keep its timing. And let's do the same for the third person run. We'll call it Franken sync. And then let's make sure it's always the leader. Let me double check what I did for the third person walk. I want that to always be the leader. There we go. And then if we compile, that actually looks okay. It's like there's a little bit of a hitch in the walk. And I think a Frankenstein might have a bit of a limp. So I'm actually really happy with this. And I will pan down and let us look at these nodes a bit better. And the last thing we need to do is record the newly created animation so we can use it and build off of it later. And we're not going to worry about creating this perfect looping animation. Instead we'll just record a longer section so that it's less likely to repeat. So what we'll do is just hit the record red button right here. And then it's going to ask us where we want to save this. I'm going to put it in mannequin animations. Let's call it limp walk. Okay. There we go. You can see the number of seconds. And then as soon as I see 10 seconds, I'll hit stop. So eight, nine, 10. Okay, stop. And then we see this little pop up window down here in the bottom right. Or you can see the new limp walk in your asset browser. We can double click a limp walk and hit play and inspect it. And there it is. We'll use it later. So now is an excellent time to save all. So we can do save or we can do control shift S and that will save everything. Great. And that's pretty much it for the blend multi-node. In the next video, we will take a slight detour and talk about some blend nodes that are using gameplay logic to drive animation transitions.",
