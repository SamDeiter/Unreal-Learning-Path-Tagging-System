  "text": " In this part of optimization view modes, I'd like to talk about lighting complexity as lighting complexity shows you how many non-static lights you have affecting your geometry. Now remember, a non-static light is a light that is dynamic or can move around and interact with the scene in real time. Now the more non-static lights you have affecting any piece of geometry, the more expensive it will be to render. Red means areas are going to have performance issues, and as we start to hit red to light purple, dark purple, and then on to white, this is going to be very expensive to render. So this is definitely something we need to look at. Now, again, as with most of our optimization view modes, the goal here is to identify possible areas and see what we can do to help adjust them in order to get some performance back. However, we don't want to make black and white decisions. For example, we don't need to have the scene that's ideal to moderate, as the car is the only object in the scene at this time. So because of that, we get away with going to the more expensive and very expensive, and also every scene is unique. So again, these tools are used to help us make better judgments. And let's go ahead and jump into the engine and see an example of that. So here we have that exact same scene, and if I come over to my lit optimization view modes, lighting complexity, and remember, Alt-7 is the keyboard shortcut. Look at that. That is just insane. Everything is white. That's really not going to work for us. So what we're going to do first is I'm going to hit the G key on my keyboard, and then I'm going to come here and start selecting lights, and let's see what's going on. So first off, these lights right here that I selected, they have an attenuation radius of about 1.5 inches. And let's go ahead and just click on this effects world. It looks like they're here just to highlight this wheel a little bit more. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take these down to say 50. All right, so with that done, let's just see what that did. Let's just come here to our lighting complexity and see. OK, that didn't really do too much, but I do know that we are well on our way to making some adjustments to the lighting complexity. So let's grab this light next. So this is a box light, and look how big its radius is. Its radius actually goes all the way out into the world. And what we're going to do with this one is we're going to bring this back down. I'm actually going to bring it quite far in, because it looks like if I was to disable this, it's really just to kind of highlight this side of the car. So having it go all the way through like this, is probably not something that we necessarily want. Also, it gives us really hard shadow in the background, and that doesn't really happen anywhere else in the scene. So I'm going to bring this back in and check this out. When I bring this back in and kind of just make sure that it's right around the car, I go back to my optimization view modes. And I'm still not getting so much, but we are getting some in this area. So let's kind of continue on, because I'm sure there's some other lights that we can do. So let's check out this one right here. Attenuation radius 2500. So that's pretty large too. That's going all the way out there. Let's go back. OK, so this looks like, again, it's trying to get the front right there. So we're just going to bring this down. It's about right there. There we go. Let's see. What else can we do? Let's grab the spotlight. So it looks like it's actually going through the floor. So again, we'll just take this attenuation radius and bring this up, because it looks like it's probably going through the front of the car. And bring this up, because it looks like it's probably going right there for that highlight, the front kind of right there. You can see it's giving it a little bit of just a little bit extra light. There we go. Something like that. Nice. All right. Let's just check this out one more time, because this is a process that is iterative. So still getting a lot of red in there, or a lot of white, I should say. Let's see what else we can do over here. So we fixed these ones. Let's check this one out. So what is this? Sorts. This was a big one. So let's go ahead and see what this is doing really quick by just disabling it and enabling it. So it's casting on the back here. So let's just bring this down some more, because it looks like, oh, yeah, that was definitely affecting everything in the scene. Let's go back here. See our optimization view modes. Still not crazy expensive. So let's keep on going with these. This one's got a huge attenuation radius as well. And it's only for the other side of the car. So there we go. Maybe like that. See what we're doing with our lighting complexity now. Still pretty complex, but look, we're getting better on the sides here. So let's keep going. We have these inner lights here. All right. Looks like these inner lights. Let me just grab these really quick. And let's go ahead and see what affects the world. So these are just these are to kind of brighten up the inside of the car. And their attenuation radius is set to a thousand. So let's set these to like 50. And let's just see. Like 75. That definitely looks like they're doing their job. And let's go back and check our attenuation or not our attenuation. I'm sorry. Lighting complexity again. Oh my gosh. Look at that. So there we go. That was our culprit. That definitely helped us out quite a bit. So that was the kind of the one final thing that we had to bring in to help really just make sure that we can run this scene appropriately. So that's a good frame rate while while not destroying the art quality of it. Now, the last thing I want to note about this too is I'm going to come back to one of these lights. A very important thing is this casting shadows enabling and disabling casting shadows is going to have a huge performance impact on any dynamic light that you use. Just as a rule of thumb, if you want a dynamic light or your lighting complexity to improve drastically, you can also disable cast shadows and that'll have a huge performance impact on that particular light.",
