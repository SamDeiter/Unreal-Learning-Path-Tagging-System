  "text": " Now that we've gone over blueprints, we're next going to take a look really quickly at Unreal Motion Graphics or UMG to understand more about what it is as we're going to be using this tool with the accompanying workshop. So what is UMG? Well, UMG or Unreal Motion Graphics is a visual UI authoring tool that could be used to create UI elements such as in-game HUDs, menus or other interface related graphics you wish to present to your users. You can use UMG to create menus, full screens or pop ups, HUDs and even 3D displays. Right here is an image of the UMG editor and the editor itself is actually broken up into a couple of different tools. There's two different tools. There's designer which we see right here. The designer is broken up into the following little areas here. One, we have the palette. This is where we're going to find all of the pre-built UI elements that we want to work with. So the great thing about this is that we can pull in something like a generic button. You can either use the existing imagery or bring in all of our own imagery. This is really handy because we don't actually have to worry about building code to make a button. We simply just bring in different common UI elements like buttons and images and sliders and things like that. Then we can use those to do things in our UI. Underneath our palette here we have our hierarchy which is going to show us the hierarchy of this UI. So if we have a bunch of buttons here it will show us the buttons and if we have things nested underneath those buttons it will show us what those items are. Three in the middle, this is going to be our UI preview area. What we do with our UMG widgets is we bring these common elements into three right here and then we can place them around the scene in order to make them more in line with our UI needs. Finally, or I shouldn't say finally, but next we have four which is our details panel. The details panel is context sensitive so that means that based on what we have selected the details inside of here are going to be different but this is how we modify the properties of these common elements that we put inside of our UI right here. Last but not least is number five which is our animations. This allows us to animate objects so if I was to click on this we'd get a little animation window coming up and while we're not going to be utilizing this in today's tutorial it is nice to know that we can fully animate all of our UI elements, their positions, but we can also animate their visibility or we can make them fly up and then get bigger or smaller. So there are lots of cool things that we can do with that. Now the second part of our tool is called the graph so I like to refer to them like this. The designer is how we make our UI pretty. The graph is how we make our UI functional. If you notice that this actually looks very similar to a blueprint and that's because you are actually using blueprints to build your UI. So over here under the my blueprint this is where we're going to find different functions that we have built or right now we're seeing pre-existing functions in there. We can also override and add variables and things like that. Two is our details panel and again this is context sensitive so based on what we have selected the details is going to be different and then three is our event graph and this is going to work exactly the same like the event graph does inside of blueprints. We're going to put down various nodes inside of here and then based off of the events that happen when those nodes are clicked on we will then do things. So for example if we were to be inside of our, I'm going to click back to our designer here, inside of our designer we could put something like a button here and then on that button we're going to have a little behavior that says on clicked. So when we press that we'll see that inside of our event graph here we'll have a little on clicked that will allow us to then execute some code. So this might look overwhelming or a little daunting. Do not worry you're going to see how easy these tools are to use and how much blueprints and UMG all have together in our workshop which we're going to start right after this slide.",
