00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
So to close out this course, let's talk a little bit about lighting in Unreal Engine.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.960
So we have some lighting definitions and types.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920
We talk a little bit about static versus dynamic and then also the different lighting types

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.220
that you can see inside of Unreal.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.680
So the lighting definitions might be useful to start off with here.

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.720
So direct lighting is light that falls onto a surface without any interference.

7
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.900
Light travels directly to the surface and the surface receives a full color spectrum

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.900
of light.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.280
So that's direct lighting in Unreal Engine.

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.360
Indirect or balanced lighting is lighting that has been then reflected by the surfaces

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
nearby.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.960
So you can see in the bottom right hand corner here, we've got some indirect lighting that

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.020
is almost lifting that backside of the sphere to give it a bit of balanced light off the

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.040
floor onto the sphere to give you a nicer more realistic effect.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.800
So as light bounces off these surfaces, light waves are absorbed or reflected based on

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.120
the surface properties and passed to the surface you're looking at.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.480
So again, when we're talking about PBR and we're talking about surface properties, this

18
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.080
all plays a part in getting your realistic lighting and how much metallic and roughness

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.560
and the bounce lighting that you have going on.

20
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.520
All these properties work together to get your desired lighting result.

21
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.000
So indirect lighting contributes to the mood and overall light intensity.

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.820
When we talk about shadows, shadows happen when Unreal Engine takes a snapshot of a mesh

23
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.640
from a light's point of view and projects that information onto another mesh actor on

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460
the opposite side.

25
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.480
So you can toggle lights between static and dynamic lighting.

26
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.000
Bait lighting is pre-computed rendered lighting.

27
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.600
Bait lighting is created using Unreal Lightmass, a radiosity baker.

28
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
And similar to rendering lighting in V-Ray or Corona or any of the other lighting tools

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.560
that you might be used to, it's used to create high quality indirect lighting using light

30
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.760
and shadow maps and it's baked lighting cannot be altered at runtime.

31
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.800
Because it's been pre-computed, you can edit that at runtime because all the light maps

32
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.720
and shadow maps have been baked in pre-rendered.

33
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.200
It has little impact on real-time performance with that.

34
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.440
So if you're worried about performance and you want all the lighting controlled and baked,

35
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.600
that's the route to take.

36
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.680
Your real-time, in quotations, dynamic lighting is a type of lighting that is updated with

37
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
each frame.

38
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
It's fully dynamic and can be moved around and modified at runtime.

39
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.200
Historically it has no global illumination component, only a direct light.

40
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.960
It can also be really expensive.

41
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.680
You want to make sure there's not too many overlapping real-time dynamic lights.

42
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.120
Unreal Engine can use both static and dynamic lighting in comparison.

43
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.960
You don't have to pre-select whether you want all static or all dynamic.

44
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.440
You can have, say, 85% you've seen static with 15% dynamic lighting where you might

45
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
need it.

46
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:10.320
So for archviz projects, typically stationary, which is kind of an intermediary between static

47
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.400
and dynamic.

48
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.920
So stationary lighting inside of Unreal Engine is baked lighting that can accommodate dynamic

49
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.200
actors.

50
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.320
Ray tracing is a type of real-time lighting.

51
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.240
Its global illumination is updated with all lights set to movable.

52
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.720
If they are animated, the global illumination updates on the fly.

53
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.640
But ray tracing is worth noting, requires advanced GPU hardware.

54
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.960
So when we have our different light types that we're talking about, this place actors

55
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.560
tab in our editor, as we saw when we were looking at the geometry tab before, you have

56
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.900
a light tab and you can see all the different lights that you can select from.

57
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.680
So when we're talking about directional light, which is essentially a sunlight or a moonlight

58
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.440
source, you can drag and drop directional lights into your map.

59
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.880
You've got point lights, which are omni lights, spotlights, rectangle lights, skylights.

60
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.360
Laser can catch in the environment, HDR image based ambient light.

61
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.720
HDR backdrops, which is a blueprint that helps you set up the light in your scene based on

62
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.520
a HDR image.

63
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.280
And the sun sky, which is a new feature in Unreal Engine, is a blueprint that automates

64
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.640
the sun position in the sky based on geographical location.

65
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.800
So if you want realistic time of day, that sun sky tool will really help you out very

66
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.760
quickly.

67
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.440
So the data and components, all the things that we require in the scene, we have a light

68
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.200
source for the sun, generally a directional light, atmosphere, preferably linked to the

69
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.680
sun to adapt its position.

70
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.360
And then we also have a post-process volume, which is around the scene that can adjust

71
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.280
the lighting solution, another end in aspects.

72
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.920
So the post-process volume, again, we have courses on this in more detail, but essentially

73
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.600
a post-process volume can be placed around a scene if you want it just within this specific

74
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.880
place to affect the rendering aspects.

75
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.280
You can actually, on the post-process volume, if you have one in your scene and you type

76
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.920
unbound, you can actually say this post-process should impact the entire world if you wanted

77
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920
to.

78
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920
So have a play around with post-processing.

79
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.960
There's a lot of powerful functionality there.

80
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.320
And then optional things are skylights to contribute to global illumination, a sky dome

81
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.160
for a backdrop visual.

82
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.600
You can have volumetric clouds.

83
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800
And if you want to use a light mass importance volume, you can.

84
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.440
It's only needed for baked lighting and not needed when using lumens.

85
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.760
So if you want to control your scene with static lighting, light mass importance volume

86
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.600
will really help those bake times and give you the best quality static lighting.

87
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.400
But essentially you can see all the different components in this diagram to help you set

88
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.520
up the scenes in the way that you would like.
