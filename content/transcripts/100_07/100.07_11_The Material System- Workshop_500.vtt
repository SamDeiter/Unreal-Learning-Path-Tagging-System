1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
With my editor open, I'm just going to create a new folder for this.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.380
You can put the material wherever you'd like but for this purpose I'm just going to create

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.460
a new material folder here and hit materials.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.460
So all I've done here is right clicked on the content folder, new folder and it's created

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.940
a materials folder.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.380
Alternatively, I can also in the root just right click new folder as well if you prefer

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.480
to take that approach.

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.020
So inside my materials folder on the bottom left here, I want to create a new material.

9
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.960
So I'm just going to right click in this empty space at the bottom.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.200
So right click material and I use the naming convention m underscore and then whatever

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.340
the material is.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.680
So let's just call this rock.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.740
So m underscore rock is my naming convention.

14
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.040
Some people put mat underscore for material.

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.340
Whatever you'd prefer, again from the outset we were talking about good naming conventions

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.500
and being consistent with naming conventions.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.160
I think just pick a naming convention that works for you or your team and then just keep

18
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.800
that consistent.

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.560
So I've just hit enter there and it's opened my material.

20
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.240
If you didn't have, again just open my content drawer by pressing control and space bar.

21
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.260
If I didn't have this material selected already, I can double click it as well to open it.

22
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.460
So we see the material editor and the slide that we're referring to before and this is

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.600
the basic outline.

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.940
So the first thing we'll do is we'll hold the number 3 key down and left click and that

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.300
will create a vector 3.

26
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.180
So holding down 3 on your keyboard and left clicking will create a vector 3 and I'm just

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.420
going to plug this into base color.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.300
I'm going to click on the constant value on the left hand side.

29
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.020
So constant, this black box and we'll just give it a color, whatever color you like.

30
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.940
I'm going to create a purple rock today or a pinkish rock shall we say.

31
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.620
I'm just going to save that.

32
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.840
It's always good to just save as you go.

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.700
Just keep working as you're iterating and I'll also change the property here just so

34
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.540
I can see my material a little bit better.

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.220
So I'm going to set it on the preview mesh here and then using the exact same editor

36
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.100
viewport navigation that I was using before, so right mouse drag goes in and out, left

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.200
mouse drag pans around and both zooms in and out.

38
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.740
So in case you want to do that.

39
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.320
So you can toggle the different view modes if need be and just make sure if it goes invisible

40
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.800
that you're not right next to it.

41
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:52.080
So next I'm going to hold down 1 and left click to create a numerical vector here and

42
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.400
I'm going to plug that into metallic and I'm going to press 1 again, hold that down and

43
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.320
I'm going to plug into roughness.

44
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.220
So I'm just holding down 1, left mouse clicking to create these values.

45
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.880
Now you'll see my color here.

46
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.420
I'm going to right click on the color and convert this to a parameter and I'll call

47
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.140
this rock color and I spell color the British way, apologies for that and I'm just going

48
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.100
to move that into location.

49
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.040
I'm just left mouse dragging and holding these into position.

50
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.100
So left mouse click and hold down to move them into position.

51
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.360
I'm going to right click this next metallic one and you can probably guess what's going

52
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360
to happen next.

53
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.680
I'm going to convert to a parameter and go to metallic and we all spell that the same

54
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.960
way and then the same thing again.

55
00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:01.120
So I'm going to right click on roughness, convert to a parameter, call that roughness.

56
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.920
Now I'll save again just to make sure everything's lined up and I think what I'll

57
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.500
do is I'll change the roughness metallic value by default.

58
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.300
So metallic value we mentioned is either 0 or 1 in the previous slide.

59
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.760
So let's go to the default value here and let's just hit 1 for now and you'll see that

60
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.980
it changes to a more metallic looking material.

61
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.920
So just to show you the before and after, 0 and 1.

62
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.300
So we've got a much more metal looking surface which we probably don't want for rock but

63
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.720
I'll just show you in this example anyway.

64
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.760
Maybe it's a precious type of rock.

65
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.860
And then roughness, let's put the roughness value at 0.5.

66
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.820
Somewhere in the middle gives us a bit more roughness.

67
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.720
So you can see as the roughness is dialing up it looks, it still looks metallic but it's

68
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.560
got a rougher surface so it's not as shiny which is probably what we want for an unpolished

69
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560
rock anyway.

70
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.380
So we've got rock color, we've got metallic and we've got roughness.

71
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.080
Now I can close this and if I open my content browser by hitting control and space bar,

72
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.860
I might actually apply this to a surface here.

73
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.860
So if you've just got a default surface in your scene, if you've created just an empty

74
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.280
scene you could go to your shapes tab and drag and drop in a cube maybe if you wanted

75
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.920
to drag and drop a cube in.

76
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.420
We've got some basic geometry in the place actors here.

77
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.620
So shapes, cubes, sphere, whatever you want to do.

78
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.300
I'm going to press control and space bar and I'm going to get the rock material, I'm going

79
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.820
to drag and drop it.

80
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.680
And you'll be able to see we've got this material inside the editor here.

81
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.180
You'll see it preparing shaders on the bottom right hand side here and that's just figuring

82
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.280
out how it's rendering this object.

83
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.600
You can also see that there's a materials section here whenever you select a mesh.

84
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.180
Now I could have quite equally if I just clear out this value by resetting this value, you

85
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.900
don't need to do this but it goes back to its default value.

86
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.940
I can make sure I select rock in my content browser, go back to select this and just plug

87
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.220
it in using this and it assigns it as well.

88
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.840
So whether you drag and drop or you assign it here, it's completely up to you.

89
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.220
Maybe if you're assigning it here we can go back and add it to the favorites at the

90
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.320
top, that would also be okay.

91
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.340
But for now I think that's fine.

92
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.520
The power now comes in material instances.

93
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.940
So we've got our main material which is our parent material, we've not really defined

94
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.440
it as parent, it's just inherently a parent because it's a material.

95
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.700
Now let's create a child from this parent.

96
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.620
So I'm going to right click the rock and go to create material instance.

97
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.420
So I'm going to create material instance and you can go with the naming convention

98
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.420
that gives you.

99
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.800
So it goes m underscore rock underscore inst or you could rename it.

100
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.900
I sometimes go mi rock underscore o1 for example.

101
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.740
So mi for material instance, rock for the rock and then o1 because I might be creating

102
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.740
multiple of these.

103
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.620
Now if you want to rename something you can hit F2 with it selected or right click rename

104
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.380
as well if you wanted to rename it from its default value.

105
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.500
I'm going to double click the material instance now and we'll see that this is a condensed

106
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.360
version of the material editor.

107
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.500
We can see our material here.

108
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.820
We don't have the node graph but what we do have are these vector and scalar parameter

109
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.160
values that we added previously through the rock color, the metal and the roughness.

110
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.140
So we can actually tick the rock color, tick the roughness, tick the metallic.

111
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.980
Well actually let's not tick the metallic for example because we know metallic either

112
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.380
wants to be one or zero and I don't think I'm going to edit this.

113
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.860
I think I'm going to leave all my material instances at one as metallic.

114
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.940
So I don't, I mean you can leave it ticked to never change it but I'm just for demonstration

115
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.460
purposes I won't tick metallic just because we're not going to edit that.

116
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.060
So let's go to rock color and maybe we found instead of an amethyst style rock maybe we

117
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.740
found a different, maybe you get rubies or whatever color you feel like going to and

118
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.740
hit OK.

119
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:27.260
And maybe I ramp that roughness up to make it more rough and I'll save that.

120
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:33.700
I'm going to close it and maybe I duplicate this object by holding down Alt on my keyboard

121
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.300
and left mouse dragging.

122
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.420
Alternatively I could drag and drop another cube in but just to get familiar with these

123
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.460
shortcuts it might be worth doing.

124
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.260
So I'm going to open my content drawer again.

125
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.540
I've got my rock here.

126
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.340
Maybe I'll drag and drop it onto this object and you'll see that now I've got two different

127
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.060
color of rocks and the power now comes.

128
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.380
I can just right click duplicate and it goes to rock 02.

129
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.380
It automatically names it the next one.

130
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.260
I'm going to double click this.

131
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.880
Maybe I'm going to click the color.

132
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.220
Maybe I'll go to blue.

133
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.740
Maybe I'll hit OK.

134
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.060
Maybe I'll change the roughness to zero and it's a really shiny rock.

135
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:17.900
I'm going to save it, close it and duplicate holding Alt and left mouse drag and you can

136
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.220
see that I've got my rock selected there.

137
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.740
Maybe this time I'll just plug it in through here.

138
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.260
So again I'm just trying to move faster now just so you can see that once you've got that

139
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.860
base material set up you can start working very quickly and very efficiently using these

140
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.820
material instances and the reason why the material instances have these editable properties

141
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:49.300
if I go back into my main rock is because we created these scalar parameters.

142
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:56.020
So again just a reminder I held down one and left clicked and by default it hasn't got

143
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.020
anything.

144
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:02.020
So I'm going to right click, convert it to a parameter which then allows you to give

145
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.540
it a name.

146
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.740
This name doesn't have to be roughness.

147
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.860
That roughness doesn't need to align.

148
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.940
If I called this roughness value for example and press save I wouldn't even need to call

149
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940
it roughness value.

150
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.940
I could call it anything I wanted.

151
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.900
I could call it zebra if I wanted and if I double click the material instance you can

152
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.840
see roughness value now.

153
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.400
So the name doesn't have to correlate with the actual thing that you're editing.

154
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.760
It's more just so you know exactly what you're editing.

155
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.680
So hopefully that gives you a good idea about materials and material instances and then

156
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.680
the power that you can get out of them by instancing and changing the properties per

157
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.400
instance.
