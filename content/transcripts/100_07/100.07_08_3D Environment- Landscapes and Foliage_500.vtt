00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Next up, talking a little bit about 3D environment, the landscapes and the foliage.

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.280
In Unreal Engine, we have a very powerful landscape tool and as well a foliage tool

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.240
that you can add terrain, trees, shrubs, other types of vegetation to.

4
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.200
Again, touching upon the modes tab that we were talking about before, you can select

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.640
these directly from this tab at the top left of your editor.

6
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.520
You'll be able to find that and you can also see the hotkeys for shifting between them.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.360
So we have specific courses on this but you can sculpt the terrain, vary the foliage,

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.800
you can scatter foliage.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.120
They're very intuitive tools and there is a lot of documentation on using them as well

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.480
if you like but sometimes it can be nice to just jump in and play around with those tools

11
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480
yourself.

12
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.800
Like I said, they are very intuitive and you can get a lot of really powerful results in

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.120
a really short space of time.

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.880
We can also just delete and move foliage around if you've accidentally put it in the wrong place.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.000
So many powerful options in landscape and foliage so they're worth checking out if you

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.280
need those for your projects.
