00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400
So, looking at the material system in a little bit more depth here, we've got the material

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.740
editor overview which you can see which is just a buildup of the base color, the metallic

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.720
and the roughness that we were looking at previously where you can see some text quads

4
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.520
going on with texture samples and roughness values and we've got normal maps going on

5
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.360
with some baked ambient occlusion as well and so I'll jump into the editor and show

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.440
you a basic material set up in a second and just to talk to you about the parent materials

7
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.000
and the material instances, essentially we can have this parent material which is from

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.280
the slide previously that can be a parent material so we can say this is a parent rock

9
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.240
material and these are all the properties that we want and as you can see roughness

10
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.480
for example is a value here which we'll actually be able to manipulate in a child version of

11
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.120
the material so we can have parent materials and material instances which are child versions

12
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.440
of that material so we could set a roughness value in the parent material for example and

13
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.440
then using that same material we can create instances of that to have you know materials

14
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.900
with different roughnesses for example which is really powerful and it gives it a better

15
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.420
more optimized workflow as well. So material instances come with all the same properties

16
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.100
as a parent material and you can you know enable and disable them and right now we'll

17
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.700
jump into the editor and to show you a basic material set up, how to author a material

18
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.220
and get it working with a material instance inside your editor.
