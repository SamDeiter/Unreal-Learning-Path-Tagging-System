00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Probably useful to touch upon the Unreal Engine file structure to give you a little bit more

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.100
idea about how the projects are stored and saved.

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.160
So to give you a brief overview, Unreal Engine has projects and templates.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.260
Within that you have project files.

5
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.800
Within the project files you have the folders and also the project structure.

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.920
So breaking apart each one of these points here.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.520
When we refer to projects and templates we're talking about when you load the launcher and

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.640
you want to create a new project, you can see the different series of templates that

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
we can choose from on the left hand side.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.760
So we can either pick a games based project, film and video based project, architecture

11
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.640
in this instance and then automotive, product design and manufacturing.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.040
So essentially each one of these categories gives you a series of different templates to pick.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Now it actually doesn't matter which project you pick if you want to change.

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.600
Unreal Engine can accommodate just because you pick one template doesn't mean that you're

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.440
committed to that one specific approach.

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.080
However it just pre-builds in some quality of life settings.

17
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.280
It kind of sets all the different features and functionalities you might need with that

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560
given project.

19
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.000
So it's just useful to be able to pick the template from the get go when you're creating your projects.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.720
So when we talk about file saving and copying you have the traditional apps used for a single

21
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.080
project to visualize the scene.

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.800
So in this instance we have the piece of software, we click save and we have a file that is created.

23
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.240
So you know when you're working in Photoshop you have PSDs, Word, you have Docs, you may

24
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.200
have made binary files and so you're essentially in the traditional apps.

25
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.660
You have a piece of software and you are saving this file to visualize your scene.

26
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.360
When we talk about UE5 all important assets you know this is models, textures, audio,

27
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.280
anything along those lines are stored in a content folder as UAsset.

28
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.800
So essentially UAsset is just an Unreal Engine asset and it allows you to see things on an

29
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.340
individual basis.

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.660
So levels are saved as UMaps which essentially is an Unreal Map and projects are saved as

31
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.700
U projects.

32
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.900
So to give you a better idea about that the project is the main thing that you have created.

33
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.460
It is what stores all the individual assets below that.

34
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.780
So the project is the thing that embodies everything else.

35
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.260
When you create your scenes or levels they are saved as UMaps so they're saved as map

36
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260
projects.

37
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.460
So all the content is stored separately outside the map for easy access and you can access

38
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.080
them through the map which is inside the project.

39
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.520
So it's kind of a tiered approach there.

40
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.660
So with UE5 we have the level editor, the asset editor, the material editor, just looking

41
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.420
at this diagram here and each one that you save creates a different asset essentially.

42
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.900
So when we talk about aggregating the files in Maya or Photoshop you have FBXs and PNGs.

43
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.660
So these raw data files, the FBXs or the PNGs, they will then get transferred into a UAsset,

44
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.160
so an Unreal Asset.

45
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.860
So instead of using the raw naming convention then everything gets turned into a UAsset.

46
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.140
So when we look at the project folder structure generally you'll see these folders.

47
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.560
If you have a C++ engine version or anything like this you might see a few extra folders

48
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.620
in your file structure but these are the main folders to look for when creating your project.

49
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.660
So wherever you decide to store your projects maybe the defaults of the documents in Unreal

50
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.580
Projects sorry but essentially we've got the config folder here at the top which is,

51
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.740
houses all your configurations for the project.

52
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.900
So any kind of inputs or different post process settings maybe that you've saved, anything

53
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.480
that you've configured for that specific project are in the config folder.

54
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.180
The content is where all of these UAssets get stored which we were referring to before

55
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.840
whether a UAsset or maps and assets are stored in your content.

56
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.480
So essentially any content that you can edit at real time is in your content folder.

57
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.080
Intermediate and saved are more of the cached folders so intermediate just saves a bunch

58
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.520
of information that lets your engine run a bit faster and then saved if you have any

59
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.800
auto saves or maybe you've saved some screenshots in the engine, maybe you've saved some movie

60
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.960
exports that will generally all go into saved.

61
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.000
And then your UProject which is the blue icon is what you would load to load up the larger

62
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
project.

63
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.200
It's quite a small file size and that houses all of the folders above it.

64
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.560
We can access them through the UProject.

65
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.740
So to give you a little bit of a better idea about that you know the project encases everything

66
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.900
else the project is this holistic thing that holds all the information.

67
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.200
You will create levels within the project so that you can access through the editor

68
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.920
window and then each of these levels will have some form of actors which are these UAssets

69
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.480
inside of Unreal Engine that you can use to create the content that you desire.
