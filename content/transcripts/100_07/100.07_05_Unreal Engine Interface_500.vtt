WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
Now that we understand files and content workflows a little bit better, let's talk a little bit

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.120
about the Unreal Engine interface.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.400
So we have UI and components here made up of the toolbar, the modes panel, content browser,

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
viewport, world outline and details panel.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.720
So just to touch upon what each one of these is, on the top we've got the toolbar here

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.440
and you can select the different modes that you want to edit your scene in.

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.640
So whether you want to be in content editing mode with the assets that you're placing down,

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.840
whether you want to be in landscape mode or foliage mode, and we have a few different

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.160
modes to select from here.

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.800
And then we can also open the blueprints from this toolbar, we can create cinematics from

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.200
this toolbar and we can also play through the experience or package the project from

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
this toolbar as well.

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.560
So and also just save the project, which is a good habit to get into.

14
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.040
And we've got the modes pane on the left hand side here and then depending on which mode

15
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.680
you had selected from the toolbar, it will give you relevant options.

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.800
So as you're cycling through the different modes, this window will be updating with the

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.120
tools that are available at your disposal when going through the modes.

18
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.040
When we talk about the content browser at the bottom, this is where you're housing all

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.840
of your content that you've imported from your DCC app.

20
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.200
So depending on your naming conventions and your file structures, you'll be able to find

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.360
the relevant information.

22
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.560
And it's also worth noting that we have a filtering out of content.

23
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.720
So I'll just show you that quickly in the engine so you can see the filter because I

24
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.060
think that's useful to touch upon.

25
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.920
So if we're trying to find certain content inside of our content browser, there is a

26
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.260
favorites tab, first of all, which you can add favorites to.

27
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.240
That's quite a useful functionality.

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.000
Specifically on the filtering that I was talking about, if you're trying to find a level to

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.760
open which is inside your content, maybe you can scroll through to the relevant folders

30
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.240
and find the information that you need.

31
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800
Maybe you go to the levels tab and this is a level that I currently have open.

32
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.200
But if, for example, you've got your level saved in multiple places, I can actually filter

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.400
out this content either through searching the content, if you're using consistent prefixes

34
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.360
with your files, maybe you can search the prefix and find the content or you can actually

35
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.040
filter out the content based on the content type.

36
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.760
So you could select a blueprint to find blueprints.

37
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.000
I've selected level here and if I click level, it actually creates this level filter here

38
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.840
and it shows all the levels.

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.600
And because I've got content selected, which is the parent folder, it actually shows me

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.200
all the levels that are present within this project.

41
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.080
So if you need a quicker way to find your content, obviously good naming convention

42
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.000
and folder structure is the primary thing.

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.360
But if you are struggling to find certain bits of information, do consider using the

44
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.000
filter tab because it's very powerful and very useful when you're trying to find certain

45
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.040
bits of content.

46
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.200
And hopefully that gives you a little bit more idea about how to navigate the content

47
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
browser.

48
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.360
On the top right, we have the world outliner, which you'll see all the actors that are

49
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.000
in your scene will be present here, which you can scroll through.

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.280
You can create hierarchies here where you can child other actors to parents and just

51
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.720
also add folders and collect everything together and name everything correctly so your scene

52
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.120
is well organized.

53
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.460
You'll see that there's a layers and levels tab next to the world outliner there.

54
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.160
You can find these from the window option, sorry, at the top left of your editor next

55
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.260
to file, edit and then window.

56
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.940
And you can open different windows depending on what you need.

57
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.300
The layers tab, essentially you can add actors to layers that you can set the visibility

58
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.780
of so you can hide and unhide content at runtime.

59
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.820
And then levels tab is if you have streaming content, maybe if you want to stream in a

60
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.480
whole lot of content at a certain point through the experience, you can do that using levels.

61
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.420
But yeah, the world outliner is the main thing that we're highlighting there.

62
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.260
Then you've got your details panel at the bottom right here.

63
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.820
Again, you've got world settings next to the details panel, which you can find from the

64
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.620
window setting at the top left of the editor there.

65
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.300
But to specifically focus on the details panel, whenever you select an actor inside this scene,

66
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.660
inside the viewport, you can see the relevant details that you can edit.

67
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.200
So say for example, if you selected a static mesh in your scene, you'll be able to set

68
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.080
the material or the scale.

69
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.120
Maybe you want to set something specific to its rendering properties.

70
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.880
You can find all these options in the details panel.

71
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.380
And then finally, we've got the main viewport here.

72
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.080
So you navigate the viewport and again, using those hotkeys and quick tips that we had displayed

73
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.560
before, you'll be able to navigate through the scene.

74
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.000
We have viewport settings, which I'll touch upon in more detail in a second at the top

75
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.840
left of the viewport there where it says viewport settings.

76
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.360
And then you got your transform tools and snaps in the top right of the viewport where

77
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.520
you can cycle through scale, rotation and movement.

78
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.440
And so you can actually toggle through those transforms just pressing spacebar in your

79
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440
editor.

80
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.120
So if you have a static mesh selected and you tap spacebar, you can cycle through the

81
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.260
location rotation and scale widget.

82
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.200
It helps you really quickly manipulate the content there.

83
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.960
And you've also got different grid snapping properties, which you can change the grid

84
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.080
from 10 units to 5 units depending on the snapping.

85
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.480
And to give you a little bit of idea about this widget that I was referring to, if I

86
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.200
go over to a chair, for example, and I can see the pivot and again, just to navigate

87
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.600
touching on these hot tips that I was using before, I'm using right mouse button to pan

88
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600
my camera.

89
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.240
So just pressing and holding right mouse button.

90
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.000
I'm using my left mouse button to go backwards and forwards.

91
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.080
I'm holding down both mouse buttons to go up and down.

92
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.760
So you can see that as I move around, I'm just holding left click.

93
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.040
Now I'm holding right both and now I'm holding right mouse button.

94
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.720
So again, just cycle through the left mouse button, right mouse button and then both mouse

95
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.240
buttons to get a feel for navigating the scene.

96
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.120
But the specific toolbar that I was talking about is if I press spacebar, I can cycle

97
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.920
through the widgets here.

98
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.120
I can also set the snap sizes to 10, 5 and you'll see that 5 updates to 10, updates

99
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.200
to 15 and I'm actually using the bracket keys next to the enter key on my keyboard to actually

100
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.960
cycle that grid size, which I think is a really quick and useful way, especially when you're

101
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.420
working with a modular content that needs to snap together.

102
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.840
That can be really helpful when you're using the bracket keys.

103
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.120
And then you got rotation snapping, scaling snapping and also the camera speed.

104
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.760
So if you're navigating around your viewport, I'm holding down W, A, S and D on the keyboard

105
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.120
at different points to navigate around the scene.

106
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120
If you feel like your camera is moving too quickly, you can bring the camera speed down.

107
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.400
Alternatively, you can see I'm now moving quite slowly around the scene.

108
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.220
Alternatively, you can drag it up.

109
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.360
If you want something a little bit more dynamic as well, as I'm right, I'm pressing and holding

110
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.760
my right mouse button to pan around the scene.

111
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.680
I'm also pressing W, A, S and D to move around.

112
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.560
If I'm trying to get to a certain part, I can actually use my mouse wheel to zoom faster

113
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.160
and slower.

114
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.760
So if you're navigating around and you use your mouse wheel button, it can actually really

115
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.800
help you move around the scene a bit quicker.

116
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.480
So just a few tips there of navigating the editor just in case they were useful to you.
