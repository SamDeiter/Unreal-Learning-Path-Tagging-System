00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Moving on to your content workflow inside of Unreal Engine, the things I want to cover

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.680
here are working with the assets, so whether they're ready-made assets or custom assets,

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.880
importing FBX files and importing Datasmith files as well as the static mesh editor.

4
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.800
So a few useful shortcuts and hotkeys for viewport navigation inside of Unreal Engine

5
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.640
might be useful to either screenshot or just write some of these down.

6
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
Again, you'll probably get very familiar with Navigator Unreal pretty quickly, but these

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.440
are just some good navigation options to use when interfacing with Unreal Engine.

8
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.040
So when we're talking about readily available data, we have a starter content that's built

9
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.320
into the engine.

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.720
Now when we were creating these project templates before in the previous slides, there is an

11
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.280
option to include starter content or not include starter content.

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.920
So if you do include starter content, it comes with a whole bunch of assets that you can

13
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.120
use and edit in any way you like, and it contains a selection of sample assets such as meshes,

14
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.640
materials, textures, etc. to get you started.

15
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.400
These are all included within Unreal Engine, and they can be added when you create the

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.280
project and can also be added to the project at a later time.

17
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.680
So again, if you don't select that tick box that says include starter content, you can

18
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800
add these at a later point.

19
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.280
Again, as we were referring to when we were talking about templates and, you know, maybe

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.360
selecting a template and you wanting to change certain configurations of the template, you

21
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.600
can still do that.

22
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.240
It just takes a long, it's more of a roundabout way of doing it.

23
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.360
We also have the marketplace, which we mentioned in the Epic Games launcher at the start of

24
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.920
this course.

25
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.560
Commercially available asset data, even though it contains lots of free packs.

26
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.800
So you can download marketplace packs from your vault and add them to any of your Unreal

27
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.360
Engine projects.

28
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.840
So once you actually have found a marketplace asset, you can either just click add to project

29
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.120
from directly in the marketplace or when you're in your library, you'll see all the packs

30
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.160
that you previously downloaded or purchased and you can add those to the project at any

31
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
point.

32
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.480
So it's a really good way to just pull apart other people's content and figure out how

33
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.400
certain people have approached different things.

34
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.840
We also have Quixel Bridge inside the engine.

35
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.840
So this is free data accessible directly from the engine.

36
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.440
You can see on the top right here, we have an option on the drop down to go directly

37
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.420
to Quixel Bridge.

38
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.420
So there's an enormous library of assets, 3D assets, materials, textures, and you can

39
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.420
use them effortlessly in your projects.

40
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.780
And when we talk about custom content, a few things to do before you export from your DCC

41
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.780
app.

42
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.020
So you want to make sure you use descriptive names for objects and materials, just keeping

43
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.340
things really organized.

44
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.460
When we talk about things like collisions and hierarchies, it's just really, really

45
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.300
good practice to keep things.

46
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.740
Whatever naming convention you're using, just keep things organized and combine meshes wherever

47
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.020
possible.

48
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.340
Make sure all the meshes are clean and consistent with proper UVs.

49
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.500
When we're talking about clean, we're making sure that all our geometry is correct.

50
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.620
We've not got any inside faces or flip normals or anything like this.

51
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.500
Just make sure everything's clean and consistent with your proper UV layout and pay attention

52
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.080
to objects that have been scaled, especially in a non-uniform way.

53
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.280
Everything ideally is just a scale of 1, 1, 1 inside your DCC app.

54
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.600
And then when you import it, everything works as intended there.

55
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.280
Keep the scene as close to the origin of the world, which is 0, 0, 0 as possible.

56
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.000
As scenes move further away from world 0, the greater possibility for rounding errors

57
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to happen.

58
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So you may get graphical glitches and it's hard to reproduce those bugs, especially when

59
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.560
you're not sure what's causing it.

60
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.520
So again, when we talk about our custom content, just maintaining this good workflow is really

61
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.800
important.

62
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.040
And then check your pivot points and ensure they're in the right place.

63
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.640
So whether they've been center pivoted or maybe you have some building structures that

64
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.320
need their pivots on a certain corner to snap together, just make sure you're checking

65
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.120
all your pivot points before you export.

66
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.360
We can update pivot points in Unreal Engine, but it's better to have the actual data coming

67
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.840
in as you intend it to be.

68
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.960
So which road to take, whether we take FBX or Datasmith?

69
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.560
With FBX, mind your system units.

70
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.240
If you are planning to use FBX workflows, we use centimeters as a base unit in the DCC

71
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.600
app to match Unreal Engine's unit system so that your scales aren't off here.

72
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.000
And make sure your objects are centered in the world like we mentioned before with 0,

73
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.400
0, 0.

74
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.520
With Datasmith, you need to ensure that you have the Datasmith exporter for your DCC of

75
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560
choice.

76
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.520
So you can find a link here to all the different plugins that are available and just make sure

77
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.160
you download the relevant one for the software that you're using.

78
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.480
Don't worry about your DCC C units.

79
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.840
The Datasmith converter already takes care of everything on that front and it reads and

80
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.680
ports CAD formats natively.

81
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.200
Datasmith also works well with fully assembled scenes and large data sets and it's compatible

82
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.280
with more material types than FBX can provide.

83
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.320
And we can also export full scenes or partial ones.

84
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.000
The simple export UI defaults to export where it's only visible on the screen.

85
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.680
So again, when you're making your choice between FBX and Datasmith, it's worth keeping those

86
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.440
things in mind.
