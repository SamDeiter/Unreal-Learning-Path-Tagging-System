00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
So we'll talk a little bit about working with materials in Unreal Engine and if you're

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.160
unsure what materials are we'll dig into exactly what their role is inside of Unreal

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.080
and then after this section we'll jump into a little workshop where I'll show you actually

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.880
how to create a material.

5
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.060
So essentially what are materials in Unreal Engine and what is PBR?

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.260
So a material is essentially an asset that's applied to a mesh to control the visual look.

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.980
So if you see from this diagram here at the top maybe from the player's camera or the

8
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.260
viewer's camera we see some glass inside the editor.

9
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.100
Now the glass is reacting in a certain way, it's maybe causing a reflection, this is all

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740
the job of the material.

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.540
So the texture wouldn't be causing the reflection, it'd be the glass material which is causing

12
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.580
reflection and then the material also has some properties such as how the surface should

13
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.460
react so in this instance we're going to be bouncing light off the glass because it's

14
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.020
reflecting this sunlight in this figure.

15
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.580
And then for figure two for example if we want chalk which is more matted and it's absorbing

16
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.100
a lot more of the light you'll see that it's not bouncing off the surface as much and so

17
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.460
we can actually set the properties of the material inside of Unreal Engine to get the

18
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460
desired outcome that we want.

19
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.340
So the simplest form is we think of it as paint with various properties such as the

20
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.940
colour and the finish and the material defines how light interacts with the surface and it's

21
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.700
applied to.

22
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.260
So PBR is a unified lighting and shading system, it's a better approximation of light and

23
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.500
materials, physical interaction and hopefully you find it very intuitive and consistent

24
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.540
to use, it's physically accurate especially when you're working on these AAC projects,

25
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.380
it's very powerful in that respect and uses real world physical measurements.

26
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.100
So PBR is a combination of your material setup, what lighting setups you have in the scene

27
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.780
and also exposure.

28
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.500
So when we talk about PBR we'll talk about primary PBR inputs, material settings and

29
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.740
textures.

30
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.500
And so when we look at the PBR material setup and again we'll jump into the engine in the

31
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.580
next section just to actually create a material but to give you an idea when we open the material

32
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.660
editor we have a base colour, some form of base colour that we plug in and say this is

33
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.820
a blue material in this example.

34
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.520
We also can plug in a numerical value into a metallic value and a roughness value again

35
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.180
to say how metallic is this surface, how rough, how much is it absorbing light, how much is

36
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.220
it reflecting light and just controlling these properties give us a really powerful output

37
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.140
for our material setups.

38
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.220
So our base colour when we're plugging it into our materials is called an albedo map

39
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.820
which is a flat colour without any specularity or shading, it's linear RGB which is a vector

40
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.000
3 and values are between 0 and 1, avoiding a pure black which is 0 and pure white as

41
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.320
they don't really exist in nature, it's always going to be some variance of between

42
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.680
0 and 1.

43
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.800
When we talk about the metallic ranges it's a grayscale value that ranges between 0 and

44
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.240
1, most common usage is on or off so we either set metal on which is 1 or off which is 0

45
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.520
and when it's 1 it yields 100% specular reflection so you can see the transitioning value between

46
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.040
0 and 1 in the image below just to give you an idea of that.

47
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.840
When we talk about roughness, roughness is essentially a grayscale value that ranges

48
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.640
from 0 to 1 as well, it ranges from a smooth mirror-like surface from 0 so you can see

49
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.760
that on the bottom left hand side of our image here to a rougher matte surface which is 1

50
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760
on the bottom right.

51
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.600
Unlike with metallic you're encouraged to fine tune the roughness between 0 and 1 so

52
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.160
just play from your senior albedo map which is your base colour going into your metallic

53
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.280
map and then dialing in your roughness is a good workflow to look at there.

54
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.280
There's supported texture formats, so Unreal can handle many different file formats, for

55
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.280
optimisation purposes it's best to work with PNG when using image texture due to its lightweight

56
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.040
file size and its ability to have transparency info when needed but you can use uncompressed

57
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.800
file types, BMP, Targets, PSDs, it's good to note that Targets, depending on how you

58
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.400
save them in your editing suite, they can have the alpha channels with Targets which

59
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.400
is useful, PNGs are more compressed however they can support alpha as well as mentioned

60
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.960
before.

61
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.640
You can also import JPEGs, DDS and HDR.

62
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.920
So a few guidelines to keep in mind when you're importing your textures, textures should always

63
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.920
be a power of 2, so 16 by 16 all the way to 8192 by 8192, just keep them uniform there

64
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.440
and textures don't have to be square as long as they are a power of 2, so 16 by 128 is

65
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.160
completely fine, just making sure they are following that previous rule as a power of

66
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.160
2 and textures can affect streaming and memory management, so you know making sure, depending

67
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.400
on your optimisation, if you only need a small texture that's on this one small object in

68
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.400
the scene, maybe don't import it as 8192 by 8192, thinking about the scaling of the resolutions

69
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.000
there will help with memory management and high frequency textures can cause anti-aliasing

70
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
artifacts so you'll see when you import textures you get a few settings to show you how it's

71
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.400
been imported, how it's been displayed, different MIPS and formats and all these kind of properties

72
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.080
you can see the difference between streamed and un-streamed as well in those two dialogue

73
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.900
boxes there.

74
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.960
So when we talk about texture pyramids which are MIPS maps and custom settings you can

75
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.920
set these directly in the material editor and also from the texture, and again we'll

76
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.520
be jumping into the editor in a second, but the MIPS value mode is in the material editor

77
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.720
there which you can change the setting for and then if you double click the texture from

78
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.240
the content browser you can actually change the texture group if need be there, so there's

79
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.080
a couple of ways to use MIPS maps.

80
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.120
When you're importing the textures you can use the import button to simply drag and drop

81
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.040
in the Windows Explorer so you can either go through the method of clicking import and

82
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.560
adding content to your scene or you can just drag and drop them directly into the content

83
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.240
browser and they'll import fine.

84
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.060
Textures are converted to the U assets like we said at the outset here and you can open

85
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.700
a texture in the texture editor with a simple double click so from your content browser

86
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.960
just double click the texture that you've imported and you'll get this window on the

87
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.760
right hand side and here you can change the compression settings which we were referring

88
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.760
to before if need to and you can also enable or disable the linear colour space, the sRGB

89
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.240
there.
