So just to touch upon some Unreal Engine resources, you can find the Epic Games launcher on your

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.720
installer and it will give you a nice overview of everything that the engine has to offer.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.640
There is a samples tab where you can download different projects and break them apart.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.200
Sometimes that's the easiest way to really get into the depths of learning Unreal Engine.

5
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
You get the engine updates as well through this launcher.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.400
So if you're using a current engine version and there's a new one out, you can always download that through the launcher.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.000
We've got the marketplace and some free items so you can jump into the marketplace and grab some free content for your projects.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.800
And then we've also got the library files on the seconds last tab where your projects will be stored.
