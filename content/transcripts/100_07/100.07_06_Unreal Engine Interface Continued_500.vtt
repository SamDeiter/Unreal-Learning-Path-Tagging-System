00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
Coming back to the user interface, the customizable UI that we've got here, we've got a default

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.840
interface that favors a large viewport.

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.580
We can also, all panels are dockable and collapsible, and so we can move those into the real estate

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.580
that we want to on the screen.

5
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.280
We can also make parameters more accessible by adding them to a favorites list.

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.400
So you can, on the top right hand here, you can dock the outliner and the details panel,

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.720
and then also on the content browser at the bottom, you can hit control and space to open

8
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.720
that.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.600
So let's just jump in the editor and I'll show you the favorites and the docking.

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm going to hit F10 and that puts everything to the side so you can see everything is docked.

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.840
I can hit F10 again on my keyboard if I want to bring everything back out, or I can select

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.920
the individual options here and the outliner will pop out and the details panel will pop

13
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
out.

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.840
It depends on how you want to work.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.920
When we talk about the content drawer, I'm going to hold control and hit spacebar to

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.160
bring up my content drawer, and I can hit control and spacebar again to drop everything

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160
down.

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.920
I generally work with everything out, so if I hit F10 again, I generally work with everything

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.760
popped out just because it's easy to visualize everything.

20
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.600
The content browser is a really nice thing to have that can pop down and drop out again

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.600
though, just because it saves a bit more real estate space.

22
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.920
Then also on the favorites panel that I was referring to in the PowerPoint, say I navigate

23
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.680
myself over to a chair and you can see that I have favorites here that is cast shadow.

24
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.880
So on any of the properties, we can actually add as a favorite.

25
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
So you can just right click any property and click add to favorites and then that will

26
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680
favorite it up here.

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.880
So if I wanted to have the static mesh property as a favorite for example, I right click add

28
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.220
to favorites and it pops to the top there.

29
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.120
So I can still have all my properties down there.

30
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.520
It doesn't remove any properties from down here, but they will pop them up to the top

31
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.640
and you just want to make sure this toggle favorites button is there and you can just

32
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.360
essentially add any variables that you're constantly editing and if you find yourself

33
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.600
scrolling up and down to certain properties, just add them to your favorites list and they'll

34
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.760
appear at the top for easy editing.

35
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.640
It's probably also worth highlighting on the favorites panel here as well.

36
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.600
If I go to edit, editor preferences and I'll add editor preferences and I type in favorite.

37
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.200
There's also context menu, show favorite selection and also flatten favorite menus.

38
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.200
So if you wanted to flatten the favorite menus, for example, you could just tick that tick

39
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200
box and that might be a useful setting for you to have.
