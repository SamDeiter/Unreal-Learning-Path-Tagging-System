WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Moving on to transforming objects, we can use the translate, rotate, scale tools on

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.760
the viewport to move objects around the scene which I briefly spoke about in the viewport

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.040
overview.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.040
You can toggle between world and local transforms as well.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.360
So that is actually the little widget that's just here around my mouse next to the location,

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.320
rotation and scale widgets.

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.720
And then you can also use the details panel to enter transform values as we saw on the

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.560
options in the details panel, sorry, in the editor overview.

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.720
So you can just transform those values either through the widget or you can type in specific

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.120
values with each of the actors that you have selected.

11
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.480
So to give you a little bit idea about the viewport menu, so you can find these menus

12
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.680
at the top left of your viewport that we went over before, you'll see these four sections

13
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.600
here and each one contains a whole host of different settings that you may want to use

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.400
just to touch upon a few briefly.

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.080
Real time, generally you would have this enabled most of the time unless you didn't want the

16
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.200
scene in real time for some reason, maybe your computer can't support it or maybe you

17
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.680
just don't want to view the scene in real time.

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.240
So the good thing about all these settings is anything that you use frequently, they

19
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.240
have little hotkey shortcuts next to each property.

20
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.280
So if you want to learn a few of them for things that you use quite frequently, that's

21
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.840
a good practice to get into.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.200
But yeah, essentially we can just show a few different options here, you know, allow cinematic

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.400
control, do you want to show the toolbar, different properties that just create your

24
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.600
editing experience, make your editing experience a bit more user friendly.

25
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.840
In the perspective tab, generally we're working a lot of time in perspective, but if you want

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.200
orthographic viewports, for example, you can select through the different orthographic

27
00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.160
viewports there and you can also have a viewport layout that can house all four orthographic

28
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600
viewports, for example, if you wanted the three orthographic viewports plus a perspective.

29
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.280
If there are any cameras in your map, you'll be able to select your cameras from here.

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.400
I generally don't use this setting too often, I generally go and locate the camera in the

31
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.400
scene, but it's also worthwhile just to know that these cameras are placed here as well.

32
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.280
And then depending on if you want a default viewport or a cinematic viewport, majority

33
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440
of people will be using a default viewport.

34
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.880
However, a cinematic viewport gives you some nice cinematic controls, it gives you some

35
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.120
nice overlay masks, it gives you a third grid for your window if you're wanting to work

36
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120
on cinematic.

37
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.360
So definitely worth toggling on and playing around if you're making cinematics.

38
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.040
And then on the next button across, you've got the different view modes and render modes

39
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.320
and they have loads of different view modes that help with visualization of the buffer,

40
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.200
Nanae, optimization view modes.

41
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.160
If you're trying to get your project to a more optimized approach, you can toggle through

42
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.640
the different view modes here.

43
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.600
A lot of really useful things.

44
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.360
And it's worth noting that you can toggle a lot of these view modes using console commands,

45
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.800
which are opened by pressing the tilde key on your keyboard, which is more often than

46
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.080
not next to the number one key on your keyboard.

47
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.680
So much depth and complexity to the different view modes that are available inside of Unreal

48
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
Engine.

49
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.840
And if you're interested in any of those, it's definitely worth following up on the

50
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.000
documentation of those.

51
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.940
And then you've got some exposure settings if you want to override any exposure and then

52
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.960
your color management.

53
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.160
On the show tab next, this is just per editor viewport what you want to be displaying inside

54
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160
your scene.

55
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.800
So if you want to hide certain elements or features, it might be worth toggling some

56
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
of these options.

57
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.520
A nice little hotkey that isn't displayed here, I think is by pressing the T key, it

58
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.760
toggles transparency.

59
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.880
So if you have a lot of transparent surfaces in your scene, maybe you have a lot of windows

60
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.320
or god rays that are static meshes coming through, maybe there's just some kind of transparency

61
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.560
going on, which you just keep selecting the transparent objects instead of the actual

62
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.080
object you're trying to select.

63
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.680
You can hit the T key to toggle between transparency modes, which I find quite useful a lot of the time.
