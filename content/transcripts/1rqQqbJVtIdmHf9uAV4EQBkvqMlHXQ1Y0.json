  "text": " So, we will just create a new material for this which I will right click, I got some material I'm going to call this M underscore, I'm just going to call this master, let's say master for now and I'm going to hit enter and then enter again and so I want to actually hold down T this time so I'll go to T and press left click, I'm going to create four of these so T left click, T left click, T left click and T left click, I mean alternative you can just copy and paste so I could hit control C, control V if I wanted to copy and paste but because it's T and left click it's quite a straightforward command to use, I'm going to plug one into my base color, I'm going to plug one into my metallic, going to get a roughness and I will use a normal map in this instance so we're going to normal. Now you can see that we're error in red so let's just plug in some textures here so let's go back to our content browser and actually the thing that I keep just not getting used to in Unreal Engine 5, let's make use of it now, in our material we can hit control and space bar and we can open the drawer here which is a really really handy tool for those of you who used previous versions for Unreal Engine that didn't have this, you can see what kind of lifesaver it is but let's go ahead and add this white square material first so we want to go to engine content and so instead of the main content you want to go to engine content now and for whatever reason you can't see engine content you can come over to settings on the right hand side here and just make sure you show engine content so we're looking out for the engine content here and then I believe it's called white square texture so we can use either one of these I think they're both the same, yeah well let's go for the first one I think you'll be fine with either but let's just go with the first one for now so we can plug that in there we can select this texture sample and under texture we can just plug that in because we've got it selected in our previous window we'll also apply that to the roughness as well now we want to find a black texture so we'll type in black and I think it's that first one yeah let's go for the black one by one let's put that in there and let's assign that so we're just because we've got it assigned in a quick draw by pressing ctrl and spacebar we are then oh there's two more up here let's go with the first one I think that's going to be the safer one to pick so let's just hit black there that's good and then ctrl and spacebar and now let's type in T underscore normal make sure we spell that correctly and then we want this T underscore normal and then we'll go back here select the last texture sample plug that in and then we'll hit save so what we've got here is we've got a placeholder materials placeholder texture sample sorry for our material and then what we'll do in a similar way that we did the the previous material instance with the colors we can just right-click and convert this to a parameter so we'll call this albedo texture we'll right-click the next one convert to a parameter and call this metallic texture and you can imagine what the next one is going to be so right-click convert to parameter we'll call this roughness texture and then last one we'll call this one normal texture so convert to parameter normal texture and so if we save and then go to our content browser which again I'm just going to open my draw here which goes ctrl and spacebar I'm going to zero out any such bar information I'm going to go back to my materials folder on my master material I'm going to right-click create a material instance I'm just going to call this mi master maybe I'll call this mi underscore master this is where you probably want a prefix of like m underscore master underscore would underscore o1 for example so then you can have this big parent material and then you can define based on the material type but I'm just going to call this o1 for now just so we get an idea I'm going to hit enter to open it and you'll see that we now have some global texture parameters so we can actually enable all these and we can now plug in whatever textures we want into these different values and that will then create a different material based on that so really nice quick way to have this master material and to create some instances from that",
