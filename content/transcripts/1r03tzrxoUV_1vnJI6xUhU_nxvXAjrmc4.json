  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to continue to make a layered material system using the old way using material functions. So let's get started. Now that we have our moss material set up, we're going to make sure that everything's in the right order and the way that you need it. And you can see you should have exactly what I have for this particular material. So let's move on and we need to look at our wood material function. So let's double click on that and open that up. It's off screen. So let me pull that in screen here. There we go. And in here we have to do the same thing. Let's go and stop the preview. And we're going to make a material attributes. So make material attributes. We're going to go ahead and pull that string into here for now. So what we want to do is build out something a little bit more complex when it comes to the normal input so we can have control visually of how things should look. And then if you want, you can add what you need for the wood control for your object if you need for your scene. So let's go ahead and actually make a input for our tint. So let's go and create a function input. There we go. Let's go pull that up. In this function input, we want to make sure that we're set to vector three. And you'll see by default that is set in and we are good to go. I like to turn on the preview when I can. You don't necessarily need that in this version of Unreal and older versions you needed it so that it showed up to the party so you can see what you had. I'm going to keep my finger the L key and left click and do a Lerp. I'm going to pull that input function here. Let's actually give it a name. I just forgot we forgot to name it. So we're going to call this wood tint. There we go. Perfect wood tint in there. Let's go ahead and add a con some controls here for darkening in this particular case. So we want to go ahead and keep my finger the one key left click and we'll pull that right into the B channel there and we'll just set that to a one. This could be something we can fix later if you want to. But for now, we'll just keep this here as a placeholder. And we want to go ahead and bring in an alpha and that alpha is going to be the texture. So let's go ahead and put that texture in there. So let's go and keep your T key left click and let's go and call up that bark and it's an oak bark. So we'll go ahead and type in T underscore oak oak bark. There we go albedo and we're going to go ahead and plug that right into the alpha there. There we go. And then now we're going to bring this across to the base color. Fantastic. So let's go and move this up just a bit. A little bit more organized, a little bit more room. And then now we're going to head in to do some editing for the rough and we'll put in some defaults just for the spread control of how that rough is going to look. So let's go and hit the T key again. We're going to go ahead and grab in the details that same texture set. So oak. There we go. Roughness. Pull that up. Don't need to expose any parameters. I do get into that habit from general functions played by different rules. So don't have to worry about that as much. I'm going to keep my finger on the one key and we'll set this first prime to 0.5. It's going to be at the top of alert. Keep a finger the L key and we'll drag that 0.5 into the A channel there as a nice placeholder for the mix that we're doing. And we want to make sure the effect kind of turns on. So keep our finger on the one key again. And then in this constant, we'll set that to one in the details and pull that into the B channel. And finally, we're going to grab this texture just like we did above and pull this into the A, but we're not going to grab the RGB. We're going to grab we need the black and white information. It's pretty solid and strong and the red channel and we'll pull that into the alpha there. Pretty cool. Awesome so far. Now we want to go ahead and pull this right into the roughness. Right there. There we go. Awesome. So finally, we want to control a little bit of the normals here. So things look a little bit believable and you know, just give you some options here and we're going to kind of follow the same playbook but not. We're actually going to get the RGB and split them up using multiplies and appends, which you've learned in other classes. We can use a append vector to be able to split information and control it. That's pretty much what we're going to do here. So I'm going to keep my finger the T key. This is going to be my texture and then in this texture, we're going to pull up the same set of textures here to get the normal T underscore oak. There we go. Get that normal and we're going to go ahead and hit the M key for a multiply. M key for another multiply and we need we're going to need a function input to control this one. Now we don't have a function input for the roughness, but if you wanted to, you could add it kind of the same what we did here for the albedo. We just have some defaults. So but here we need to have it here like we do have it for our albedo. So we're going to actually pull that in. So let's go ahead and pull up a function input. Here we go. And we're going to set that to a scalar because we want to control a range and let's give it a name. We're going to call this the normal. Got to be able to spell that multiplier. I think that's what I called them before. Yep, there you go. And let's go ahead and the default should be fine. I always turn the preview just to force a habit and we're going to plug these in appropriately. So I'm going to grab the first little string here and pull it into the beach how to multiply. I'm going to grab the green channel in here into this multiply because now we're controlling the green when we do so. I'm going to grab the red channel and pull it into the B of this multiply and grab this input to also make sure it magnifies or changes the strength of this multiply here, which would be the red. So we're controlling the green and the red by doing this. And then we're going to create a pen vector. Let's grab those append vectors. There we go. Pull that in. It'll just say append. That's fine. And then there are unreal tell you what you're looking at if you do control, control alt. So just keep that in mind if you're not sure what you have, if it's the right one, because there are a few names that kind of cross pollinate a little bit. All right, so we're going to go ahead and pull that multiply into the eight channel of that append. I'm going to grab this multiply and put it into the B channel of the append. And I'm just going to duplicate it by doing control D used to be control W, but now control D. And I'm going to grab the blue channel so I can control the blue color information and grab that append and pull it this append here into that second append a channel there. And then finally, we're going to pull that right into the normal. There we go. I'm going to pull this back a little bit. So it makes more sense. Awesome. So now we've built out our wood material function. And if you need to go and give it a preview to see how it's looking, it's looking pretty good. All right. So in this video, we're going to go ahead and start bringing these all together and you're going to see a layered effect, which we created. Thanks again.",
