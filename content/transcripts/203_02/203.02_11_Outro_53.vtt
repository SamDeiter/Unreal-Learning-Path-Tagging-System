Let's go ahead and recap what we talked about.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.380
So for the class, we went over exposure control and tools.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.380
In that we talked about a lumen focus.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.360
We looked at engine scalability and a few things with materials and CVars.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.820
Next we look at environment light baking.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.080
We looked at initial setup in which we can get things rolling.

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.140
We worked working with lights and detail and also adding some baking.
