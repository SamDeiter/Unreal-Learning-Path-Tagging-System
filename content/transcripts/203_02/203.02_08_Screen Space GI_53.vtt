00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at screen space global illumination and how

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
that works.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.220
So let's get started.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.360
So using screen space global illumination, keep in mind that it is beta.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240
It's been there for a bit.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.240
It allows us to have a really quick on screen global illumination solution.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.600
Now if you are using it with baked lighting, because you can use it outside of baked lighting,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.440
and we go into that in other classes, but in this particular case, we'll talk a little

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
bit more focused on the baked lighting side.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.360
You want to make sure when you are using it with baked lighting that you have your baked

11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.920
lighting already set in because it is complementary.

12
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.640
It doesn't replace it, but it is complementary in that particular scenario.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.560
It can also be turned on in your post process volume, which I'll show you in just a second.

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.520
In your indirect lighting, strength can also be controlled too.

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.760
So let me show you what I mean.

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.660
So in Unreal, we already have things pre-baked out here, and we're using screen space global

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.520
illumination.

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
And again, what I mean by you being able to turn this on in two different places, if we

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.460
go to our edit project settings and we go back under rendering, when I showed you previously

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.280
to edit things for baking or for lumen.

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280
Let's go there.

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
We went too far.

23
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.520
Let's go back up.

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.760
So we go down here.

25
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.600
You can see we're in screen space global illumination under dynamic global illumination method.

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.560
And we're using shadow maps because this is more of the baked scenario.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.320
And again, this is the old school way to do things with Unreal.

28
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.520
And you can use screen space global illumination when it comes to lumen.

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.200
You can mix things up.

30
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.480
Let's actually talk about that post process ability to mix things up here.

31
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.520
So I'm going to go and type in post process volume.

32
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.200
Let's go and call that up.

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.720
And we can scroll down and see what our global illumination method is.

34
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.120
Now in our project settings, we know they're already set, but we can override things here.

35
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.600
So I can set this to screen space global illumination.

36
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.140
You saw a momentary error there because Unreal's all, there's no way you can do this for you

37
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.240
because we don't have the settings for lumen.

38
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.840
But now we're in screen space here.

39
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.040
In screen space, we can actually control how things or the strength of things are when

40
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.480
it comes to global illumination.

41
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.200
And what I mean by that is we can actually adjust that indirect lighting.

42
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.920
Let me show you how that works.

43
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.920
You'll see under advanced, we can click on this and we can control indirect lighting

44
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920
intensity.

45
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920
See that?

46
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.200
So we're actually controlling how that light is being bounced around and the strength

47
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.920
of it in our environment.

48
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.600
We can also adjust a color if we need a particular color.

49
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.640
This is really great to be able to have this option in here.

50
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640
Now this is in a baked scenario.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.400
You can also use this in lumen as well as with ray tracing.

52
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.280
But when you do that, you have to make sure you know exactly where your settings are at.

53
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.760
So case in point, if I'm using screen space global illumination in my GI, am I using it

54
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.760
in my reflections?

55
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.120
Well, if we had it to ray trace, we could use ray trace reflections and still use screen

56
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.200
space global illumination.

57
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.280
We could use lumen global illumination, and I'm not sure why you would, but you could

58
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.680
use screen space reflections.

59
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.000
All these things are adaptable, but you have to remember where things are at.

60
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.880
So I like to keep things either lumen or not lumen.

61
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.120
But if I'm in ray tracing, maybe something might be expensive, I can easily switch my

62
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.360
global illumination instead of ray tracing GI, go to screen space.

63
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.040
You can see ray tracing GI down below.

64
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.360
And it does say deprecated, but don't let that fool you.

65
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.440
In our next class, we talk about ray tracing.

66
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.720
In our next advanced classes, I should say, we talk about it.

67
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.360
We talk about the ins and outs of this.

68
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.760
Now this is going to be around for a bit, but some of these things are actually already

69
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.840
incorporated with lumen, hence the name deprecated.

70
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.840
So it's still going to be around, so don't think that it's going to disappear just yet.

71
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.760
So the nice thing about using this is you can actually see these items glowing on screen.

72
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.100
Now the disadvantage you run into is when using screen space, as you turn your camera,

73
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.320
you can lose some of the stuff that it may be affected.

74
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.120
Now I'm fooling the eye here.

75
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.320
I'm actually using a rec light to make it look like there's a little bit more glowing

76
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.520
going on, but that anything like a glowing material, such as this little green area,

77
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.280
there can be some clipping occurring.

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.640
Today, Unreal's working like a champ and no clippings happening, but if I turned my camera

79
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.320
past a certain point, I would actually get some clipping and that would disappear.

80
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.240
So just be aware of that if you have glowing objects and you want them to, say, relate

81
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.400
to other objects, and we can cheat a little bit here.

82
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.840
And I'll get a simple piece of geometry in here.

83
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.880
Pull it up to that green area.

84
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.040
Maybe we can see that effect.

85
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.240
We'll get really close to see if that green light.

86
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.920
There may be too many lights in here for this to actually give off any reasonable reaction.

87
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.600
You would see things clipping go away as I turn my camera here.

88
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.120
You can see a little bit of that there.

89
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.480
See that geometry that has bounced light disappear here off the orb right around this part on

90
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.840
the very rim of the geometry.

91
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.280
You'll actually see that disappear.

92
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280
And that's what I mean.

93
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.060
Some of those, as you turn your camera, will go away.

94
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.940
You would have to use over scan if you're using ICV effects.

95
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.660
If you were to use this effect, you would have to do it within your NDC properties,

96
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.180
your camera properties, to be able to compensate for that.

97
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.180
So just keep those things in mind.

98
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.300
Note, the effect can also be used for interiors and interiors and the objects can be animated,

99
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.500
but do be careful of how that clipping happens.

100
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.500
So just be aware of it.

101
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.300
It can be tricky.

102
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.860
You'll also see we have reflection capture resolution.

103
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.140
We also have reflection screen space.

104
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.500
You can actually use also screen space for your reflections, but it's not as accurate.

105
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.060
So you may want to mix and match if you can.

106
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.060
Just be aware of that.

107
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.620
There can be some banding going on, obscure type of looks and feels for things.

108
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.160
So again, limitations.

109
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.600
Screen space is based on your camera and 3D space, like we mentioned.

110
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.160
You'll notice clipping, which I demonstrated.

111
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.840
Also when you're using it, you need to have some sort of baked data in place if you're

112
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.120
using it with baked data.

113
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.280
It was created to complement baking in place and not replace it.

114
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.280
You can use it with ray tracing if you wish, and you can use it.

115
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.760
And again, I wouldn't really recommend it, but you could if you wanted to, saying Lumen

116
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.880
is giving you too much noise.

117
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.600
You can turn off Lumen GI and switch the screen space with some Lumen reflectivity in some

118
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
areas.

119
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600
You can do that.

120
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.720
Just be aware of how things are placed in the scene, because the more you stack things

121
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.020
up, the more you mix and match.

122
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.700
There could be other conditions and situations happening with your material, with your lighting,

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.480
with your reflectivity.

124
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.820
Just make sure you're managing how things go and understanding the limitations for all

125
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.020
of these.

126
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.580
That's about it with this course.

127
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.580
Here's a link to get you deeper into the subject and understand the material better.

128
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.660
In the next course, we're going to take a look at GPU lightmass and we'll do a quick

129
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.900
overview on how that works.

130
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.420
Thanks again.
