00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at a few more things with Lumen, and then

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.760
we're going to go and jump in and look at exposure control when it comes to setting

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.360
up your scene.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.800
So let's get started.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.160
So we built our scene out and we brought in a post-process volume controlling some of

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.920
the quality in here as we need.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.800
Now again, a review of some of that, we can actually, if your scene supports it, and remember

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.640
some of these are GPU expensive and if you increase them, you need to keep in mind what

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.480
your GPU can handle.

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.040
So I can increase my lighting quality as well as my scene detail if I wish.

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040
Now my system is a bit stronger than some others and I can go in here and even increase

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.120
my final gather if I need to.

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.000
Now as we do this, you can remove some of the noise, but you have to keep in mind some

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.880
of your materials, which was mentioned in other classes before, where you can actually

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.080
adjust the material roughness.

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.840
And when you adjust the material roughness, you're able to remove some of the noise.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
Now some of the noise may still persist so that you can still use some C-Vars to clean

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
that up.

19
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.040
But keep in mind that Lumen is still evolving as it grows and gets stronger, faster and

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
better.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.840
You will need to be very deterministic about your shots, your materials and your angles.

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.080
And you'll notice here in this particular shot, there's a little bit, just a little

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.140
bit of noise over here on these rough areas compared to over here where it's a little

24
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.040
bit higher, where there's a lot more bouncing and refracted areas.

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.860
We also want to go in here and go to our project settings.

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.040
In my project settings, I want to go in here and look at my static light.

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.920
The reason why I want to do this and make sure that static light options are off is

28
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.480
I want to make sure that they're not pulling anything unnecessary in my scene.

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.920
So I'm going to turn off my allow static lighting.

30
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.600
I'm also going to make sure that I turn off my ambient occlusion static fraction.

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.080
And you'll see mine's already off.

32
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.940
Now this will require a restart.

33
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.820
So let me go ahead and restart this and we'll go back into our scene.

34
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.940
Now you'll notice if we float over that tick box that we turned off, Unreal will give

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.320
you a breakdown saying you should really turn this off.

36
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.960
That way it allows the bent normals and the luminal global illumination to actually calculate

37
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.900
those correctly.

38
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.340
And it really just is not needed.

39
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.780
And you're saving some overhead there.

40
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.300
So you want to make sure you turn that off.

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.780
Now that was covered in the first class, but I just wanted to remind everyone about that.

42
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.060
So let me go ahead and close these two windows.

43
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.300
So we have our scene in here and we're looking pretty good, but we want to maybe try to get

44
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.980
it so that our exposure is really at a level that makes sense.

45
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.420
So from ground up, you can say, let me close this window too.

46
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.180
Don't need it at this time.

47
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.620
So what we want to do is go into our content drawer.

48
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.260
I'm going to click on engine and I'm going to type in calibrator.

49
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.980
I'm going to pull in my SM color calibrator.

50
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.620
I'll pull this into my scene and I'll drag this one outside for a moment.

51
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.900
This is going to give us the best possible results for our exposure and allow us to be

52
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.340
able to pull in what we need.

53
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.740
Now, before we do that, I do want to mention scalability.

54
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.780
This is very important when working with Unreal to determine what your computer can handle.

55
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.820
Now in older settings, it was found up at the top and older versions of Unreal, but

56
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.740
you can now find underneath your settings here, scalability, engine settings.

57
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.900
Everything I have is set to epic, but if I wanted to, I can also set things to cinematic.

58
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.580
My computer can handle that.

59
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.580
But you can also have auto here.

60
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.820
Now when you set auto, Unreal will determine based on your computer, the best settings

61
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.420
that are needed and can accommodate what you have under the hood.

62
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.700
Now let's go back to the slides.

63
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.300
I'm going to take a look at a few points I want to make clear and some things you have

64
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.740
to adjust before we go forward.

65
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.220
So in our project settings, there's a few things we need to make sure that we turn off.

66
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.220
One of them is bloom.

67
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.460
We want to make sure that bloom is turned off.

68
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
And AO.

69
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.460
Now you can turn them on.

70
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
I usually turn them on to turn them off or make them zero.

71
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.140
And that way, if I need to go back to them and turn them back on, I can easily do so.

72
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.980
Also turn off auto exposure that's in the project settings.

73
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.500
Any vignetting that you have in your post-process volume.

74
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.680
And turn off your extended default luminance range.

75
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.180
That will require a restart.

76
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.240
So just keep that in mind.

77
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.120
Some people may want to keep this on so that you still have a little bit of a auto calculation

78
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.520
for your distance and your luminance.

79
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.160
I prefer to actually turn that off.

80
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.280
But it's really up to you as you decide to dive into these deeper.

81
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.920
Let's go ahead and take a look at some of these things in Unreal and mess with these

82
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.920
settings.

83
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.280
Okay, so let's go ahead and go into the project settings and change some of those things.

84
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.280
One, let's go and type in bloom.

85
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.080
So you can see I have bloom turned off.

86
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.400
And you want to have this one turned off initially.

87
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.740
Next we want to go in here and type in AO.

88
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.280
So we want to make sure that our, or you can just type in ambient inclusion.

89
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.500
Maybe a little bit easier so you don't get a thousand things.

90
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.200
Turn off your default ambient occlusion as well as the baked one.

91
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.480
You don't need that.

92
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.620
And you want to keep things pretty pure, especially if you are baking.

93
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.620
You want to make it so you're starting off from scratch.

94
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.300
You can go in here and change a few things later on as you go.

95
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.780
Next we want to also go in here and change our extended.

96
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.380
Make sure we spell that correctly.

97
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.380
We need default luminance range in the auto exposure settings.

98
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.540
We want to make sure you turn that off.

99
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.820
We also want to make sure auto exposure isn't on.

100
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.820
I almost forgot about that one.

101
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.140
So auto exposure, you want to turn that off so you're in control.

102
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.740
And I'll show you how you can actually reactivate that.

103
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.860
But within the post process volume, which is actually pretty nice.

104
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.980
Also, if you did inherit something from the marketplace, you want to go into your post

105
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.220
process volume.

106
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.620
And in here, you want to go in here and you want to look for vignetting because someone

107
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.140
may have turned it on and you may not even know.

108
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.620
And you can see in this case, we have it on.

109
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.260
We can turn that off.

110
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.620
We don't want to have that on.

111
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.260
That makes it so you have a pure scene.

112
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.020
You know exactly what it is you're getting exposure wise.

113
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.700
And it's pretty beneficial.

114
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.860
So now we want to go ahead and take a look at our exposure and see the amount and judge

115
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:35.220
exactly what we have with those settings, everything else in place.

116
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.860
Now that we're in unreal, I'm going to go and move over to the outside where our calibrator

117
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.860
is at where we left it.

118
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.020
And I'm going to look at the third gray square from the right side here.

119
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.500
And we're going to use a thing called a pixel inspector.

120
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:59.020
This pixel inspector will allow us to go in here and to be able to judge exactly what

121
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.340
it is on our color exposure.

122
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.040
Pretty much looking at our exposure, I should say, and looking at the color in that pixel,

123
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.640
the luminance of it, I should say.

124
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.240
And it's going to tell us exactly where we stand with things.

125
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.600
Now you'll see it here right where it says debug.

126
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.200
You'll go down to pixel inspector.

127
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200
Want to click on pixel inspector.

128
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
Let me drag it over.

129
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:33.000
We're going to turn on the start pixel inspector and we see there is a luminance here that

130
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.200
we want to focus on.

131
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.640
And it says luminance before tone map.

132
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.640
I'm going to float over and it's going to give me what that is for that particular pixel.

133
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.640
And we can see that it's 7.5.

134
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.640
But that's not exactly what we need.

135
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:59.640
If we go back to the notes here, you'll see that we're looking for a 0.18 or 18% gray.

136
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.640
This is going to be coming back as a 50% in our gray sRGB.

137
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.640
This really does depend on the scene, but we can actually adjust things and correct

138
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.640
things to what we need.

139
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.640
Let's go back into Unreal and do that.

140
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.640
With the pixel inspector active, we can now use it so that we can analyze that scene again.

141
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640
So let's go and do that.

142
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640
Go to debug again.

143
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.640
I'm going to go to our pixel inspector.

144
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
And again, you click on the magnifying glass.

145
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.640
We can now inspect where our luminance is at.

146
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.640
Now we can see that our luminance is pretty high.

147
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.640
So to be able to fix that, we're going to go in here and adjust our strength of our light.

148
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.640
And we're going to lower this to like a 4.5.

149
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.640
You can even keep it at 5 if you want to.

150
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.640
But we can now check with the pixel inspector.

151
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.640
And we're pretty close with our luminance before tone map.

152
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.640
So we can actually get this just to 4 and see what we get.

153
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.640
And then do that again.

154
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.640
Pretty close, but not quite there.

155
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.640
And we'll get that intensity adjusted.

156
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.640
So we'll do a 3.5.

157
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640
There we go.

158
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.640
3.5 it is.

159
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.640
Now with that set up, I can now go in here and control my exposure.

160
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:29.640
So I've adjusted the light here and I can go in here and now in my scene, go to my post

161
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.640
process volume and turn on a few things.

162
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.640
Now if we look at exposure up close, you'll notice we do have a default bloom intensity

163
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.640
and threshold.

164
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.640
So I can turn these off if I want to.

165
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.640
It's up to you how you do this.

166
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.640
Realize when you do turn on bloom and crank that up, it could actually make things a bit

167
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640
blown out.

168
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.640
We'll close mobile because we're not in mobile.

169
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.640
We'll close bloom for now.

170
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.640
And we're going to mainly focus here.

171
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.640
Now there's several different ways that you can choose your exposure.

172
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640
There's an auto exposure, which I prefer, because then I can lock it down within a range.

173
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.640
Let me show you what I'm talking about, particularly the minimum brightness and maximum brightness.

174
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.640
So if I do adjust that and turn on auto exposure, I can keep my minimum and my maximum within

175
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.640
a particular range and it will help adjust according to my settings and what I have in

176
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640
place.

177
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.640
Now, I, a lot of the times, will set this simply to one because then everything works

178
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.640
as a simple EV slider and I can choose whether I want it dark or I want it bright right there

179
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640
within my scene.

180
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.640
And I'm in full control of everything and I know exactly where my exposure lies and

181
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.640
how I've set it.

182
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.640
You can also choose to do auto exposure basic and a few things will be grayed out as you

183
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.640
go and change between these, as well as you can also do manual, which is pretty straightforward.

184
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.640
We're just mainly messing with this again, like an EV breakdown, but you'll notice some

185
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.640
of these are grayed out and no longer such as the minimum brightness and maximum brightness

186
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.640
are no longer adjustable when you're in manual.

187
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640
But again, I like auto exposure.

188
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.640
Call me an old school game head for me.

189
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.640
That helps me be able to adjust this.

190
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.640
And if I did want to create a minimum and maximum to get that auto to be able to control

191
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.640
within a range, I have that choice.

192
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640
It's really up to you how you want to do it.

193
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.640
And we can set these to default and you can see the auto exposure kind of adjusting itself

194
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640
as I go from one room to the next.

195
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.640
I look in different areas.

196
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.640
You will notice too, off to the right here, we have a thing called a exposure compensation

197
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640
curve.

198
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.640
You can load these and build the curves yourself.

199
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.640
There are some default ones that come in here.

200
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.640
If I double click on this, this curve now is able to be adjusted and will affect my scene.

201
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.640
Now, some of it might be very minimal when you move these around, but it's up to you

202
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.640
how you adjust it and how you move things and how you edit things accordingly.

203
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.640
If I grab the whole line here and move it up and down.

204
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.640
You'll see things slightly change.

205
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.640
You got a little brighter and I'll move this down.

206
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640
You'll see it get darker.

207
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.640
So it does have an influence.

208
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.640
It just may seem a little bit weak in here.

209
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.640
It's up to you how you adjust that curve.

210
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.640
I'm going to turn the curve off.

211
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640
We don't need it.

212
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.640
And they can definitely see the dramatic change.

213
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640
There is a exposure meter mask.

214
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640
You could also load if you wanted to.

215
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.640
But all these things are at your fingertips to be able to control your exposure.

216
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.640
There are a few materials to keep in mind when working with Unreal 2.

217
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.640
So this particular one has a very distinct material in here for our glass.

218
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.640
There's a frosted glass effect in here.

219
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.640
You will see the noise because lumen and some materials may not play necessarily nicely.

220
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.640
It may give you a bit higher noise.

221
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640
So keep that in mind.

222
00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.640
And this particular material, if you slide over, is a spiral blur texture, scene texture.

223
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.640
So you can experiment with some of these materials.

224
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.640
Some of them I'm not really sure some that will work and not work.

225
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640
You have to.

226
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640
It's always a case by case.

227
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.640
And also lumen is constantly evolving, getting better and stronger.

228
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.640
But you can definitely see the noise coming through on this blurred effect.

229
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.640
In this particular case, you may want to just use an alpha mask that is a bit more 50 50 gray.

230
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.640
And per using it within the material, because we definitely are getting a bit of noise there.

231
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.640
Here is a list of CVARS that you can use to be able to run and experiment with your scene.

232
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
And they are available to you.

233
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.640
But let me show you some quick tips and tricks when working with these CVARS in Unreal.

234
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.640
A lot of people aren't aware in Unreal you have the ability to actually call upon the CVARS at any time,

235
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.640
because they do disappear if you just work in your output log down below.

236
00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:01.640
But you can use a tool that we have set up for you that allows us to be able to go in here.

237
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.640
And let me go ahead and find this guy.

238
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.640
This is just an added added bonus that I'm adding to this course.

239
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640
We got to turn him on.

240
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.640
So if I go to plugins here.

241
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.640
We turn on console.

242
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.640
You'll see there's a thing called a console variable editor.

243
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.640
Let me turn mine on and give it a restart.

244
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.640
And you can actually see kind of how cool it is.

245
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:37.640
Now that I've restarted, I'm going to go in here under windows and pull up a thing called console variables.

246
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.640
This console variables allows me to add any console variable that I have in my commands.

247
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.640
Say I've worked on a few and I've added a few.

248
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.640
I can place them in the console variables.

249
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.640
Worked on a few and I've added a few.

250
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:57.640
I can place them here and I can even save those presets that I already have in place and call upon them whenever I need them.

251
00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.640
It's really nice.

252
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:06.640
So you don't have to worry about punching stuff into the command line here and seeing it disappear or no longer working as an on when you close in real.

253
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.640
You can actually load it through your console variables.

254
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.640
Very handy.

255
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.640
And also if you get stuck and you're like, I'm not sure which Lumen ones I have.

256
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.640
I have maybe I don't have Sean's a magical PDF.

257
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.640
You can go into your console variable search table here that is built under help here.

258
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.640
If you go down just about four lines here, you'll see console variables.

259
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:35.640
Click on that and you're going to get quickly navigated to an area where you can look up that console variable that you need.

260
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640
Pretty nice.

261
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.640
And I can simply just type in Lumen.

262
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.640
So everything that has to do with Lumen is now going to come up into my search.

263
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.640
And it gives you a description for each item to which is really helpful.

264
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.640
Well, that's it for this class.

265
00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:02.640
Here's some more information that you can click on to be able to actually dive a bit more into auto exposure and other exposure properties when working with unreal.

266
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:10.640
In the next section, we're going to take a look at the old school way to bake your lights in using the bake lighting system in unreal.

267
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.640
You.
