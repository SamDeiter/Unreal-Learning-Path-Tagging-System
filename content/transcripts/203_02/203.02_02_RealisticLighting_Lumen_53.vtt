00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi everyone. In this lesson, we're going to take a look at the outline for Lightning Cinematic Fundamentals.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
From there, we're going to go ahead and jump into Unreal and look a bit at the slides when it comes to setting up a Lumen scene and controlling your exposure.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's get started.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So first up, we're going to take a look at Exposure Control and Tools.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
From there, we'll look at setting up a simple scene in Lumen. We'll look at engine scalability, Lumen material limitations, and Lumen CVars.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Next, we'll look at environment light baked lighting, which is our first way to work with lighting, which we first established before Lumen.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll look at the initial setup as an option, working with lights in detail and adding AO baking.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Next, we'll look at light maps and light mass under that same topic of baked lighting.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We'll look at the best settings for light mass and light mass importance volume, light map UVs, and solver quality.

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Next, we'll look at reflections underneath baking also, and when to use them, reflection types, scenarios, building quality, and tips.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Reflections can also be used for ray tracing, so this can actually help a bit.

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
View modes and visualizers. We'll next look at looking at volumetric light maps, light mass tips, screen space, global illumination, using it, and some of its limitations.

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We'll next look at GPU light mass, the overview, what it is, and setting it up.

14
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And finally, we'll look at an exercise where we will be lighting a character.

15
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So let's go ahead and get started.

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So let's go ahead and take a look at realistic lighting and exposure control and tools.

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what we'll do first is I'll walk you through a Lumen focus on setting things up just as a reminder of some of the things we covered in our first class.

18
00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So here are some of the steps listed in my lecture, some of the things you can consider putting on, and it's very important to make sure that these are on when working with Unreal.

19
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm specifically going to talk about looking at your Lumen details for lighting mode and software ray tracing mode, which we'll point out in just a second.

20
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's go and jump into Unreal and I'll point some of these details out so you can keep them in mind.

21
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Here I have a cafe scene, and if you want to open it up, it is actually found underneath if we go to our Lumen folder here for the class, which is labeled for our class here.

22
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
From here, you'll see that I have a Lumen indoor sample scene, and that's pretty much what we have here.

23
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So in my scene, one of the things you want to keep in mind is how we're going to set this up initially, which we'll do in just a second.

24
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But I want to point out some things first up that you need to do when working with Lumen.

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So say we're getting ready to look at a Lumen scene.

26
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let's go to our project settings here and pull these across here.

27
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Sorry, it was a bit off screen.

28
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We're going to go underneath rendering.

29
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In rendering, we want to make sure that we're working with Lumen.

30
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We also want to make sure that we are using hardware ray tracing when available.

31
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And once you have that set in, you also want to make sure you're supporting hardware ray tracing.

32
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You'll see one on first, and then the other will be available.

33
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
With that, you also, if you're grabbing stuff from the marketplace, make sure you have virtual shadow maps on, as well as mesh distance fields.

34
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, these things won't be on by default if you're grabbing stuff from the marketplace, but it's very important to consider these things.

35
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And you can look at mesh distance field by simply typing in mesh distance field, and you'll see generate mesh distance field.

36
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And you want to have that with Unreal.

37
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So again, some of these things will be on by default, but it's actually also good to check to make sure if you grab something from the marketplace that some of these things aren't turned off

38
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and maybe catering to the old baking method.

39
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We have ray tracing lit mode. You'll see it says surface catch, but you can also set this to a higher set by default and hit lighting for reflections.

40
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This can also be set in the post process volume.

41
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You'll also see under safe software ray tracing mode, it says detailed tracing or global tracing.

42
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Of course, one is more expensive, such as detailed tracing versus global tracing.

43
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This just depends on your system and whether you can handle that.

44
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So keep things in mind and be very deterministic.

45
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
One of the things or at least the two things you do need to also consider on my list is shader model six.

46
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Shader model six should be on when working with Unreal.

47
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I like to turn both of these on. I may not need this Vulkan one, but just in case I bring in a shader that may need that support, I make sure that I put these in here.

48
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Also, you want to make sure that virtual text screen is on. This will help with some of the visualizers.

49
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So in this case, we don't really need it because we're not going to get into the visualizers that we covered in the first class.

50
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But you do want to be able to turn that on when you can.

51
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I already have my on, so we're in luck there.

52
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But if you don't have it on, do turn it on. If you want to check Lumen, you want to check your your your shadow maps.

53
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I shouldn't say shadow maps, your virtual shadow maps, and you want to make sure that those are in the right direction.

54
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We already covered some of that in the first class.

55
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But in here, you can also double check just in case, again, if you're pulling things in from a marketplace or you're inheriting a scene that you think may not have that on.

56
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But those are actually good support for your visualizers.

57
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Let me close this for a second and let's go ahead and go to a scene that is a starting point for us.

58
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So there's our Lumen indoor start. Let's go and click on that.

59
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So this one just has a few things in here, maybe a few lights.

60
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Let's go and get some of the things in this scene and make sure we're really bare bones.

61
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So let's go ahead and take a look at our lights and we're going to turn off our sky atmosphere.

62
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Get rid of that volume, which a cloud gone. Good.

63
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Let's see if there's any other lights that we need.

64
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
There are some glowing items in our scene and there's also a post process volume.

65
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Let's get rid of that post process volume for a moment.

66
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And then we can track down if there's any other lights in here.

67
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And we should be good to go.

68
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Double check the assets and we should be OK.

69
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Now, the only lights we're getting is from Lumen because these items here, each one has a glowing material.

70
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Our first class talked about this, how you can actually set up a glowing material in your scene.

71
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So that is actually giving us some light.

72
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Now, the problems you can run into if this item or object that's glowing is very small,

73
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
you can get a lot more noise and there might be some issues.

74
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.000
For now, we can leave this as is and let's actually open up our environment light mixer.

75
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
There it is off screen. I was just double checking to make sure it's open.

76
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It looks like it already was.

77
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
We want to first create our sky light.

78
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Then we want to create our atmospheric light.

79
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Again, you're going to get this error because some of these lights do have dependencies to be able to get some of these to work together with it,

80
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to give that believability that you need. And that's why that first one comes up.

81
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It needs at least the sky atmosphere to be working correctly.

82
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We're going to create an atmospheric light.

83
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I'm going to create a sky atmosphere and then I'm going to create a volume at your cloud.

84
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And eventually we'll do a height fog.

85
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Now we have these all set up in place.

86
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now you'll notice our cafe doesn't seem to have anything to write home about.

87
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's kind of standard stuff.

88
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And there's an HDR backdrop out here.

89
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And you can use HDR backdrops. It's up to you.

90
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There's no requirement for your scene.

91
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's really how you need it for what you're doing because we're inside a cafe so we can maybe give a little suspension of disbelief.

92
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But just be aware that if you go outside or you're going to be looking at these and you do want to sell the idea and this pretty much looks this is pretty generic.

93
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So just keep that in mind.

94
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Let's go and grab our directional light.

95
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
With our directional light now, let's go and move this over.

96
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I'm going to move it where you can see where it's pointing.

97
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We can see it's in the opposite direction of our cafe.

98
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So let's rotate that so it's shining in our environment.

99
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We can bump that out if we bump that up if we want to.

100
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Let's check our skylight and always especially if you're grabbing stuff from the marketplace, make sure that real time capture is on.

101
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
If you turn that off, you're not going to get the quality that you need when it comes to your environment.

102
00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Specifically when you're in a little bit different scenario here, such as maybe you have low light and it's coming in into your environment, that gives you some extra bouncing going on.

103
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We do want to make sure that your lights are movable.

104
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Very important to do so.

105
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Because that movable, you'll see a skylight directional, both movable, are going to work with lumen.

106
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So these are all just some reminders when it comes to working with lumen.

107
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Next, we want to go in here and let's increase our light just a bit.

108
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We'll make this probably about a 20.

109
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Like it's kind of a foggy day.

110
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now our fog is going to influence this a bit too.

111
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So if your fog is a lot more in your scene and magnified, we get into this in atmospheric lighting, but that can also influence how things are going to be viewed.

112
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Because like in the real world, that light's going to bounce around those water particles.

113
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We can also soften our shadows if we're getting some very edgy areas here, such as right over here on the desk.

114
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And if we move away, you'll see that get a little bit more edgier here.

115
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
In our first class, we talked about using CVars to maybe control some of that shadow quality.

116
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But what we can do with this directional light selected, we can go to the source angle and maybe increase that just a little bit there to soften that up if we get any hard edges.

117
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And oh, that looks much better.

118
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So that's helpful for our scene.

119
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You may at time get some noise.

120
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Now there are some CVars to solve this, but like we talked about in the first class, you can also visit the material.

121
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And when you visit the material, you can control just how strong some of the roughness will be.

122
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And when you lower roughness and get things a little more shiny, you can see some of the noise dissipate.

123
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Now this is a something you have to dial down or dial up or revisit the texture to be able to get that going.

124
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
But this is all up to you how this works.

125
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now there will be always a little bit of noise with Lumen because it is evolving.

126
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So just keep those things in mind.

127
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Control your roughness and how things are working and you can be the master of your own environment.

128
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Now we want to bring in a post process volume.

129
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This is really important because it's our quality control.

130
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So let's go ahead and do that.

131
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Now there's a couple of ways to do that.

132
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
You can type in volumes here.

133
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You can look for them or you can just simply go in here under volumes.

134
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And find it.

135
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You can also search at the top of this by just typing in volumes.

136
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And we'll do post process.

137
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I should do be more specific in your search.

138
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Grab that post process volume is now in our scene.

139
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And if you're wondering what just happened, I accidentally hit space bar, which shows you like everything.

140
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's the hot key for the place actors.

141
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Learn something new every day, even on accident.

142
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So I'm going to go and move this over here.

143
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
My post process volume needs to be set to infinite extend unbound.

144
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So let's go and do that.

145
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So when you do set this, scroll a little too far, you can have it so it will control everything.

146
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You can also build a box around an area if you needed.

147
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But Lumen is pretty efficient.

148
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It doesn't necessarily have to be locked down like when you're working with ray tracing.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Ray tracing, you really do want a specific area because it's a bit more expensive.

150
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We're just borrowing some of that technology from ray tracing and getting some of those light information bouncing around those photons back to the camera.

151
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So but it is work.

152
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
It works a lot smoother and a lot more trimmer than when you if you would work with ray tracing.

153
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So we want to make sure that Lumen is on.

154
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Now we do have it in the project defaults.

155
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But again, you want to turn it on under your global illumination and you want to turn it on under your reflections.

156
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Let's turn these on for now or revisit some of these quality control settings later.

157
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Just as a quick review.

158
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We also want to go to global illumination Lumen here for lighting quality, scene detail.

159
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
All these things can be bumped up to help a few things going in the right direction.

160
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And I'll give you some CVARS to help with a little bit with cleanup and show you the console tool that we have, which is pretty great.

161
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
All right.

162
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So that's it with this video.

163
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What we're going to do now is take another look at the next video at the post process volume here.

164
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We're going to edit exposure as well as we're going to look at a few Lumen settings that we can do to get things in the right direction.

165
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Thanks again.

166
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Thanks for watching.
