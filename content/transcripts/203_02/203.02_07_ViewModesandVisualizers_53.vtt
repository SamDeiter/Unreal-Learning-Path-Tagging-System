00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at view modes and visualizers.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.580
So let's get started.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.340
One of them you can look at underneath optimization view modes.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.660
You'll find that underneath our show.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.920
And in there you'll see light complexity.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.860
Light complexity will let us know if our lights are movable, stationary, or static and cover

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.220
them associated to their complexity.

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.060
Overlapping movable lights are the most expensive to work with.

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.760
You can resize the radius will help when it comes to stationary lights and them overlapping

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.500
each other because you can only do four overlapping at a time when it comes to baking.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.300
Static lights are basically free.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.560
They're really cheap to work with.

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.240
And so you can put as many as necessary.

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.920
But also keep in mind your geometry and how long things are going to take to bake.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.320
Let's go and take a look at that up close and unreal.

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.400
And I'll bring up a few points that are also known in lumen.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.920
So in our scene here, we can quickly check here what it looks like for a light complexity.

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.680
So I'm going to go under lit here.

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160
And we're going to go down, not show.

20
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.000
If I said show, please excuse me.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.560
We want to do lit.

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.440
So under lit, we want to go in here and we want to take a look at our optimization view

23
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.440
modes.

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.080
And there you'll see light complexity.

25
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.160
This shows us where the complexity of our light is at.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.880
And we see one light here, which is stationary, has quite a few areas here that it's taken

27
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.640
into account that are kind of expensive.

28
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.240
Now some of the geometry is coming in black because it's using a level instance to be

29
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.640
able to build it.

30
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.560
But you can see these lights.

31
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.680
Here's another one here, also stationary, how they affect each other as I move them

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
around.

33
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.280
These stationaries show me where the overlap is happening with another stationary light,

34
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.220
case in point, this rec light.

35
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.600
So if I have more than four overlapping, and I'll demonstrate over here in this green area.

36
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.200
If I go to say my point light, I'm pulling one and I'll pull in two and I pull in three.

37
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.960
And then if I pull in a fourth one, you'll see that one of them has an X going on.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.800
not really doing and pulling the weight like he's supposed to.

39
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.440
He's not quite working like he should as a stationary light.

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.480
He's more moved into movable just for this to be more manageable because these four overlapping

41
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.000
plus we have a directional light in place.

42
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900
So we've kind of hit our limit.

43
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.000
So these three are being counted plus our directional light.

44
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.440
So what we can do to remedy that is one, if again, this is a baking scenario, I can lower

45
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.800
the the attenuation or I can move it out of an area of influence.

46
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.000
And when you do, you'll actually see the X go away.

47
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.520
This guy's going to stick around for a bit because we have quite a bit of lights in here,

48
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.320
two directional lights, several wrecks, as well as as well as a few others in here.

49
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.020
So that's something to consider.

50
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.080
But this will tell you the complexity of it all.

51
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.640
Another mode we have is called light map density.

52
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.520
Let's take a look at that up close and some things to keep in mind when working with this.

53
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.400
So let me go ahead and remove these lights that we just created.

54
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400
Don't need them.

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.320
And you'll see the colors change as I get rid of them.

56
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.520
Red is very high.

57
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
White is really high.

58
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.600
And green, as you can tell, is pretty light on the importance or complexity scale.

59
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.240
So let's go from optimization view modes here.

60
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.480
And we're going to go to our light map density.

61
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.340
Now the light map density shows me how my settings are set for each one of these pieces

62
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.840
of geometry.

63
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.480
So let's pick something that's not merged or in a level instance, something that's a

64
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.420
little more singular.

65
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.960
So I'm going to grab this here and I'm going to scroll to the area where it shows us where

66
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.040
a light map information is at.

67
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040
Now for some reason you can't find it.

68
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.160
You'll find it right underneath the lighting and you can also do a search for light map

69
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.020
and you'll see the resolution set here.

70
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.920
You can see this is pretty low.

71
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.660
And I'm fortunate enough that I'm not getting any blobby shadows.

72
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.320
But if I was, I might want to increase this to be the same light map resolution as the

73
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320
ground.

74
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.600
We're fortunate enough because both of these, even though this is a smaller item, have the

75
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.240
same light map resolution.

76
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.000
So we're doing okay.

77
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.280
But if for some reason this is really high resolution.

78
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.880
Let's say the arch is set to like, I don't know, we have like, I shouldn't say really

79
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.480
high, but you know, you don't want to go too high with these.

80
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.600
You want to keep it reasonable.

81
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.680
So say this is like a one, a 512.

82
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.500
It's a real little, little over the top.

83
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.500
It could be one, one, 28.

84
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500
Okay.

85
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.200
But it's a five, so it's really getting close on click really good.

86
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.880
But then down on the ground, it's only, it's left at 64.

87
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.320
As soon as this object hits this area and they connect with each other, I could get

88
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.200
a blobby shadow just because it, Unreal's trying to bake that light map on there.

89
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.960
And it is trying to evaluate the difference between these two resolutions for that light

90
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960
map.

91
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.200
So just keep those things in mind if you are baking that those might be an issue.

92
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.520
In this previous scene, let's take a brief look again at some of the visualizers like

93
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720
we talked about in the first class when it comes to Lumen.

94
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.600
So we have lit here and over here we have Nanite visualization.

95
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.120
So if I do an overview, I've now converted, I right clicked in the content browser and

96
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.660
I converted all of these chairs into a Nanite object.

97
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.440
So you can view that ahead of time if you want to.

98
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.600
So we can say, hey, let's look at our Nanite visualization.

99
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.240
Now you can look at mass, the triangles, how they're clustered together, what's going on

100
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.960
with the primitives, how the calculations working, instances of those objects, the overdraw

101
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.520
that might occur if it's really high detail, material ID that's involved, UV, light map,

102
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.000
UV going on, so if you are using that, and evaluate world position offset.

103
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.640
So all these things can be listed within the overview.

104
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.600
So if I click on overview, you'll see that each one of these are in each different category.

105
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.920
This is the nice thing about overview, you can just pick and look at what you need.

106
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.400
In this case, we'll focus on the triangles.

107
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.240
So if I move around, you'll notice in some instances, and in this case, the chair is

108
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.560
really simple, but if let's go and switch the triangles here, you will see those triangles

109
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.100
flip and recalculate based on distance of the camera from the object.

110
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.400
So I'll go to triangles here for the whole thing.

111
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.360
And in this case, since these chairs are super simple, you're not going to see it as much,

112
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.040
but you would see it on high resolutions, scanned rock objects, you'll see those triangles

113
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.400
shift according to the distance we are to the object.

114
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.280
And you may see a little bit of it.

115
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.000
You see the top of the chairs kind of shift a little bit.

116
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.480
That is unreal trying to give us the best possible geometry based on distance using

117
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.240
Nanite, and Nanite is a lot more efficient because it gives you a higher resolution at

118
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.760
lower cost when it comes to your geometry.

119
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.980
So it's pretty cool to be able to see that ahead of time.

120
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.040
We also talked about in the first class, the lumen overview, which shows our geometry normals,

121
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.120
our reflection view with our hardware ray tracing involved here, lumen pink missing

122
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.440
surface catch coverage.

123
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.440
So it tells you where the errors or situations you might have or issues you may have in your

124
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.080
scene.

125
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.040
So it's actually pretty cool to be able to take a look at that really quick.

126
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.280
We also have our virtual shadow maps.

127
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280
So in here we can look at the shadow mask.

128
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.160
It shows you how things are being amassed into our scene, almost as if you're seeing

129
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.980
a real time update bake.

130
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.040
But in this case, when it comes to virtual shadow maps, they are updating on the fly

131
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.500
and they're actually not picked at all.

132
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.380
We have a clip map level.

133
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.340
You could see it sorting and popping in as we go through here and you can see that it's

134
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.920
working and doing and digesting things based on location.

135
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.240
Next we have virtual page.

136
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.640
Again, this works kind of like we saw with the Nanite.

137
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.320
So you can see it bring in what we need based on our positioning and it's trying to sort

138
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:37.600
through the data and the objects in the scene and where our light is positioned.

139
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.520
We also have the catch page, which simply is showing us how things are being catched

140
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.360
and called upon.

141
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.040
Going back to the topic of light mass and volumetric light maps.

142
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.920
Light maps, light mass in this case, creates a volumetric area in which objects can be

143
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920
calculated.

144
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.120
Again, this is a baking scenario.

145
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.360
These volumetric light maps allow objects to be calculated in the shadows to update

146
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.720
for stationary lights.

147
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.320
You can actually see this ahead of time in a baking scenario.

148
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.000
Let me show you what I mean.

149
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.040
So in Unreal, I can go in here and I can show, take a look at these components here.

150
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.920
Now at any time you can choose, I'll just briefly talk about this.

151
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.080
You can see Lumen and Nanite have some extra areas to be able to visualize things.

152
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.760
You'll see an overall visualizer.

153
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.400
We can add some more advanced stuff.

154
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400
So don't get confused.

155
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:47.400
It's easy to get lost with this, but we're going to focus mainly on showing where that

156
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.520
light mass mapping is happening.

157
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.800
So let's go back over there.

158
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.920
We're going to visualize.

159
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:07.520
I'm going to go to that light map area.

160
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.280
Volumetric light map right there.

161
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.520
And it shows you the calculations.

162
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.200
It shows you all of this.

163
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.160
These spheres are points of calculation in here in our world so that our shadows can

164
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:28.400
correctly update and work according to our geometry and our objects in our scene.

165
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400
Pretty cool.

166
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.360
Now you can increase that resolution if you want to.

167
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
I like to use it.

168
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.720
I think at default it works pretty darn well, but you'll see down here, there's a detailed

169
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.040
cell size.

170
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.840
As you increase that, you can increase some of the quality.

171
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.560
But it also is going to require a bit more brick memory.

172
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.840
You can also increase that if needed.

173
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.000
You can smooth things out if you need to.

174
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.220
Again, this is the volumetric light map.

175
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.440
This again helps with our characters and how they're working in our world and how those

176
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.320
shadows are being established.

177
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.040
Let's look at some tips and tricks real quick here for light mass.

178
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.780
So indirect quality lighting doesn't work on preview quality presets.

179
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.260
You want to make sure that if you want to get exactly what you planned and you want

180
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.340
to get the highest resolution for your bake, and you want to make sure you have a good

181
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.220
representation of what you've chosen, you really do want to make sure you have it on

182
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.220
production.

183
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.340
But you can start off low and do preview and medium and high, but eventually find yourself

184
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.300
at production if you're noticing you're missing some of the details that you know you put

185
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.980
in there, such as increasing your indirect lighting quality and so forth.

186
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.740
So ways to improve and optimize light baking, better UVs for light maps, override light

187
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.000
map resolution per object.

188
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.780
So your hero objects will have a higher resolution.

189
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.880
Optimization view modes, check things with that, show light components, and compressed

190
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.820
light maps are set to off.

191
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.400
Now briefly, I want to go back to view modes for a second because I want to point out one

192
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.040
more thing.

193
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.240
So in Unreal, underneath our optimization view modes, you'll notice there's also the

194
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.360
overlap which we talked about, but there's also shader complexity, as well as shader

195
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.360
complexity, quads and quad overdraw.

196
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.220
Quad overdraw will show us exactly where our density is at in our scene and where things

197
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.160
might be getting pulled a bit stronger with our memory.

198
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.800
In this case, this isn't too bad because we still have our spheres, which are a little

199
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.560
bit dense. And back here, we could definitely merge these.

200
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.880
We go over that in our optimization course.

201
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.040
But you'll notice we're doing pretty well.

202
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.060
As soon as we introduce trees or other items, we definitely want to look at maybe

203
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.880
switching to lumen and then also switching those larger, higher poly objects to nanite.

204
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.720
Here I have a screen showing some ways in which you can better get better results using

205
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.040
light baking, such as number of indirect lighting bounces.

206
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.640
You'll see there's five here and we'll also see the indirect lighting quality set to 20

207
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.440
and indirect lighting. So this is point zero point five.

208
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.160
And you get some really nice stuff going on here.

209
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.920
Now, the more you increase your bounces, keep in mind, you may not see a difference if

210
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.400
you go past like 10 because the eye is not going to pick up those bounce upon another

211
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.640
bounce upon another bounce.

212
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.320
So it'll be very minute changes.

213
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.400
You can also make a static object glow.

214
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.160
So if you have like some simple lights in a city scene, you can actually bake that in

215
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.840
there. If you wanted to, you could even do that for on the real cheap, bake it ahead

216
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.240
of time and still use lumen if you are afraid of noise and the objects, you know, are

217
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.560
static, such as maybe a car and a neon light that would actually work pretty well.

218
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.160
But just keep in mind, if your characters walk in front of that bake, they're not going

219
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.240
to get that light. So just be aware of it.

220
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.880
Here's a link here diving deeper into those topics that we talked about in the next

221
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.600
lesson. We're going to take a look at screen space GI.

222
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.560
Thanks again.
