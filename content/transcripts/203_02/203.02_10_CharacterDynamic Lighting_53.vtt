1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this lesson, we're going to explore character dynamic lighting with Unreal.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's get started.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So setting it up.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When lighting characters try to use colors in the background that complement the character's tone.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
With a character having a tan skin tone, peach, blue can complement them when placed behind them.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now you'll see this in Love, Death and Robots, the Entombed project I worked with, Sony Imageworks and Unreal.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You'll see that there's a blue color back behind the characters, pretty consistent through most of the film.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But it works really well with these tan skin colors of most of the characters in the episode.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now you'll notice I have some rim lighting in here too, which works really well.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And this overall and several of the shots that I worked on like this worked really well like that.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But you'll also notice there is a bit more shadow on one side of the face versus another.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So also for dynamic lighting, try to keep that line to one side of the face.

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, again, you'll see it again on this image down below with a metahuman of myself.

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is available if you want to light this particular character in the baked project that I give you.

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So you're more than welcome to.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We're going to mainly focus on Lumen when we light our character.

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And we'll take a look at how you can do it and use some of the tools to get some of that really dramatic feel.

18
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, again, it's always good to try to explore those areas with lighting on your character where you want one side a little bit darker than the other.

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You will see in some shows like, you know, like, I don't know, soap operas and dramas where everything's kind of evenly lit.

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I never really like that.

21
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's always better to get a little bit some sort of drama, even in those particular environments, some sort of dramatic feel for the light and for the camera.

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Just to tell a good story and keep things interesting.

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That's the artist side of me.

24
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But again, it's all depending with your tools, with your shot.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Always explore and be creative and using your tools in a real can never be easier.

26
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And again, you can see for each one of three of these shots, and this is the one called the Crimson Claw scene that will be lighting.

27
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You'll notice there is a rim lighting here.

28
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There's rim lighting here and there's rim lighting here.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
All three that I've established and built.

30
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, again, you can have some fun with this and explore it any way you want.

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You don't necessarily have to light exactly like me.

32
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But let's actually take a look at those tools in just a bit.

33
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So one of the lights I'm going to point out that I use quite often is the rec light.

34
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It is fantastic.

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And you can't hear me speak enough about it.

36
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It is the more expensive light.

37
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So keep that in mind when you're either baking lights and we have character examples for baking.

38
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And this one is included or whether you're using lumen.

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, lumen is really efficient.

40
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It can work really well.

41
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But be aware of some of the noise that may occur due to your your shadows and the unreal trying to digest and calculate the GI on the camera.

42
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So just be very deterministic and be careful and just be aware of them and move things around accordingly.

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now, again, lumen is evolving.

44
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's going to get better, faster, stronger or the noise can and will be eventually completely removed.

45
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But for now, there's always going to be a little bit.

46
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So be very strategic with your shots and how you place things in the world.

47
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's go ahead and take a look at this in Unreal and you can go ahead and follow along and build things with me.

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So in Unreal, we have our hero, the light.

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In Unreal, we have our hero, the crimson claw.

50
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You have to say it every time you say his name.

51
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm going to say that deep.

52
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You can see him fighting back the evil manys here, the mannequins or the man.

53
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We say we call him Manny, the male's Manny and the female's Quinn.

54
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So you can see him fighting them back, trying to get to him.

55
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you'll notice again, I have rim lighting.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I have some nice universal lighting in here.

57
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You can even add more fill lights in here, but this is shows you a nice little base to be able to play with and to work with.

58
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So let's actually light our own.

59
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I'm going to get you going in the right direction here.

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So to do that, let's go to our content browser here and we're going to go ahead and open up our scene.

61
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And we'll go to character lighting.

62
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This is where you can grab this underneath the class name.

63
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And then you'll see character lighting.

64
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And I'm going to go ahead and grab on the start.

65
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Let's go and click the start.

66
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We really just have nothing but glowing objects in here.

67
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And Lumen is working in that direction.

68
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Now we can actually get them to be a lot more stronger in our influence for here.

69
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But we got to add a few things such as Lumen GI and so forth.

70
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So since we're using Lumen, we can go to our project settings and double check and make sure everything's on.

71
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
One, let's make sure our shader model six is active.

72
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We can see it is active here, which is our primary.

73
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I also like to turn on the target shader formats here for Vulkan.

74
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
That actually helps, especially if you're bringing such things in.

75
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Let's go to rendering.

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Under rendering, let's double check.

77
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We have Lumen.

78
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We have Lumen reflections in here.

79
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Surface catch, detailed ray tracing.

80
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We can change these to to be more hit lighting for reflections.

81
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You can actually change it in the post-process volume.

82
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Virtual shadow maps supporting for ray tracing.

83
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
All these hit the checkboxes.

84
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And we, again, mesh distance field is already active in here.

85
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So if you want to look it up, you can.

86
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You can say, hey, man, is my mesh distance field in here ready to go?

87
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You really shouldn't have to.

88
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And you'll see here, allow.

89
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is a little bit different.

90
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We can see generate mesh distance field.

91
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This is the one that you want in here.

92
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Also, we should be good to go.

93
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Everything should be rocking.

94
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So let's go and get started with that.

95
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, the glows in here are given off light.

96
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You'll see that a little bit here on the head here.

97
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The glow here is not too strong on the shield, but it's definitely something I could explore more if I wanted to.

98
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Everything is grouped on him.

99
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So you would have to ungroup him to change some of those items.

100
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It just made it easier for me to place him in the world.

101
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Let's go ahead and go to our tools here.

102
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Actually, I should say Windows environment light mixer.

103
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Let's go and create a skylight.

104
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You'll get an error at first, but we've talked about this in previous classes.

105
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We're going to create a volumetric to clear some of that out.

106
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Create an atmospheric light.

107
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Create a sky atmosphere.

108
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You'll see that disappear.

109
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Create a volumetric cloud and create a height fog.

110
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
There we go.

111
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So let's go and rotate that light in the direction that we need.

112
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So let's grab that directional light.

113
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Let's move it into our scene a bit here.

114
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's pretty close by.

115
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There he is.

116
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Let's pull this up.

117
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Now, if you want to, you can rotate this any way that you want.

118
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We can make it look like it's a moonlit night and have a light kind of bleed across the hero's face.

119
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And if we want to, we can lower this to like a five or two.

120
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We can give it a bluish color like Hollywood does that.

121
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Moonlight's always blue, right?

122
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Not real light.

123
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We can do that if you want to.

124
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
A little dramatic.

125
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And we can go in here and soften things up a little bit with the source angle.

126
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
If the shadows aren't as blurry as we want.

127
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But actually, these look pretty good.

128
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
They're pretty good.

129
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So we can always revisit that if you want to.

130
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We want to have a post-process volume.

131
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Now, I have one already in here.

132
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But again, put this in here as you need.

133
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We can set this to lumen.

134
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Set the method to lumen.

135
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Also, we want hit reflection in here.

136
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And we want to go in here and underneath lumen, low illumination, turn all these on as well as the advanced.

137
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now, start low and then go high.

138
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Always remember that.

139
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So I'm going to bump up the lumen scene quality and the lumen scene detail.

140
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Now, again, these are expensive GPUs.

141
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So if your computer is a little bit questionable, be careful with it.

142
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Final Gather is going to help get rid of some of the noise that may occur.

143
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You can see that there.

144
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Unreal's even telling you that.

145
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And I think we're in a good spot to be able to keep rolling and light things.

146
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now, we've covered some of that in other classes.

147
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So explore as you need.

148
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I don't want us to get too caught up with the details.

149
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Because we do need to place lights in here.

150
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So I'm going to pull in a rec light initially.

151
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm going to rotate him and make sure he's not intersecting with geometry.

152
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So there can be some noise that occurs.

153
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
That happens quite often with ray tracing because Unreal doesn't know where the photons begin and end.

154
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I'm going to place this up into the scene.

155
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm going to set this at a really low amount.

156
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So we'll set this to like maybe a two.

157
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And we can stretch this out.

158
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we can go ahead and set this to like a three.

159
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Make sure you do it in the details and not anywhere else.

160
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You can you can feel free to actually go in here and play with this a bit more with Alex.

161
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Kind of cool.

162
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Nice little highlights off his suit.

163
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And you can determine whether you want shadows to come off this.

164
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's up to you.

165
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So I'm going to do that a little bit dramatic.

166
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I do want a little bit of that redness coming off his shield.

167
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So I'm going to pull in and make sure that he's not intersecting with geometry.

168
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And I'm going to go ahead and set this to like maybe a two.

169
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And we can stretch this out.

170
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Make sure you do it in the details and not anywhere else.

171
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So I'm going to do that a little bit dramatic.

172
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I do want a little bit of that redness coming off his shield.

173
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So I'm going to pull in and make again, make sure your lights are movable so that the GI updates appropriately.

174
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And I'm going to go and pull in a point light.

175
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You may not think, oh, well, my my stationery is working.

176
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
No, you still want to do movable because anything you change in your post-process volume is going to make sense to Unreal.

177
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
If it's stationary, it will not make sense.

178
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It will be very weird and Unreal will not obey and do what you want.

179
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Your intentions will not be clear because you're not connecting a dynamic light with a dynamic GI setup.

180
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
You see, has a little EEC line going on for our hero.

181
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Let's set this to like a two and make this red.

182
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And actually, we can even make it lighter.

183
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Seems like a little strong so we can make that maybe a point five.

184
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
There we go. Pretty cool.

185
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
A little different than what we had before.

186
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I like this highlight better than my original.

187
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's pretty cool.

188
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I got a little fog material on here.

189
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Unreal did a nice little transition when I brought in the material from Maya.

190
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
It created a new to control that material made like a fog material.

191
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
There are a few limitations with that, but it's like a.

192
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
If we look at it.

193
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, I won't bother looking at it, but if you did crack this up and you will see a material function buried in there, it's OK.

194
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I like it for this particular case.

195
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I think it looks fantastic.

196
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But if you need to make some more details, you may want to swap that out and just adjust it and remove that material function and just use Unreal's materials from there using roughness and a few other things.

197
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Quick material note.

198
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Now let's go ahead and bump up a few things such as some dramatic lighting.

199
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So I'm going to pull in some rec light, a rec light in here.

200
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
This rec light will rotate this.

201
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Do a 90 degree rotate.

202
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Move this back just a bit.

203
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Get some cool rim lighting.

204
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Move it up a little bit, stretch it out so it covers a little bit more.

205
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Oh, that's nice.

206
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And then we can lean that in just a tad.

207
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We don't want it too strong, so we're going to set this to like maybe a three.

208
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We could even do a four half the amount.

209
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Tell it not to cast shadows.

210
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And we can also tell this point light not to cast shadows either.

211
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And again, make sure your lights are movable when you select them.

212
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We're going to say don't cast shadows.

213
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
This also needs to be movable.

214
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Set that to movable.

215
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
There we go. So far, so great.

216
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Do we want this to cast shadows? Yeah, it's kind of cool.

217
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It actually works pretty well, so we can leave that.

218
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We're going to need a few more rec lights in here and I'm going to need maybe one more here to get a dramatic shadow in the face.

219
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So let's pull on another rec light.

220
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Again, they are expensive, so keep those things in mind.

221
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Move this over.

222
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Move this up.

223
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Change the source width.

224
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Notice it changes the energy.

225
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Change the source height.

226
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Set this to like a two.

227
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And maybe even lower. Let's do a .5.

228
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And if we want, we can fake this like moonlight. What?

229
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Make it slightly blue.

230
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Even more blue if you want. It's up to you.

231
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And even take this to a one if you want at that point.

232
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Or a two. Or a three.

233
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's up to you.

234
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Pretty cool. Pretty cool.

235
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
A little blue casting behind him, which will work great with the skin.

236
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Oh my.

237
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I don't want every light in here to cast shadow, so we definitely can turn that one off too.

238
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So now we got our villains we want to handle.

239
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And we can probably lower the highlight of the suit to a one.

240
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
There you go. Or maybe even a two.

241
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Let me see. 1.5. I think will work. 1.5.

242
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
There we go. All happy medium.

243
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We're going to do one more fill light for the whole scene.

244
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So let's do some rim lights. I'll keep it pretty brief because we don't want this to be too long of a lecture.

245
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I'm going to go ahead and pull on a rec light.

246
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And we'll do a source width.

247
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Do a bit of a source height.

248
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
A little more of a width because we can get this more of a narrow highlight.

249
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Ooh, that's kind of cool.

250
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Almost like a Jack Kirby highlight.

251
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I know I'm such a comic nerd.

252
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Oh, let me do controls here for a second.

253
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Turn it this way.

254
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Change the width a little bit.

255
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Lower it.

256
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Set it to now object rotation versus world.

257
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Don't cast shadows.

258
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Lower that strength and like one could even do a little bit stronger.

259
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I'll leave that for now.

260
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Because we'll do another fill light here over here.

261
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Just a little one.

262
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now, if you brought in, say, a point light, you're like, oh, I need to fill this a little bit.

263
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You got to be careful. Hot spots have a shiny object here.

264
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So you can use it. And again, remember, we talked about this.

265
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You can lower the spec so the shape doesn't show up or you can go in here and control the source soft source radius.

266
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So we can bump that up a little bit so it doesn't quite affect things too much because we want it to fill not necessarily take up space.

267
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And we can set this to one.

268
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And move it up a little bit.

269
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And it can be a nice little fill light there.

270
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
You can determine where you want to put it.

271
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
What a highlight a little bit more.

272
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Rec lights are always a little bit better for this, but I just thought I'd put a point line in just to show you a bunch of tools to play with.

273
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
All right. So we want to do a little rim lighting for him and a little fill lights for him.

274
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So let's go pull out another rec light.

275
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We can change that color whatever we want for this particular character.

276
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
There we'll have it facing him. Change the width.

277
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Change the strength.

278
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Rotate it.

279
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Oh, that's nice.

280
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
We got like a nice little rim lighting off this character here.

281
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Turn off the shadows. No casting the shadows for that.

282
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And in this particular one where we have the rec light here we can even move this in a little closer.

283
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And if we do, we can get maybe a little more highlights on that limb that he has his limbs fading back there.

284
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So I could do something like this.

285
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Like this, just by positioning things.

286
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
There we go.

287
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Now we're getting quite as dramatic as are my example here.

288
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
So what we can do if we wanted to is bump this up a little bit more.

289
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Kind of do like it a little bit stronger. That's up to you.

290
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Makes the robots seem like they've taken over a little mood lighting in here.

291
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Or we can even lower that down to maybe a one if you wanted to.

292
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And our directional light, if that's an issue, lower it some more.

293
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Put it to one here. So our primary lights are environment.

294
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And then we can take some of these and dumb them down even more.

295
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Point five here.

296
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And we can make this one too.

297
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It's up to you. And then now we can crank this one up maybe a little bit more.

298
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And again, you can change the mood of all your colors if you want.

299
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Whatever you want to do.

300
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And you can see dramatically this really has a good vibe.

301
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So you can play with these any way you want.

302
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I think a bluish gray works pretty well.

303
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Even more extreme blue too. Pushing blue a little bit farther.

304
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Now if we change this to more of a white,

305
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
you'll see it changes the complete feel for this scene.

306
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Dramatic, not so dramatic.

307
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
You can see that.

308
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Now if we want shadows on these at any time, you can add them.

309
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So we can say I want to cast a shadow here.

310
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
That actually helps the TVs.

311
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
A more believable feel to them.

312
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And again, when you bring in these lights, switch it to movable.

313
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Notice they're coming in stationary.

314
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Directional by default will become movable, but the others will not.

315
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Make sure you click on that.

316
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So finally in here, I think we're at a good spot.

317
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
If we wanted to, we could even make it a bit darker.

318
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Just by changing these values, you'll notice changing these just a little bit can help with the look and feel that you need.

319
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Again, all of these are relating to the world.

320
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
So if at any time you want to bring in the shadows, you can.

321
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
They may help or may not.

322
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Office lighting obviously will give you more shadows as you play with these.

323
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
As you pull them in, you'll see them come in here, make things a little more grounded and believable.

324
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
They will remove highlights too, so be careful with that.

325
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And finally, if we wanted to, we can actually put in one more very low rec light right beside his head.

326
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Rotate this.

327
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Move it up for more dramatic feel.

328
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Change that width.

329
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And change that strength.

330
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
We'll do that.

331
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We'll do something like a one to test it out.

332
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
It kind of looks like an animated series there.

333
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
We can move it closer to his face.

334
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And this particular rec light here, we can lower this one so it doesn't has less of an influence over there.

335
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Now, this is really up to you how you want to do this.

336
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And you can also change the dramatic positioning.

337
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Of our light here.

338
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And then we can lower some of the other ones in here as a whole.

339
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And move things around as you need.

340
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
That way your characters don't get lost.

341
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And we can also probably add one more rim lighting here for the robot.

342
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Move that in.

343
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Move it across.

344
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And let's switch that to object.

345
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So it's a little easier to move around.

346
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And we could change that to like a pink color.

347
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Look like he got shot with electric pink death.

348
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I'm pretty sure that's the name of his weapon.

349
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
It could be.

350
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
We just open this up.

351
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Set this to a two.

352
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
There you go.

353
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And then again, we can mess with our barn door angle.

354
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
So we can make that a little more focused.

355
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Or opened up.

356
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Move it down.

357
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And even rotate this towards them.

358
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
So they both look like they got shot.

359
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Cool.

360
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
So I hope this helped you guys out on different approaches you can do.

361
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Again, make sure it's movable.

362
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And you can play with your lights.

363
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You can make any scene that you want as dramatic as you want.

364
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Just have some fun with it.

365
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And if I hit the G key, you can see everything within its intended look and feel.

366
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And we did this all in real time.

367
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
We aren't getting much noise, which is fantastic.

368
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
We also could play with some of the reflectivity here.

369
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
You'll notice in the post process volume.

370
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
If you go back to the post process one, just type it in.

371
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
You want to make sure that you are using your reflectivity with lumen.

372
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
But also in your project settings, we can go in here under rendering.

373
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And I'll make it so you can see this a bit better.

374
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
We can go in here and say, move down here underneath reflections.

375
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
We're using.

376
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Go down here.

377
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Where do you want to go here?

378
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
We can change like hit reflections and then we have detailed.

379
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Tracing again, you can do that within your post process volume too,

380
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
so you can get things in the right direction.

381
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So this is going to give us like the best possible detail for our reflections.

382
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And again, keeping things lumen is going to be super, super, super helpful.

383
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And with ray tracing active and so forth.

384
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
All right, so that's about it with this one.

385
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And again, if you have any questions at the end of our courses,

386
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
and let's actually turn high transition reflections here and turn that one on.

387
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
You'll see a little bit of shift.

388
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
If you have any other questions on these, let us know.

389
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And we'll be there to help you and get you going in the right direction when it comes to Unreal.

390
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
For further exploration with Unreal, you can actually look at our characters

391
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
that are nested inside the bake lighting folder and the big lighting scene.

392
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And you can play with some of the things there.

393
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Keep in mind, they are more focused on baking.

394
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
So feel free to convert the whole thing into lumen and play with them a bit farther

395
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
and see what kind of results you get.

396
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Here's some credits again for all those that have worked on this project.

397
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And here's some of the things that we've done.

398
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So that's all we have for now.

399
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
