00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at reflections

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.120
when it comes to baking.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.960
So let's get started.

4
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.240
So first, we want to talk about when to use them.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.280
So reflections are to be used with primary reflective

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280
surfaces, giving them the illusion

7
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.240
of believable reflective materials and substances.

8
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.040
If they aren't used, Unreal will use screen space

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.520
reflection as a default. And that's not always

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.760
the best way to represent your visuals, especially

11
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760
when you're baking.

12
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.760
So using the reflection capture elements

13
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.160
creates a more detailed, believable reflection.

14
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.000
And you can find them under Modes, Visual Effects.

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.560
The types that can be used are as follows.

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.600
We have screen space by default, spherical reflections,

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.800
box reflections, and planar reflections.

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.240
I'll walk you through some of these

19
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.200
and I'll bring one into Unreal briefly

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
and we'll get back to the slides so you can see how they work.

21
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.680
So to be able to call them up, we

22
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.400
can simply type in here under Place Actors, the reflection

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.760
here, and you'll see we have box reflection, planar reflection,

24
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.240
and sphere reflection capture.

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.560
Now sphere for things that are a bit more rounded

26
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.920
or more organic, box for obviously things

27
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.840
a little bit more box in size and shape,

28
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.760
and then, or I should say, this is planar,

29
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.280
box on the top for the size and shape, planar for things

30
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.480
if you like have your body of water

31
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.280
or things that you really need the reflection to be realistic.

32
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.560
And again, this is a baking scenario

33
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.040
and is not needed with Lumen.

34
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.560
Lumen has its own reflectivity properties.

35
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.840
It borrows from ray tracing, but in it,

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.120
it also has a boost where it's actually

37
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.080
using global illumination in its reflectivity.

38
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.360
So it's actually pretty great to be able to see that.

39
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.120
Now in here, you can also type in here under Get Content.

40
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.560
You can type reflection, and you'll

41
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.160
see those same ones come in.

42
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.760
You can see here I have a sphere here, reflection capture.

43
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.280
Now this one, I can control its influence radius.

44
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.120
So if I need to make it bigger or smaller,

45
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.280
it actually can help.

46
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.880
And you'll see those highlights show up

47
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.760
on that rock at the distance, and it

48
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520
shift on the sphere itself.

49
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.200
So this is really up to you how you place it.

50
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.880
And as you place it, Unreal will try to update initially.

51
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.040
And as it does, then you want to make sure

52
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.760
that you're running another reflection capture

53
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.560
build right here.

54
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.600
So let's go back to the slides.

55
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.440
So note again, reflection captures are used for baking

56
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.840
and are not necessary for ray tracing,

57
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.840
but I do highly recommend them because they can help.

58
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.520
So if you do use ray tracing, which

59
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400
we'll go over in another class, ray tracing

60
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.200
has real-time reflections with no rebaking needed,

61
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.480
but a hybrid of both can be used to help performance.

62
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240
And visuals, I should add.

63
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.400
So when you use a reflection capture,

64
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.320
you can actually tell ray tracing to lean on them,

65
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.160
like be able to borrow some of that.

66
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.000
Now again, we go into that CVAR in detail

67
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.080
and that breakdown in another course

68
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.800
talking about ray tracing, but I just

69
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.200
wanted to point that out.

70
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.360
So screen space reflections can also

71
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.840
be controlled in the post-process volume.

72
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.600
There you can control the intensity, the quality,

73
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.800
and the roughness.

74
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.840
But keep in mind, it's based on the positioning of your camera.

75
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.040
So if I move my camera around, that screen space

76
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.960
could warp and distort.

77
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.760
And obviously, it's not going to give me fully accurate

78
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.680
reflections.

79
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.520
So the sphere reflection and box reflections, again,

80
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.640
we can control the radius of that.

81
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.040
But you can also load a cube map if you need to by changing

82
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.880
the reflection source type.

83
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.400
This is really up to you.

84
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.800
You can also control brightness as well as the angle.

85
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.360
So this depends if you're loading a source in there.

86
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.400
So you can't load your own if you have a cube map that you

87
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.640
want to load and you want that reflection to represent that.

88
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.920
So another way to be able to adjust your reflections

89
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.760
is if you use in the baking method,

90
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.560
Unreal 4 as well as Unreal 5 supports the planar reflections.

91
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.080
So planar reflections are expensive, keep in mind.

92
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.360
And some of your effects may not show up in it.

93
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.800
So if you're using older Cascade or Niagara,

94
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.880
they may not show up in the reflection.

95
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.040
But it does give you accurate reflections.

96
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.160
It's just kind of a good way to do it.

97
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.200
So if you're using a real-time camera,

98
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.800
it's just kind of expensive.

99
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.440
Again, when you can to try to use Lumen.

100
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.520
And this is a fallback if you needed

101
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.120
to use it for a particular shot or necessary part

102
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.880
of a lower end game and you're noticing that the Lumen isn't

103
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.000
quite what you're looking for.

104
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.600
So these are just informative areas

105
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.880
that you can think of that you can add to your scene

106
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.560
if you had to use baking.

107
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.840
So just keep these things in mind.

108
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.720
Be very deterministic and don't rule out Lumen.

109
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.080
But this is also, I want to put this in your screen.

110
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.000
So if you're using a camera, you

111
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.880
can use the Lumen as a secondary to be able to have an option

112
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.680
if you need to.

113
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.000
So again, we have scenarios for it.

114
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.760
Using the sphere for more spherical or rounded surfaces.

115
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.120
You can get away with using it for hard flat surfaces that

116
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.280
are more box-shaped.

117
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.160
But you have to make sure that the spherical reflection is

118
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.920
pretty close to the point of interest.

119
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.640
So if you're using a camera, you can use the Lumen as a secondary

120
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.240
to have an option to have a more spherical reflection.

121
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.880
And start to break down to become a spherical type

122
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.840
of reflection or warping.

123
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.960
And we want to avoid that.

124
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.000
You do have building quality, which

125
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.280
we mentioned in the earlier part of the course,

126
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.880
where you can control reflection capture resolution.

127
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.360
So if you're going to use them, try

128
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.800
to keep them relatively high if you can.

129
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.920
We lower those a bit.

130
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.080
But 2048 and 1024 is good for more PC games,

131
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.080
centric, or maybe even final pixel.

132
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.960
But definitely can support ray tracing better

133
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.440
to have a higher quality.

134
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.240
Tips and tricks here.

135
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.960
Reflections are used for light baking.

136
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.040
Again, not calculated in a ray-traced scenario

137
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.800
because you don't have to rebuild them.

138
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.880
But it can add some detail and give a little optical illusion

139
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.440
to it.

140
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.840
It actually is a fallback.

141
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.400
You can think of it that way for ray tracing.

142
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.680
Uses that data that that spherical reflection capture

143
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.600
comes into play and allows you to get a better quality

144
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600
and bounce in your reflectivity.

145
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.400
You'll see here a few more tips.

146
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.880
And again, keep your resolution high,

147
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.080
especially if you're making your own.

148
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.320
Here's another link that gives you a little bit more

149
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680
in depth than that if you dive into it.

150
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.560
And that's about it with this course.

151
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.480
In the next course, we'll look at view modes and visualizers

152
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.280
when it comes to Unreal and analyzing your scene.
