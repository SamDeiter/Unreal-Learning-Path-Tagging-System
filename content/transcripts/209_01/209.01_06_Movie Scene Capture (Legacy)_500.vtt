00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So looking at the movie scene capture in Sequencer,

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760
so there's a legacy tool which we're deprecating.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.560
It's really good for rendering videos for AVI

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.220
and the general purpose capture for cinematic output.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.860
So it supports custom render passes, HDR exporting,

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.940
but it doesn't support high resolution rendering.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.300
So currently still the only option for exporting

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.940
self-contained AVI files, but that may change.

9
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.700
So from the drop down here,

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.400
you can see that the movie scene capture tool

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.600
can still be used.

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.280
You've got some of your settings here.

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.400
Again, it outputs an AVI file,

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.360
but we are moving over to the movie render queue.

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.740
So just in case you wanted to use the legacy tool,

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.380
it was worth highlighting there.

17
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.160
And then also the HDR exporting,

18
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
so you can export HDR data in open EXI files.

19
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.760
So you can specify a HDR compression quality,

20
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.620
and then also specify the capture gamut.

21
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.620
So whether it's Rec.709, the P3D65,

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.280
or even the more recent Rec.2020 and the ACES,

23
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
and the ACES-CG, and render passes,

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.460
the limited render pass option is not rendered layers.

25
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.620
So at least one of the render passes must be selected,

26
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.500
or all render passes options will be rendered.

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.860
So again, you've got your settings here

28
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.840
that you can adjust for the movie render settings.

29
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.080
It's worth digging into some of the different options

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.120
that you wanna capture here.

31
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.920
And then also when referencing the capture gamut

32
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.640
that you need to specify,

33
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.880
that's in this section down below.
