00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
To give you an overview of the OpenColor I.O., color management, Unreal Engine offers built-in

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.040
support for OpenColor I.O. to convert colors of linear media in several ways.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.280
So when you use media source like captured clips or live feeds in your project, you can

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.960
apply the color conversion to make sure those media sources match your computer generated

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.640
elements in Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.240
So while you're working, you can apply the color conversions to your viewport, and this

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.720
will be helpful so that the reference frames you see as you are working in the editor will

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.880
be consistent with your chosen color space.

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.760
You can then reapply another color conversion to the composited feed, your output from Composure,

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.720
and this really helps with CG elements and live frames to help them blend more convincingly

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.880
whilst preserving the colors of the original shots faithfully.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.560
So you can export using the movie render queue, which we'll go over in a few slides here,

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.880
and you can choose to apply a color space transformation to your output video.

14
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.480
And then a new asset is the OpenColor Configuration asset, which you'll use to manage the color

15
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.080
profiles that you want to work with.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.920
So from your plugins, you just want to make sure you go to the edit window, go down to

17
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.280
plugins and check for OpenColor I.O. and make sure it's enabled.

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.040
If it wasn't enabled, you'll just have to restart your editor and then you should be

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.840
good to go with OpenColor I.O.
