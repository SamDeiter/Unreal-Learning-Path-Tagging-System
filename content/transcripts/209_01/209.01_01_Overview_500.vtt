00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine Training on post-processing and rendering.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.280
Today we'll be covering a few different things.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.840
We'll mostly be talking about color control flow, post-process, whether it be look and

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.360
feel, how lumen and ray tracing may affect this.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.800
We'll talk about lookup tables and open color I.O.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.540
We'll go into some post-process volume exposure settings and then talk a little bit about

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.640
depth of field.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.640
And then on the rendering side, we'll be talking about how to render out movies via

9
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
a sequencer.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
We'll go into the movie render queue.

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.640
We'll talk about console variables and the GPU timeouts.
