Thank you for watching today's video on post-processing and rendering.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.720
Hopefully gave you a good overview of exactly how Unreal Engine handles the render buffers,

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.720
the different settings you can use to really drive home the look and feel of the projects

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.440
that you're working on. We covered a lot of ground, whether it be some of the plugins

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.000
that you can use in Unreal Engine or some of the properties that you might be able to edit

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.640
in post-process volumes or materials and looking at lookup tables, but hopefully gave

7
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.400
you a good overview for you to start really defining the look and feel of your project,

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.920
and we'll see you on the next course.
