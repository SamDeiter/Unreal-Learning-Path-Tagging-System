00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
Next, let's dig into talking about some post-process volume properties that you can edit.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.780
And first we'll talk about exposure adjustments versus raw.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.900
So you can create an auto exposure, but adjust its range to keep it in the min max.

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.420
So if you see here, we've got some exposure settings on our post-process volume and you

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.840
have this min EV100 and max EV100, which you can use to clamp some values.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
And you can also adjust it under the lit menu inside your editor.

7
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.400
If you click on lit and go down to game settings, you can tick that or untick it.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.240
And then you also have a slider here to compensate for the exposure in this section here.

9
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.400
You can also do exposure adjustments and visualize them in the editor.

10
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.840
So if you want to visualize the adaptation under show, go to HDR eye adaptation.

11
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.600
So you click show at the top here and then go down to visualize and then HDR and you

12
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.400
can preview that eye adaptation.

13
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.240
And then you can also preview the depth of field in your shots as well.

14
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.760
So a cinematic depth of field, green is the foreground, black is the focus object and

15
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.160
then blue are any of the background objects.

16
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.340
So we've got a procedural diaphragm simulation.

17
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.160
So that means that the control, this controls a number of diaphragm blades, which is the

18
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.760
iris to directly influence bokeh shape.

19
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.200
And then aperture can be as small as desired, but has a maximum based on lens size, which

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
is your f-stop.

21
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.880
The aperture does not control light intensity so that you don't have to continually adjust

22
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
the exposure.

23
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.640
So you can see this depth of field diagram here where if you want a shallow depth of

24
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920
field, you want a large aperture.

25
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.400
If you want some deep depth of field, you want to really narrow that aperture and make

26
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.560
it quite a small source that the light can get through there.

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.160
And then to touch upon the use of path tracer when working with depth of field.

28
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.600
In the past versions of path tracer, there was a major issue with translucency and depth

29
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.280
And the problem was that the translucent material wouldn't render to the depth buffer.

30
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.800
So essentially you weren't getting accurate depth of field.

31
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.360
So in the path tracer settings now, you can remedy that by the tick box here.

32
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.080
So reference depth of field.

33
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.960
And if you enable that, that will fix any legacy issues that you may have had previously.

34
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.840
And to close out, there's many different documentation.

35
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
So if you've heard anything in the previous few slides that you think you want to know

36
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.400
more about, maybe you want to know more about open color IO or any of the post process effects,

37
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.960
any rendering topics, you can find all the documentation here.

38
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.800
And these slides were put together by Sean Rod and Cami.
