00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
If you're using the movie render queue, however, this allows us to add multiple sequences so we can customize the output settings essentially.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.960
So you have two different settings here.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.880
You've got the render local, which will render locally and the same way the Unreal Engine and similar to how plain editor would work.

4
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.280
If you want to render remotely, however, this is more resource intensive and does not run the editor's code.

5
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.880
So projects must be saved to do that.

6
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.600
So the two options are at the bottom here, whether you choose to render local or render remote.

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.240
And there's additional documentation if you need to know more about both of those options.

8
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.840
You can also customize the render settings, whether it be project wide or even shot by shot.

9
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.400
So you can select and add the render settings, the export file types and render output options.

10
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.160
And you can create some render presets so you can share those presets across the team.

11
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.080
You can just share them across different projects if you want.

12
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.640
And it's a really nice, efficient way of working to get consistent quality output either across many shots in the projects or even across many different projects.

13
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.960
And the movie render queue currently supports anti-aliasing and the burn in, whether default or custom.

14
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.040
We've got camera shutter control.

15
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.320
You can edit the console variables and the movie render queue will take into account any console variables you've set, which again, we've got some tips for later in the slides here.

16
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080
We've got some game overrides that you can do.

17
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.640
You've got the high resolution output, which the previous render option didn't have.

18
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.640
So you've got tile count, which are image breaks, overlap ratio and texture sharpness bias.

19
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.000
And we also support ray tracing and lumen with the movie render queue.

20
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.360
Which is a great handy feature to have.

21
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.760
So the high quality media export user benefits are virtual production is high quality anti-aliasing and motion blur.

22
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.360
On the gaming side, you've got higher quality cinematics with less artifacting from motion blur and temporal anti-aliasing.

23
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.280
For the automotive side, you might have the temporal supersampling, rotational motion blur, high resolution tiling for larger image output.

24
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.480
And on the archviz side, you've got spatial supersampling for anti-aliased image with little ray tracing noise.
