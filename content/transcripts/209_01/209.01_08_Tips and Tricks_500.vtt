00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Next, we want to provide a few tips and tricks for your rendering inside of Unreal Engine 5,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that it helps give you some efficiencies in your workflow.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So kicking off with Lumen here, Lumen currently doesn't fully support mirror reflections.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So it's limited, but on the roadmap, so at the time of viewing,

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you can just check the support of Lumen on the reflections here.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And Lumen does not support static lights either.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So you're in a, whereas if you are using baked lighting,

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you could change your light modes to static, stationary, movable.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Lumen just handles the same light type for all.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So disabling allow static lighting can help with some overhead

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and make sure your Lumen AO process is working with no visual hindrances.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Lumen supports material ambient occlusion, ideal for characters,

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
cheaper than a bent normal for characters.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So with Lumen, temporal super resolution, which is TSR,

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
may blur out the world position offset effect.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
To remedy that, you can go to your project settings,

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
go down to the render tab, into optimizations, velocity pass,

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and switch to right during base pass.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And making foliage movable in the foliage editor can also correct the blurring caused

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by the world position offset, which is the wind effect.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And then there's just an image to show you about the velocity pass option

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that you'd change there.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
With path tracer, we're talking about denoising.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So even with high sample counts, path tracer will always have a bit of residual noise

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in the rendered frame.

26
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So denoising option in the post-processing volume settings will make use of

27
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Intel's open image denoise library to remove noise from the last sample.

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So the denoiser runs on the CPU and is not currently designed for interactive denoising.

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So rather to help improve the quality of long running frames,

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it does not currently guarantee temporal consistency.

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And relatively high samples per pixel are required for stable output.

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So temporal stability can also be improved by increasing the temporal sample count

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in the anti-aliasing settings in the movie render queue.

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And then also animated items may still have flickering shadows.

35
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So setting spatial and temporal sampling counts to 10 can help.

36
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So path tracer is still evolving, many changes per engine version.

37
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So it's always useful checking the path tracer documentation,

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which we've got in a slide in a second for you to check the latest on path tracer.

39
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Here are a few common console variables that you may use for when you approach ray tracing.

40
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We've got some meta human specific CVAR settings here in orange,

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which you may want to tweak, but you can also find a list of these online.

42
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But again, the render queue supports console variables.

43
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So if you want to set any of these when you're outputting,

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and if you file types, you can set these on the project.

45
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And then you've also got some sky and atmosphere systems that you can tweak here.

46
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So worth digging into all of these, playing around,

47
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
seeing what you can set and really define the look and feel of what your project requires.

48
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The GPU timeouts, so the TDR delay settings,

49
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
type regedit into the Windows search bar to navigate to this category,

50
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
select the TDR delay from the list, right click modify,

51
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and you can select the base's decimal.

52
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So change the value data to 1690 or 120, and then hit OK.

53
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And if the TDR delay doesn't exist in the category list,

54
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
move your pointer to the open folder, right click,

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
select new select D word, which is 32 bit value from the options menu,

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and then select the base's decimal.

57
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Hit the value data to 1690 or 120 again, and then hit OK.

58
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So all of the documentation that you need for any of these tips and tricks

59
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
can be found on the resources below.

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And then just for the credits of the slides again, this was Kevin and Sean.

61
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We got further documentation on some sequence of workflows,

62
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and then also some additional documentation on the movie render queue.
