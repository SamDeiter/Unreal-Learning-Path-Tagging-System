  "text": " Now that we have our material set on our particle, let's go ahead and adjust some of our parameters to make this look less like a fountain and more like smoke. To do that, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to adjust the spawn rate, the lifetime, and the size. The reason for this is by default it spawns at about 90 particles a second, and that's way too many. We want to set that to about 20. We're then going to set the lifetime because we want these particles to last for 10 seconds instead of a random amount of time. And then next we want to set the particle size to uniform because we want these to be relatively large bits of smoke. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and do that now. So to find these, we're going to click on our particle spawn. And the first thing that we're going to change here is our lifetime mode. We're going to set this to direct set, and we're going to set this to a value of 10. So there we go. And then we are going to set our sprite size here from random uniform to uniform and change that to a value of 64. And last but not least, we need to come up to our emitter spawn rate and then set that to a value of 20. Now, if I hit play on mine, we're going to see here that we don't have as many particles coming out as we did before, and they are lasting a lot longer.",
