00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.799
Coming back to our zombie walk, you know, we're pretty happy with the lower body, but

2
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.980
I think maybe we should experiment a bit more with the upper body and with the arms.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.439
So for that we're going to use the layered blend per bone node.

4
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.480
Now this allows us to selectively blend different animations together on different parts of

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480
the body.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.980
So we could split up the body into different groups of bones, giving us a really easy way

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.039
to separate things like the upper and lower body or the arms and the legs and just affect

8
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.740
those parts of the body with the animations that we want.

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.439
In our anim graph, I'm going to right click and search for layered blend per bone and

10
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.640
bring in our layered blend per bone node here.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.120
I'll also bring in the creep walk, which is, if I remember rightly, the basis of our zombie

12
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.039
animation and connect that to the output pose and tick looping.

13
00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.839
And if we compile, there we go, we have our creep walk playing.

14
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.840
I'm then going to bring in our full loop animation because if I double click this to open it

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.159
up, I know it has some upper body animation on there, but I think it adds some coolness

16
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.799
to the zombie walk.

17
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.900
So if I plug that into our blend pose is zero pin and set that to looping again and compile,

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.340
you can see that it's not yet having an effect on our animation.

19
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.500
And that's just because we haven't defined which bones we want the animation to play

20
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.219
on yet.

21
00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.500
So selecting our layered blend per bone node again.

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.219
In the details panel under the config heading, we have layer setup.

23
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.620
And inside there, we've got index zero.

24
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.060
Now this is relating to our blend poses zero input pin.

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.100
If I was to hit add pin, you'll see we get a new index.

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.260
So when you want to blend multiple animations together, that's how you do it, but we'll

27
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.379
take a look at that in a bit.

28
00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.620
So under this index heading, we have branch filters where we can add multiple branches

29
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.980
and split this animation into different parts of the body or apply it to different parts

30
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.540
of the body.

31
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.939
So if I hit a plus there, we add a new index and I'm going to give it the name of the first

32
00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.500
bone in the chain that we want to affect.

33
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.539
And because we want to affect the upper body, I'm going to give it spine 04.

34
00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.020
So that's going to affect the upper chest and everything above that.

35
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.419
So if I compile, you can see on the lower body, we have the creep walk playing.

36
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.860
And then the upper body, the fall loop, because we have our alpha set to one, that's going

37
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.020
to play 100% of the fall loop animation.

38
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.740
So if I was to change that to 0.5, for example, you can see that we're now blending half of

39
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.900
that animation and we've got some of that creep walk movement underneath.

40
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.580
Now this is looking kind of cool, but I think we can get something a little better if we

41
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.719
break the body up into a few more pieces.

42
00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:03.140
So back into our layered blend per bone node, I'm going to add another pin here, duplicate

43
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.180
this fall loop animation with control D and connect that to our blend poses one pin because

44
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.700
I still like the way that this fall loop animation is affecting our pose and our animation, but

45
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.740
I want to break it up so that perhaps we have a different strength of this animation on maybe

46
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.360
the arms compared to what we have on the spine.

47
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.900
So we now have this new index here and under the branch filters, I'm going to add two new

48
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.120
branches, one for each arm.

49
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.520
So our start bone name is going to be clavicle L for the left arm and bone name for the right

50
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:49.599
arm clavicle R. So if I compile, as you can see, because our blend strength, our blend

51
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.560
weight should I say is set to one, we're getting 100% of that fall loop animation on the two

52
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.800
arms and 50% of the animation on the spine.

53
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.280
So I could tweak this again to something like 0.7 maybe and then compile.

54
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.880
So we still get some of that underlying creep walk animation on the arms, but we also have

55
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.320
the interesting pose from the fall loop.

56
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.680
Now this is looking kind of cool so far, but the head is maybe looking a little too stable

57
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.600
and I think with zombies they're always a little bit wobbly and maybe the head is like

58
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.040
snapping at you trying to bite you and something that I would think would work quite well for

59
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720
that is the run forward animation because this has got a lot more movement in it and

60
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.520
a lot more action going on.

61
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.240
So if I add a new pin and plug that into blend poses to and just make sure we're looping

62
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.680
that animation, I'm going to cut off the head and just apply this run forward to the head.

63
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.680
So if I just shrink that down these two indexes and opened upon newest and add a new branch,

64
00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.439
I'm going to use neck underscore 01 because I know that that's the first neck bone and

65
00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.639
we're going to affect everything after that, the tip of the head.

66
00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.759
So already you can see that's something kind of cool there.

67
00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.879
It's maybe a little bit strong, but you can imagine him kind of snapping and biting at

68
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.360
you.

69
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.360
Maybe I can reduce it down to 0.8 perhaps.

70
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.879
Yeah that's looking kind of cool there.

71
00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.060
So I think we could probably call the zombie animation done there.

72
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.740
Now you could do the same sort of thing with this animation where you could record it out

73
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.579
and create a loop of the animation again.

74
00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:34.699
You could also open the animation sequencer and bake that down to a control rig which

75
00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.699
will give you much more control over the loop making sure that there's no pop and you can

76
00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.819
add in any cool little details that you want to add to really polish it up.
