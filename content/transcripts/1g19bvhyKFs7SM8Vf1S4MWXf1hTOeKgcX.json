  "text": " All right, before we close out here, I just want to go over some of the final recommendations and best practices as you start your journey using Unreal Engine. So sometimes it can be a little hard to figure out what kind of GPU you need. So you want to analyze your entire production environment. Want to be thinking about the geometry and draw calls that are going to be happening inside your project, because these are the things that consume the most memory while you're rendering or working. Now you can tier the levels of your GPU based off the role of the person that you have working on your projects. So in general, a good rule of thumb to consider is that modelers, shading artists, and animators are typically going to be okay using the RTX 3000 and RTX 4000 series from Nvidia. Lighting, rendering, and virtual production are probably going to require some higher-end GPUs. So the RTX 6000 AIDA series and 5000 AIDA series are the top of the line right now. The RTX A6000, that's the Ampere series, and the RTX A5000 or A5500 if you're working on laptops are still really good because they're only the last generation. The Quadro RTX 8000 and the Quadro RTX 6000 are still good quality GPUs. I wouldn't discredit or discount them just yet, but they are on the lower end for high quality GPU choices. So figure out which ones you want to use, what your budget is, and then make your decisions based on what your actual production needs are. Now we already discussed some of this in a previous section, but I want to reiterate that level management and organization is going to be vital for your project and your production needs. You want to break down your environments into manageable separate levels. Place all commonly shared global actors in your persistent level. This is your sun, landscape, sky domes, anything that lives within the entire project that will be used by anybody collaborating with you. Add your actions into beats with specific scenes and create separate sub levels for each. Separate levels can be brought back into the persistent level by setting everything at the origin position or the 000 position in the world space. This is going to reduce floating point errors when using Unreal with DCC applications. This is also going to decrease large values in the details panel. Now you want to refine your levels with sub levels to help manage scene assembly organization. Resist having extensive numbers of sub levels. Too many can become a little difficult to manage. Level visibility tracks can also be helpful for turning on and off scene setups with Sequencer. And make sure that you keep your streaming methods set to always loaded on your sub levels. This is important for rendering purposes because if your streaming method is set to blueprint, it won't load in when it's time to render. And once again, consider using folders and layers to organize your outliner. And for shot planning and organization, consider shot planning to determine any adjacent scene environments. If you're traveling between scenes, consider optimizing your foreground, mid ground and backgrounds. A single level sequence is pretty good for setting up a main shot and you can combine this with multiple coverage cameras and a camera cuts track for some pretty simple shot based editing. However, nested level sequences are a little bit better and work together for distinct shot based workflows. These are better for executing nonlinear workflows and for collaborative teamwork. Each shot ends up being a separate level sequence. And you want to try not to exceed more than three levels of nesting. If you start out with sub scene tracks, you can nest all of the actions further down into one of those sub levels. In that instance, you might get close to exceeding that three levels of nesting, but it can be a little difficult to manage if you're not really on top of your organization structure. And then finally, while you're working with Sequencer, take full advantage of the take system for creating shot alternates. It's really handy to be able to start out with a single shot and really quickly iterate using our take system. And then finally here for asset organization, be sure to use possessable and spawnables wisely. There are a lot of benefits for each. Spawnables are good for temporary background actors. Spawnables are great for shot specific lighting modifications. Spawnables can make parenting situations a little difficult because attached tracks might be needed and sometimes they can break. Not terrible, but you just have to watch out for it. Possessables however, do reduce memory overhead when they're not in use because they're put away just like we've discussed earlier. Possessables however, are better for fixed assets that are regularly used throughout all shots. Possessables are not destroyed after the shot completes, unlike spawnables. So global lighting setups should generally remain as possessables, while as shot specific lighting setups can be used as spawnables as we discussed earlier. Finally here are some resource links. You can pause here and copy these locations. These are great resources and assets for you to visit inside this course. Now that's it for this course. I want to say thank you for spending the time with me to take your Unreal training transitioning from legacy production to Unreal Engine.",
