  "text": " So, just to jump into some of the tools that are available to you when you're sculpting your landscape, you can see here we've got the selection of sculpting tools which we saw in the editor on the top left here and you also have different brush types which will give you different patterned effects and you can also change the fall-offs depending on if you want a smooth gradient, a sharper gradient, a more rounded gradient, anything along those lines. Again, it's very intuitive and it's sometimes best to just click the different tools and see what they do and just have a play around there. You can also change the strength of the tool. So, if you want a lighter touch and you want to start adding more details, maybe you want to drag that tool strength down, maybe you just want a really heavy-handed approach and you want to drag that tool strength all the way up. Again, just very intuitive controls just painted into the landscape. The brush size and the brush fall-off are the two properties that we already covered when we originally were sculpting our terrain and then a couple of other good things to point out is this noise tool which just adds a nice bit of variation. You know, instead of having this large flat landscape, it adds a nice bit of just overall noise, I guess, a nice base passive ambience for want of a better phrase to the landscape which will give you some really nice effects. So, we'll do that in a second and then we'll also, when using the sculpting tool, there's a used clay brush which gives you some really nice functionality there which is a good option to play around with if you are molding some landscape yourself and then you can smooth out the landscape. You know, if I go back to this previous tab and we have some harsher edges here, they're not necessarily, they don't feel realistic maybe and we've got some really sharp fall-offs here that we want to smooth out and you can use that smooth tool to just get some really nice rolling landscape. So, let's jump in and do that and just have a quick play around and then we can move on to some more settings. So, I jump into my editor. So, I've got my sculpt tool selected and I've created some hills here. Let's maybe use this noise to begin with and as you can see, because I had my floor underneath, the noise has gone into the floor. So, that creates a nice bit of solid ground there. I think with the noise tool, I'll probably want to ramp this up, ramp the size up just with my brush and just get some nice overall noise that I'm just going to paint in and again, this is why we selected the 15 by 15 gradient, the quads for the landscape, sorry, because you know, we want a realistic amount of space to work with. Obviously, if you're making a larger project, then it'll take longer to sculpt the tool but instantly, you can see us getting some nice variation and again, I'm just moving around my screen by holding right mouse button to pan around to where I want to go and then left and right mouse button held down to go up and down and then I'm just keeping the left mouse button held to pan around. So, hopefully intuitive controls just to get an idea of that and then also we talked about the smooth tool. So, maybe I've got some harsher lines here and I'm going to bring down the brush size using my brackets keys on the keyboard there and I'm just going to smooth out some of these harsher edges that I'm seeing there that don't look as nice as I'd like them to. So again, lots of properties to play around with here. You've got the brush type here. With each different tool you select, you'll get different options. So, when we're in sculpt, you'll see that clay brush that we referenced before. So, I'd definitely have a play around with that clay brush to give you some more organic feeling results but each setting has its relevant set of properties that you may want to play with and just have a play around with creating and sculpting your own landscape and then we'll get going on some more features.",
