  "text": " Hello and welcome to this short video, which is an example of the touch stimulus in action. So here I am back in the engine and I've just moved on to example three's touch stimulus. Now touch stimulus is another example of something that uses the report function in order to function. So if I was to run this now and see that I have my character, from the point that I'd bang into one of the players, it registers it and they will chase after me. So let's have a look at the state tree. State tree is relatively straightforward, much like the other ones. We have two main states that I've chasing or wandering about. And what makes this transition between them is a variable on the AI player, which is registering if it has been touched. So we can see the evaluator is communicating that variable. Now if I open up the AI touch, there's only a little bit of code on here. So what we're doing is we're still using the AI perception updated, but we are checking for the AI sense touch. And if it is the player, we register it as touched and send it to the player. The other element that's important is we're using the event hid in order to report a touch event. And we're carrying across the hit location and the other actor as the other actor. Very straightforward, but it just gives you another example of how you go about using these report touch events. Now if we were to look under the AI perception, you'll see that we have a few other settings that we haven't actually touched on in this. Now we've looked at the hearing, sight and touch, but there's a more advanced if you wanted to go into them, we have the team AI settings. This allows you to react when you come across pawns, which are registered in either the opposing team or your own team. It's still a C++ primarily. We also have the prediction sense config. What this allows us to do is rather than returning a place that the character is, we can look at the speed that they are moving and predict where it will be in a set amount of time and then return that as the result. Meaning that you can send your character to walk to where the character will be rather than where the character is at that time. Meaning it's got a lot more sensible pathfinder. And the damage sense config functions in a very similar way to the touch config. Well, that brings us to the end of our video on touch stimulus. In the next video, we are going to be looking at the actor component stimuli source.",
