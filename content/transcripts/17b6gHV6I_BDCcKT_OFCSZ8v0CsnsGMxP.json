  "text": " Remapping and retargeting will take data from your motion capture performer and allow it to be applied to your target skeleton. The mocap skeleton will often be different from the target model skeleton and remapping and retargeting help transition the data from one skeleton to another. Some mocap software as well as animation software such as MotionBuilder or Maya provide remapping and retargeting tools. Remapping tells the data of one joint to be applied to a target joint. You tell whichever software to have the mocap pelvis drive the target model's pelvis, the first spine joint to drive another spine joint on the target, and so on. Remapping uses FK only, so if you move the chest all the child joints will be influenced as well. In addition to remapping, we have retargeting which uses FK but also adds IK capabilities. This gives you more control over the target skeleton and makes adjustments even easier. IK lets you move a child joint and have it influence the parent joints. Let's say your character is holding a doorknob. With FK, if you need to move the character's chest to the door, once you move the chest, all the child joints are going to move, so the arm and the hand is going to take it off the doorknob. With IK, you could move the chest, then take the hand with IK on, move it and that will pull the forearm and the upper arm. Or with IK you could also constrain the hand to the doorknob and then just move the chest around and the hand will stay in place. Also with retargeting, it takes different proportions into account. So let's say you have a character that is a lot larger than your mocap actor. You can't have the hips constrained, so you need, let's say your mocap actor is smaller than your target character. You could be retargeting or wanting your data on a giant. Retargeting will take into account the difference in proportion, so it will move the pelvis accordingly. If you're walking forward, the giant walking forward will take strides and move the pelvis forward at a correct ratio. That will give you good foot placement and not cause the feet to slide. Your remapping and retargeting are done and you're ready to send your data to Unreal. Epic actually provides a tool that can be used in Maya or MotionBuilder that will allow you to do this. In MotionBuilder, for example, you add the live link device to your scene, tell the IP address to your mocap computer, tell it what IP address to send the data out to, give it the objects to send, and you're ready to go using the data in Unreal. Here in MotionBuilder, we can show examples of remapping and retargeting. So right now we have a basic, pretty much a remapping setup laid out. I have the mocap skeleton, which is yellow, assigned and mapped to this character asset in MotionBuilder. So its hips and so on are mapped into this asset. So Mugu knows what its hips are and other joints. And I also have the target skeleton for the mannequin, which is pink, mapped to this other asset so Mugu also knows where its pelvis and other joints are. And this target character asset is set to be driven from the mocap character asset. So as we scrub, we see the data coming through onto the target. Now remapping typically uses FK. So if we wanted to move the hand forward, we'd have to move probably some other joints to do that. If we go into retargeting, we can use IK as well. So let's say this character is reaching down for a prop. You can see the mocap actor's hand is near the floor, but the proportions are different from him to the mannequin, so the mannequin's hands don't quite reach. With IK, we can move the hand without having to go through its parent joints. So we can use Mugu settings to do this, where we reach the hand out. You see it's not quite getting there, but we can still use more of an IK solution to have the hand pull the chest. So now the hand is driving its parent's joints instead of vice versa. And if we wanted to fix the right arm, we can reach that down as well and add a pull. Another thing to consider is remapping. Often it will constrain the hips, which will work most of the time, but what if you have a large character? Him having his hips constrained would make his feet slide. So what retargeting does, it takes into consideration the proportions and will move the hips accordingly so that way the feet don't slide.",
