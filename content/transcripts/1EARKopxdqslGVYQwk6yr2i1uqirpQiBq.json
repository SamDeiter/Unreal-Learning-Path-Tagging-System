  "text": " In this video, start to look at changing up our sky a little. Now of course we could bring in some volumetric clouds if we wanted to and get this kind of look into our scene. Some moving clouds that actually have geometry and light can actually be occluded passing through them. You can have the effect of an overcast day properly if you want to. Let's use instead one of our HDRIs which will give us a little more control over the exact look of our sky. And we can get that by under place actors searching for HDRI and finding our HDRI backdrop. Notice that by default it wants to actually treat the bottom half of the HDRI as a ground which can look fine if it's centered about here. But then you'll notice if you ever have reason to be peeking above the wall, you have a lot of distortion. So one of the ways we can fix that, if we are concerned about it, is to go to the advanced drop down for our HDRI backdrop and instead choose use camera projection. And now what it does is it treats my game camera wherever I am as the center of that HDRI and creates essentially a sky dome all around the camera. So you lose the distortion but it also makes everything feel much further away which is fine if you're not looking at that ground plane too much and you're mostly seeing everything off in the distance. Now something to be aware of with this HDRI is that it comes with a skylight and Unreal Engine is going to be a little bit upset if I have two skylights in my scene so I might want to delete or deactivate that one. Effects world. Right? And I can bring my HDRI backdrop into my lighting here, maybe even my post process volume and my reflection captures. They're all related even if they're not explicitly lighting. And then you'll see that much like our skylight, our HDRI is starting to affect the lighting of our scene. We could even turn off our sun if we really wanted to focus the lighting of our scene on that HDRI. Though you will notice that you don't get the same kind of hard shadows that an actual directional light will give you. It's more of a general ambient light in the scene. And we can watch it change. We can start to rotate our HDRI and see how the lighting changes. Unchecking effects world does cause us to need to re-bake our lighting though. So if we did want to avoid that, we could have just turned the intensity down to zero instead. And before we do that other light bake to make Unreal Engine happy, one more point about the HDRI backdrop of course is that we can change this to any HDRI. These are the ones that are just default in the engine. But we could of course download our own. There's a website called HDRI Haven I highly recommend that has many free usable backdrops. Each with its own quality of lighting. Okay, and now we can go ahead and bake our lighting. In the next video, we'll explore how we could alternatively use the SunSky Blueprint and then separate all of our lighting out into a new level as we begin to think about having day and night lighting scenarios. See you then.",
