  "text": " Now that we have finished our grass, let's talk about physical materials. Now physical materials allow you to assign different physical properties to various surfaces in your project. And a surface could be anything like a static mesh or in our case we're going to show you how to assign surfaces inside of your material via textures. Now the cool thing about physical materials is they can not only represent things like density or how bouncy something is, but they can also be used to do things like spawn particles or spawn different sounds when a user encounters or interacts with different surfaces. For us what we're going to do is we are just going to make two physical materials. We're going to make one for our dirt and one for our grass. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and do that now. So I'm going to hit control space and I'm just going to right click inside of here. I'm going to go to physics and then we're going to come down here to physical material. Now when I do this I am going to be asked what physical material class I want to base this off of. So we're going to select physical material and click select. We're going to give this a new name of PM underscore dirt. And then instead of doing that again I'm just going to right click on this and duplicate and call this new one grass. And then I'm just going to save both of those. So the next thing that we need to do with this is inside of our material there is a landscape physical material output node. And with this node what we can do is bring it into our graph and then in the details panel we can add as many inputs as we have physical materials that need this. Now one thing to note here we want to try to keep these things as optimized as possible. So if you have five or six materials in your landscape but you really only need two or three of those to actually have physical materials that's the best way to approach this. Remember less is always better when you're dealing with real time applications. So let's go ahead and pop open our material and add this node and get it ready to be set up. So we're going to come over here to our matte landscape. There we go. And then I'm just going to come up here to where my BC dirt and my BC grass are and I'm going to right click and we're going to look for our landscape. And we're going to come down here and look for our landscape physical material outputs. We're going to go ahead and grab that. And then like I said before in the details panel we're going to add one and two elements to this. And if we just come here and scroll down we'll be able to see our PM dirt and our PM grass. Now we are going to get this message that the physical material input is missing. We have it twice because we have two inputs here. So what we're actually going to do with this is we're now going to go to our BC dirt and our BC grass textures and actually plug those right into this physical material output node. It is literally that simple. All we have to do to define which part of our landscape material we want to have this physics or this physics is literally just wire that texture into this respective node. And we will get that. So let's go ahead and do that. Now we're going to pop back over here to the editor and we're just going to take our BC dirt. Whoops. And we're going to take the output of our BC dirt. There we go. And then we're going to do the same thing for our grass. We're just going to plug that in and we're going to hit apply and save. All right. Now in order to check this what we can do is inside of our console we can input the following command landscape dot collision mesh dot show physical material equal or you can say equal to one or one. And what this is going to do is this is actually going to allow us to see the differences where the physical material for one texture is used versus the physical material for another texture. And we can see that right here. So let's go ahead and just pop back in to our editor right here. And in order to do this first off, we're going to hit alt C on the keyboard. And then I'm going to paste this command right in here and press enter. And there we go. That is showing you the difference between those two physical materials. So we can see here one is right here and then the other is right there. And then kind of as they are mixing through this, we are getting different values there. So this wraps it up for this portion of our video tutorial. Thank you.",
