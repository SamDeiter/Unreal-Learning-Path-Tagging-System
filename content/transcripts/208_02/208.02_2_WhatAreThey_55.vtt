00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
So what are these systems and when should we be using them?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.000
So the two systems that we have are the IK rig or

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.679
the full body IK or FBIK that we use within the control rig.

4
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.000
Now the IK rig is designed for a much more simple setup where you can create

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
different solvers and a full body solver, allowing you to make basic changes to

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.400
adjust your character's entire pose based on IK goals.

7
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.399
Using the FBIK within control rig just gives you a greater degree of flexibility.

8
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.399
It gives you access to a lot more settings and

9
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.399
you have a lot more control over things like squashing stretch,

10
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.399
making edits on a per bone basis,

11
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.399
like limiting the movement and rotation of some bones,

12
00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.399
and even setting preferred angles so that the bones are definitely moving in the correct way.

13
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.399
Now these two different systems are using the same solvers under the hood,

14
00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.399
so they're both built upon the same foundation.

15
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.399
The IK rig is useful for making basic changes to your character's pose,

16
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.399
and the full body IK within a control rig gives you essentially a lot more options

17
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.400
to tweak and customize the output of the final pose.

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Now when is it appropriate to actually use a full body IK system?

19
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.400
So the systems are designed for editing your character's existing pose essentially,

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
so they're great for adjusting a pose that you have already,

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400
dynamically, so at runtime in real time.

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
And they're great for things like reaching targets,

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.400
so pulling hands, heads, feet around to reach a given target location,

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
adjusting and aligning so that might be adjusting your spine or tails procedurally

25
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.400
if your character's running in there, they're sort of leaning left and right perhaps.

26
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400
And they're great for ground alignment as well,

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.400
so whenever your character's walking on perhaps like an uneven terrain,

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
it's great for aligning each foot in a different way to the terrain

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
so that things look a bit more natural.

30
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
Something that it's not great for and not designed for

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.400
is generating new poses for your character from scratch.

32
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
So with the body there are just too many degrees of movement

33
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400
then IK solver couldn't guarantee plausible posing

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400
for anything like a human or an animal, anything fairly complex,

35
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
especially when you're moving effectors over great distances.

36
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
If that's something that you're hoping for,

37
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
then you'd be much better to build an actual control rig

38
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
and edit the pose of your character manually

39
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
because the full body IK system isn't designed to do that.
