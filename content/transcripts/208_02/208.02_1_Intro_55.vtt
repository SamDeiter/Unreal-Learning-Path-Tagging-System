00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to the Full Body IK Systems Unreal Engine Training Course.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
This course is going to focus on two different IK assets within the engine, and how you would

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.960
set them both up to give your characters a Full Body IK setup that you could use to

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.240
adjust your character's pose over the top of an existing animation.

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.580
This helps with things like adhering contact points to ground planes, adjusting where a

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
hand might be placed when doing something like pressing a button, and anything else

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.039
where you want to adjust an existing animation to reach an IK goal.

8
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.200
We've included a project in the course content folder, so feel free to download that and

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.640
follow along with the demo steps as we go through the course.

10
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.879
We're going to take a look at what type of IK systems exist in Unreal Engine, and when

11
00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.560
it's appropriate to use each one.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.600
We'll then go over how to create a simple IK setup using the IK Rig asset, and then

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.640
we'll look at a more complex Full Body IK node within a control rig, showing what steps

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.520
it takes to connect the bones to the effectors, and then we'll also look at the bones settings

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.200
to see how we can adjust those to get some better results.
