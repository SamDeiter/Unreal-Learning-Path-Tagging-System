To wrap up the course, you should hopefully now have an understanding of some of the different

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320
IK systems available within Unreal Engine and when it might be appropriate to use each

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.919
one.

4
00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.320
We saw how to create a simple IK rig with our Wolf character at the start, as well as

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.400
the more complex full body IK system within Control Rig, where you have a few more options

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.920
available to you to tweak your final output pose and get your character looking how you

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.760
want.

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.840
So thank you very much for participating with the course and best of luck with your IK

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.359
systems for your own characters.
