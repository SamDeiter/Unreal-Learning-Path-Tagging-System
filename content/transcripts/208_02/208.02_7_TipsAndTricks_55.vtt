The last thing I want to go over before we close out the course are just some

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
tips and tricks to help you tune your solver settings and

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
another way of thinking of how to use the FBI case solver.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So as I previously mentioned, there are a lot of different settings that you can tweak and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
change to adjust the pose of your character and get the solver working how you want.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But to avoid, you know, that parameter hell of tweaking all these different settings and

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
not being sure really what you're affecting anymore.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is the recommended order of tuning your settings.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The first would be to adjust the root settings.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So adjusting that behavior drop down and tweaking the pre and pull root settings.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then work on excluding the bones.

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So removing calculations from the solver and just simplifying things for you.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then you can adjust the pull chain alpha per effector.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So increasing this could help improve your results for more sparse bone chains.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Or decreasing this value could actually help improve results for a bit more of a complex skeleton system.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And remember to add preferred angles to your bones as well.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So these are just determining in which angle your bone should rotate when the AK chain is compressed.

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
These settings should help you fix any issues you have for the most common case scenarios.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But we can still make additional adjustments with some of the bone settings.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So tweaking things like rotation stiffness.

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You can even lock down different axes of a joint if it should only rotate in one direction.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Like a robotic arm for example or anything that should act like a hinge.

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And applying limits to your axes.

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So this should be used a bit more of a last resort as adding too many of these will probably require you to increase the iterations.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Which makes things a little bit more costly.

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And it has the potential to cause some unwanted results as your different settings might start fighting one another.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And another way of thinking about how to use the full body IK solver is actually to use it for a single IK chain.

28
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It doesn't have to be full body all the time.

29
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now you do a slightly different setup for this.

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So in this example with a tail you would set the base of your tail as the root of the solver.

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So tail 01.

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And then within the settings under the root behaviour drop down you would choose pin to input.

33
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And that just means the root will be playing the character's current animation.

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And the solver will be prevented from translating the IK chain around.
