00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
A more recent feature added to the FBIK node within Control Rig is something called sub-chains.

2
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.460
Now, sub-chains are essentially a way to limit the effect an effector has on the whole body,

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.400
and you can do this by defining a small chain of bones within it.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.879
So for example, you could create a sub-chain from the hand to the shoulder, which will

5
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:28.260
essentially leave the rest of the body unaffected until this sub-chain of the hand has reached

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.980
its limit, and then it will engage the rest of the body to pull towards the effector.

7
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.219
So let's take a look at a use case for that with our character.

8
00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.700
Now I'd like to show this off in a more exaggerated way.

9
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.340
So what I've done is I've disconnected our existing logic here with the existing full

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.079
body IK node, and I've created a new one with a much more simple setup.

11
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.200
So we have our right hand in here, and we don't have any bone settings, we're not excluding

12
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.460
any bones.

13
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.740
The only thing I'm going to change is the root behavior and set that to Pinter Input

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.239
just to show this off more clearly.

15
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.420
So when I grab this right hand here, you can see that the whole body from the pelvis to

16
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.260
the wrist is reacting to me pulling this effector around.

17
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.819
Now when I pull the effector closer to the body, you wouldn't naturally lean that way.

18
00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.939
The same as when I lift the effector up or when I lift the wrist up.

19
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.819
You wouldn't expect the body to be reacting like this.

20
00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.140
And so this is what sub chains can help you correct.

21
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.219
So in our chain depth option here, this allows us to count how many bones up the chain we

22
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.780
would like the sub chain to be.

23
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.900
So in our case, a value of two would give us our lower arm and then our up arm.

24
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.340
And the other thing that we need to change to activate sub chains would be the sub iterations

25
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.180
here inside the settings dropdown.

26
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.100
And if we set that somewhere between five and 10, that should give us some pretty decent

27
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.980
results.

28
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.180
So if I select the effector or the hand control here, you'll see that we can now move it towards

29
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.180
the body.

30
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.960
And although it does react a small amount, which is quite nice, it's no longer leaning

31
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.960
all the way over.

32
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.100
And we can also lift it up and move it around within its limitations without affecting the

33
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.819
rest of the body.

34
00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.459
And as soon as we exceed those limitations, you can see that we do engage the rest of

35
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.139
the body.

36
00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.379
And they can be a quite simple setup.

37
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.659
And if we increase this to three, for example, we'll just go slightly higher up the chain

38
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.939
to engage the collarbone.

39
00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.019
And you probably want to set some sort of bone settings limits for this eventually,

40
00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.259
but you can see that as we've added one more bone to the chain depth, it's increased or

41
00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:57.219
it's changed which bones we're affecting.

42
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.379
And this can really help you get some more natural poses out of your character and fix

43
00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.099
any sort of awkwardness that you're getting with the whole body moving when you think

44
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.539
it shouldn't be when you're lifting a hand, for example.
