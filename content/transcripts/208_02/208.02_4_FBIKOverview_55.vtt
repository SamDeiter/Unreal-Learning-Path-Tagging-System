00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Now that we've taken a look at the simple IK rig, we're going to see how the full

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.359
body IK or FB IK within control rig compares, seeing why you'd use this and when it's

3
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.480
a good idea to do so, and we'll cover the steps on how you might set one up for your

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.519
own character.

5
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.600
So what is the full body IK system or FB IK in Unreal Engine?

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.960
Well the concept behind the system is exactly the same as the simple IK rig, so it is designed

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.399
as a procedural adjustment tool, but this time to be used within control rig to give

8
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.960
you an alternative solution for things like ground alignment or arm reaching behaviour.

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.560
And as with the simple IK rig, some of the primary reasons to use FB IK are things like

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.519
maintaining contact, so keeping your feet on the ground or your hands on the table for

11
00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.799
example.

12
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.520
You can also dynamically change the height of your character, so you can force them to

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.359
crouch by lowering the hips while their feet remain planted.

14
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.880
And it's great for reaching a target like with the IK goals in the simple IK rig, adjusting

15
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.760
the hand position for example when pressing a button.

16
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.439
So now that we kind of understand that if it's designed to work in a similar way to

17
00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.600
the simple IK solution, then why would we use this over any of the other IK systems

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.800
in the engine?

19
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.320
Well, there are a few reasons for that.

20
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.199
With the FB IK solution within control rig, you get a greater range of motion and there

21
00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:31.039
are more settings available to you to tune your output pose.

22
00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.000
So when using a single chain IK, if you reach the end of the chain length, the goal can

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.639
no longer be reached and the chain will just lock up.

24
00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:46.199
And when using FB IK you can engage the whole body to move the route and reach those goals.

25
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:51.000
It also has multiple effectors, so there may be times when you need multiple contact points

26
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.599
to be maintained at the same time or even at different times, which may only be possible

27
00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.719
if the solver is allowed to move the route of the character.

28
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.879
And when it comes to the torso or spine of your character, if you're using a single

29
00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:10.159
IK chain, you can't guarantee a great spine pose, so using a full body IK system to engage

30
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.479
the whole body is going to give your character a much better final pose.

31
00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.599
When you're using the FB IK system within control rig, remember that it's something

32
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.239
that is meant to operate on top of your existing animation and not generate something from

33
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.639
scratch, so you can't expect it to fix bad inputs or bad posing.

34
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.639
If your rig scenario doesn't require a full body IK system, do continue to just use single

35
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:40.680
IK chains because there's no sense in having a full body system running if it's not necessary.

36
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.039
And as with any IK setup, don't start with perfectly straight limbs.

37
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.120
Make sure that things like your elbows and your knees have a slight bend in them so that

38
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.200
the IK solver can calculate the default bending direction correctly.

39
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.319
Something to try and avoid as well is to increase the iterations that the solver has performed

40
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.920
to compensate for any bad setup.

41
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.879
Make sure to just take your time adjusting the settings to suit your character, giving

42
00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.800
you the output pose that you want.

43
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.840
And make sure never to pull your character outside of the capsule, because this will

44
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.800
likely end up with your character misaligning from their collision and could cause things

45
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.200
like your character going through walls and other meshes.
