  "text": " Now in this section, we're going to talk about camera control systems and then create a virtual Live Link subject so that we can do it ourselves if you don't have one of these camera control systems. Camera control systems can stream lens data directly into Unreal Engine using any one of the optional peripheral devices that you can pick up from vendors such as Preston's Hand Unit. Now to calculate lens distortion, the lens file asset needs to know both the focal length and focus distance of the lens that's being used. There are several available hardware options that are capable of streaming Fizz data from production cameras to Unreal Engine through a Live Link plugin. The Master Locket, Preston MDR, and the DCS plugin are all viable options, but most vendors should have an optional plugin that you can download from their website and use in conjunction with Unreal Engine. Now, some hardware connects to smart lenses made by Zeiss and Cook. Other devices connect directly to focus systems such as the Preston, and these are commonly used by first ASC's for adjusting or pulling focus and controlling the aperture or iris of the camera. Now, the DCS lens data translator can convert smart lens data in addition to streaming lens data from different focus systems. Additionally, Ari also has a hand focus system and the AriCam Metadata plugin for streaming that Fizz data. Now, this is required using the pre-built 5.0 plugin, and it is up to Ari to determine when this plugin will be updated for 5.1. Additional notes here that you want to be aware of is that distortion of a real lens needs to be emulated by the CG lens to have the same distortion characteristics when adding AR or CG extensions that are not seen in camera view, but are added as a composite later. These distortion parameters will change as the focus is changed during a take, and by streaming the Fizz data, the camera in the Unreal Engine can be updated in real time by the lens file and apply these values to the CG composite elements. If you don't have this, your post team is likely to throw away everything that you've shot and redo this in post. So, if we want to pull our camera control systems for calibration and we want to do this on our own, we're going to need a Live Link virtual subject. So, let's jump over to the Unreal Engine. Now, if you don't have access to peripherals for streaming, a virtual Live Link subject blueprint can be used to manually input focus, aperture, and focal length values with the following steps. To begin, we're going to move over to our calibration folder, and we are going to create a folder for lens files. Let's go New Folder, Lens Files, and inside that folder, we are going to create a new blueprint. So, let's go ahead and right-click here and go to Live Link because we need a virtual subject, so we're going to create a blueprint virtual subject. So, again, right-click, move up to our Live Link, and go to Blueprint Virtual Subject. Now, the role that we're going to choose for this is going to be our Live Link camera role. So, we're going to choose this from our drop-down menu, and go ahead and click OK. Now, this is going to give us our blueprint, which we are going to rename BP for Blueprint, Live Link Virtual Subject, or LLVS, and we're going to give this the Blackmagic Zeiss underscore 25 for our lens name. We want to do that so that we know what subject this is actually controlling with our lens camera combination. Once that's done, we can go ahead and double-click on this to open it up so that we can start building our blueprint. Now, as we get started in here, you are going to want to create a few variables. So, we're going to move up to the upper left-hand corner here, and you're going to see this option called Variables, and I'm going to start with hitting this plus button. My first variable, I'm going to change this type from Boolean to Float, and I'm going to rename this variable the Focus. So, this is the F in our Fizz for Focus. Now, I want to make sure that this is instance editable, so I'm just going to go ahead and click on this little eyeball, and that makes it instance editable. Now, I'm going to need a few more versions of this, so let's go ahead and duplicate this by hitting Ctrl-D, and let's rename this one to Iris, and do Ctrl-D one more time, and let's call this one Zoom. So, now we have Focus, Iris, and Zoom, or as we like to call them for short, Fizz. Now, we need to go into our event graph, and from here, we need to create some event options. So, we're going to start out here with our event on Initialize. We're going to move this up to the corner so we can kind of focus on it. I'm going to drag out from my executable, and I'm going to create a new node, and this one I'm going to type in Update Virtual Subject, and I want to select this subject from my static data. So, I'm going to choose Update Virtual Subject Static Data. Now, with my static data, I do want to hover over my Static Data pin, and I want to right-click on this and split my Structure pin. Splitting my Structure pin is going to give me a number of options to work with, and I want to make sure that these options that I want to work with are enabled. So, the first one I want to enable here is the Static Data is Focal Length Supported. Next, I want to make sure that my Static Data is Aperture Supported, and finally, let's make sure that my Static Data is Focus Distance Supported. Now, I have my virtual subject ready to go, and I need to create a few more options here. So, I'm going to do the same thing over on my event on Update, and in my event on Update, I'm going to drag this out, and I'm going to go ahead and search again for Update Virtual Subject, but I'm going to look this time for my Frame Data. So, in this version, I'm going to, on my Update, choose my Frame Data. Now, just like before, I'm going to move this over, and I'm going to hover over my Frame Data, and I'm going to right-click on this, and I'm going to split this Structure pin. Now, I've split my Structure pin, and I can see that I've got a couple options here, Frame Data Focal Length, Frame Data Aperture, and Frame Data Focus Distance. Now, I'm going to start with my Focus Distance, and what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to drag for my Focus Distance, and I'm going to look for a variable, and that variable is going to end up being my Focus. So, I'm going to get my Focus. My Focus is the variable that I created, so let's go ahead and grab that. Now, I can also drag one of these in. So, let's drag in my Iris, and let's get my Iris, and you can see it's the same kind of node, and I'm going to connect that to my Data Aperture. Now, again, I can always drag this off, and I can always search, so I'm looking for my Zoom, and I can just get my Zoom, and now I have my variables controlling my focal length. So, each of these variables actually grab all of my Focus Distance, my Aperture, and my focal length. Once this is done and assembled, all I really need to do right now is go ahead and hit Compile, and then Save, and that's pretty much it for our Virtual Live Link Subject, Creation. Now, we need to make sure that this subject is accessible, so I'm going to go ahead and close my Blueprint, and you can see I've got my virtual subject in here, and I'm going to move over to the right side of my screen to my Live Link section. If you don't have your Live Link tab, you just go under Window, you can move on down to Virtual Production, and open up this Live Link tab. That'll give you this option here, and now I need to create and add a virtual subject to my source. So, inside my Live Link tab, I'm going to go ahead and hit this Source button, and I'm going to go Add Virtual Subject. I'm going to go ahead and click that button. Now, I need to give myself a virtual subject name, and so I want to make sure that I rename this subject, so I'm going to call this Live Link Virtual Subject, Black Magic Zeiss 25, and that's going to give me my Live Link virtual subject. And then I'm going to choose the virtual subject that we just created, so I'm going to choose the Blueprint that we created here. That's going to allow me to add the subject name, telling me what this is that I'm using, and add that to my source here. Now, you can see I've got my Black Magic subject name in here, and that's going to give me the option to control my focus, iris, and zoom in my Live Link virtual camera. Now, in order to make this work, you'll see over here I've got my NVC camera. I'm going to move up to my outliner and select my camera. With my camera selected, I need to add in a new option. So, let's look at our Details panel. Now, in my Details panel, I should have a tracked object in here, and I don't have my tracking set up just yet, but we're going to need that in order to track our camera for our option. What I'm going to do is I'm going to need to first create my Live Link Fizz data in order to control that. So, hit this Add button, and in my Add button, I'm going to type in Live Link, and you can see I've got two options, Live Link Skeletal Animation and Live Link Controller. So, I'm going to use Controller, and this is the Live Link component controller. So, I'm going to call this ll underscore cc for Live Link component controller, Black Magic underscore zice, and this is my Fizz data, so I'm just going to type Fizz on the end of this. I'm going to hit Enter, and I'm going to choose my subject representation. For this, you can see I've got my Black Magic zice 25. I'm going to choose my camera roll, and this is actually going to control my camera roll. So, now my Fizz data is going to be controlled for my camera, and that's going to actually control and allow me to make those changes so that any of my focus, iris, and zoom are going to be set in here. Now, if you have forgotten how to do a tracked object in here, you just want to make sure that your source is active, and you want to load in a source for your OptiTrack, and then connect that source, and make sure that's set for your preset. That's it for creating your virtual Live Link subject. Next, we're going to talk about one more little tool before we do our lens calibration.",
