  "text": " Okay. So just wanted to go over a part of the course that we just went over, which was the setup of these controls with the finger controls with the sliders. Now, if you recall in the previous section, we made these controls in such a way that now that we are able to use a slider, unfortunately, we're now no longer able to use the control on the actual fingers. So I'm just going to show you a quick setup that will allow you to essentially do both. And it's really straightforward. Essentially, all we're going to do, and I think I mentioned this in the previous video was that we'll create a parent above each one of these controls and we'll have the slider drive the parent so that the child, which is the set of controls that we see now, will be free to actually be edited. So instead of driving the actual control on the fingers, we'll drive a parent. Okay. So in order to do that, what I'm going to do, and I'll start with a pinky just for the sake of speed here, but what I'm going to do is going to right click on each one of these controls. And I'm just going to make just duplicate actually. And I'll just rename these and I'll call them one, just go control and score PA for parent. And I'm just going to quickly do the same for this one. And the same for this one. I'll bring this one all the way up to here. And essentially all we need to do now is change the parenting, right? So the actual control is going to be the child of the parent setup. So to underneath the parent and then pinky or one underneath the parents will have gone all the way down here. So now you can see we've got pinky or one control PA PA and PA and inside of each one of those is the actual child. And inside of each one of those is the actual child. So just to check that this one is actually going to work before we do anything. Let's see what we can do. So we're going to compile just to check that everything's looking good. And the truth is that we don't actually want these controls to be visible because these are going to be the ones that are driven by the slider. So we don't want to get confused while we're selecting things. So we don't really want these to be visible. So turn the visibility off. And then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to run this for loop only on those controls that have underscore PA. So I'm going to grab the name here. I'm going to do a contains. And if the name contains underscore PA as such, now run it through a quick branch so we only execute this on the on the items that are the parents. So now we should be able to as I drag this. Yeah, you can see we've got control on the finger. But then if I actually want to edit and fine tune that control, I still have access to this control right here to do the work I need to do. And then if I go back to the slider, it'll maintain those offsets. So you can see really handy setup, which allows you to essentially do have the best of both worlds. Right. So let's go ahead and do it one more time for one of the other fingers. And then I'll just skip ahead till I've done everything. So let's go ahead. So all we're doing once again is finding a control and you can press control D to duplicate. And then we'll just rename underscore PA and then we'll do the same with this one. Rename underscore PA. And then we'll need to do the same for this one to go all the way to the bottom and call it underscore PA. And now once again, ring one goes underneath that ring two goes underneath that and then ring three goes underneath that. So now we have the ring set up as well. I remember we don't want these to be visible. And one thing I might actually do is I might just change the color to something like green and just to signify that these like really easily for me to see that, you know, that's a different, you know, that's apparent instead of the actual control. And, you know, now they're not visible, so they won't even be an issue. And we're actually trying to animate later down the line. So I can now drive these two with that. And I can also just offset them. Excellent. OK, I just wanted to do the last one with you because just to show you a couple of things that might speed up your workflow. And all I'm going to do is control D to duplicate these just like I did before. But now renaming this is the bit that can be a little bit annoying. So if you just select the ones that are the duplicates, you right click, go to naming, search and replace. You can replace the underscore to an underscore P.A. to make your life a little bit quicker. And then it's just a case of reparenting just like we did before. And if I can find these, I just need to make them invisible and change them to a nice green color. And if I compile this now, we should be able to see that we can now use the slider just like we did before. But with any of these controls, we're also able to make further edits. However, we want. Awesome. I hope you enjoyed it.",
