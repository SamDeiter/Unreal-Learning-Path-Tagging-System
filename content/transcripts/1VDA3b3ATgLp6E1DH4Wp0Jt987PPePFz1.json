  "text": " Hello, and welcome to this video on the theory for Python in Unreal Engine integration. So one of the first important things to understand is how Python integrates within the engine. So you might be aware that Unreal Engine is written in a programming language called C++. Now this is a very powerful programming language which is a little bit difficult to use and requires sort of an external editor and compiling of the code in order to actually go and use. Now there are a couple other options which allow you to code within the editor itself. So the editor being the program that you're probably most used to with Unreal Engine, which allows you to create and package a game. And the first one is Blueprints. And if you're doing this video, I'm hoping by this point you are aware of Blueprints. Well, what they are is exposed C++ code, which you can use in a user-friendly graphical scripting language. This is very powerful and can be used to create entire games. Now in addition to this, we have something called Python. And Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages around the world. It has a more readable markup language and it's very common to find people who work in it. Now this is brilliant for creating tools. Python itself does not compile to runtime. So this is purely used within the editor for sort of toolmaking. But again, what this Python does is it just calls compiled C++. So much like how Blueprints work, where we have compiled C++ that we can just be referencing, Python works in a very similar way. So C++, Blueprints, and Python. Now, if you were to open up C++ and some of the engines compiled, you're going to find that you've got a whole load of different functions and passes and stuff. And some of these will be marked as Blueprint Callable. And this is what allows you to it to be exposed and accessible. Now, the same codes which are marked Blueprint Callable, a lot of them are also automatically exposed and accessible by Python. So as soon as you can see here, we have an example of the spawn actor from object. We can see it in C++, the Blueprints, and the Python code we're looking at. So you can see that the code is actually a little bit more visible. So we are generally working with the same code. Each of these languages have specific strengths. And we're going to go over and we're going to look at Python. So why might you decide to use Python? First case, you prefer coding in Python. There are a lot of people who are much more used to using Python than either of the other different methods. The other very powerful one is it communicates well with other software. So many other software are accessible by Python. And if you're looking at making something that's sort of pipeline-orientated, it's good to be able to talk to each of the systems from the same place. You can also access prewritten libraries of code. So there are numerous libraries of code which are already out there for Python. And by using this method, you're going to be able to use that functionality within Unreal. It's also good for running large tasks without Unreal quitting. So Unreal, if you create something and run it via Blueprints, if it is a very long task, Blueprints may consider it to be hitting an infinite loop. And it will quit out. Now, this isn't true with Python, which is quite useful if you have an incredibly large amount of data to sort through. Last thing you want it to do is go away for a long while and then just quit before finishing. It also is one of the best ways, I think, of manipulating the editor setup itself. So if you want to change and edit how the editor is set up, Python is a really, really strong way to do this. One of the other things that we've used internally quite a lot is it's great for compatibility between UE versions. If you want to go and talk between two different versions of the editor or update stuff, we often use custom Python scripts to do this. And the final method as well is there are a greater number of people who can support Python code rather than C++. It is just a more accessible language. There are more people out there who can do it. So by writing in Python, you have a bigger pool of expertise to call on. So how is Python integrated with the Edge? Well, we have a version of Python which comes installed with the version of the Edge. And that Python version at present is 3.11.8. And the reason this has been selected is because it fits in very well with the standardized VFX pipelines that are out there. Now, this may be updated, but we will update it along with VFX pipelines. Python is often used within virtual production quite a lot because you don't have to have stuff coded at runtime. Within virtual production, everything usually runs within the editor, meaning Python is a lot more accessible. It can be used in a lot more pipe cases. So that's why we have defaulted to that pipeline. However, you are not stuck to use 3.11.8. The only reason that the system is using that is because we have set up by default a tick box on in the plugin for Python that is isolate interpreter environment. And this will be ticked on by default. And while this is ticked on, you are not going to use the environment which is set up on your own personal machine. Now, this is also great because it means that code that is written is going to be compilable and runnable on most different integrations and people who are running. So if you hand somebody an Unreal project, the likelihood is the Python code is going to run because we're standardizing to this Python library. If you untick this box and set your UE underscore Python underscore directory environmental variable, you can choose the Python library that you want to use. So that's the standard Python library that you have. However, we have a specific Unreal Python library. And this is where we will find the exposed Unreal C++ codes. Now, there are a few things that it's worth noting with this. The first thing is, and I'll demonstrate in a minute, but you should be able to find an Unreal Python API online and just search for Unreal Python API, or you can go to the URL here and find the different versions. But feel free to go and have a look at that yourself. We will touch on it when we go into the exercises. However, there's a couple of things that are important to understand. First one is there is no on disk version of this Unreal module. So this means it is entirely created in memory. This is important because it's going to mean a couple of different things. Firstly, you cannot access it if you don't have a version of Unreal running. The most times you will do this, you will run it through Unreal to get hold of the library. It's because it just won't exist. Secondly, it means by default, it isn't going to integrate with an integrated development environment, an IDE. So where you might have an integrated development environment, it's not going to directly be able to pull for it from this. We do have a solution, though. If you want to do something like set up autocomplete in your own IDE, we have a method of generating something that's called a stub file. This can be added to your IDE in order to use that kind of functionality such as autocomplete. If you want to do this, there is an article on our website called setting up autocomplete for Python scripting. It's going to walk you through the process of setting that up. Next up, using external libraries. The chances are you're going to want to use a different external library with Unreal in order to add to its functionality. Now, because we have the isolated environment, we are not necessarily going to have access to all the libraries which you have on your setup. Now, in case that's the situation, what we need is a path so that that library can be found. Now, there are a number of different ways of doing that. In this, for example, I'm showing how I would package up the Python libraries into the Python code directory on my project. Then I'll be able to import them as long as I have the system library path added in. Now, there are some default paths which will come with the system. So, you can have the content slash Python and the subfolders are going to be part of the path. Content Python subfolders in the main Unreal Engine installation will also be. But bear in mind if you're sharing the project, different people might have different installations. Content path also for subfolders in enabled plugins, meaning you can package up libraries with a plugin in order to hand it to somebody. And documents Unreal Engine Python folder. Now, you can actually go into the plugins and add extra paths in or you can add them programmatically like we showed in the previous slide. How to start with, that's all the theory that you're going to need before we jump into the project. There are project files which come with this and I suggest you fire them up and follow along. The expectation is that you carry out the exercises with us. It's also useful as a sort of dumping ground for a whole load of different code that you can play around with. So, I'll see you in the next video when we will be jumping into the project.",
