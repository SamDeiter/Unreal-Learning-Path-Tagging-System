  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to go ahead and take a look at Lightmass baking CPU and GPU. So let's get started. So CPU Lightmass and GPU can be used for baking. We're going to mainly focus here upfront on CPU baking, and both of those are kind of the old school way to be able to bake out your lighting in a scene. Now Lumen will update on the fly because the lights are dynamic and Lumen is dynamic and updates in real time. But when it comes to CPU baking, particularly we and GPU, you have to actually go in here and set up your lights accordingly, bake out your lights, and then you will get the desired look and feel for your scene. Now it's very important. There's several ways that there are several things you need to keep in mind when working with this, and I will point these out. You want to anticipate your needs for sure when it comes to working with your scene ahead of time because baking will take some time, especially if your scene is large. Now GPU baking, GPU Lightmass baking does speed up the process. But again, you have to come in with a strategy and a game plan to be able to actually work a little bit more efficient and say you have to bake on set on immediately. You want to make sure that you know exactly what you need and want, especially if changes are coming in pretty hot and heavy. Now Lumen is a more ideal approach, but again, I want to cover this because there may be some times when you're like, Lumen is doing great, but we just can't seem to get rid of noise in this particular area. And that's when you can lean upon your CPU and GPU baking. So you always want to start low and then go high. And you want to keep things at a medium level when it comes to static lighting level scale. This details gives you details of your lightmass number of indirect your indirect lighting bounces. Keep that low. That's the brightness of your scene overall. Basically your GI kind of how that indirect lighting is bouncing around indirect lighting quality. Try to keep that high if you can. This decreases artifact noise and indirect lighting smoothness. Keep this low. This blurs indirect lighting component in your light map. So again, keeping these things in mind as you work through your process. Now if you're unfamiliar with the baking process, maybe you're new to Unreal and you're more in the Lumen phase. Let me point out where these things can be found. So in my world settings, you'll see that we have a light mass settings area. You'll see light mass as the topic. And from there we would open this up. We see our static lighting level scale. Our scenes pretty small. So we don't have to adjust this too much. There are some darker shadow areas in here that we can clean up with some lights moving nearby. But some of this is caused because of the thickness that does not is not included in some of these rocks. And that can be a little bit tricky. So the same rule and that we came across when it came to Lumen, it's kind of the same process here. We want to make sure we have thick pieces of geo. And you'll notice that I've extruded them in Unreal using the modeling tool. There's a bit of banding and I'm not worried about the UVs on the other side. It's this side where I'm more concerned. Now if you don't do that, you can get these dark areas. And let me show you a little bit up close. So if I go in here and bring in a rec light, any time you bring in a new light, Unreal is going to give you a warning and say, buddy, you really do need to rebuild your lighting. And the two modes for your lights you're going to be in a constant, going to be in constant positioning for is you want to make sure that you set things to either static and that's for objects that don't move and stationary. And that can be for objects that do move in your scene. But again, both lights do not move. The stationary one is a bit more complicated than the static. The static is the cheapest. Stationary is the second to that. And movable is the most expensive since it's dynamic. Stationary allows you to change the intensity of the light and the color and your characters and moving objects to be affected by that light with the shadows updating. So in this light here, we can bring this into our scene. And then we would have to go in here and make it so this light is bouncing around in our environment. And you can see we can remove some of those dark areas simply by moving things around. Now again, you can increase the strength of this light and you can remove some of that. And you can also control your width and height when it comes to your scene in here. And as you do, the energy will kind of be removed from the object as you increase the size because it is again, like a series of point lights inside of a rectangle or square depending on what shape you choose. And it is the most expensive light, but you'll see we're removing some of those dark areas. Some of them may still persist in some regions, but that's a quick way to be able to get that up and running. But again, you want to keep things low when you're working in your scene. So that's one way you can fix it. And you can even bump up the saturation in some areas if it's persistent to maybe cheat some of that or even correct your texturing. But overall, your light map density needs to be of the same level. Well, what does that mean? So if we go to lit here and we go to optimization view modes, we want to go to our light map density here and you can see it in here showing us different resolution types. And you'll notice for teaching purposes, I've actually kept this one a bit high. This could be definitely a lot higher. I should say a bit low. This could definitely be a lot higher so that they have the same resolution between the rocks. So if I went in here, I would want to change this override and make it from a 32 or excuse me, a 62 or 64 and make that a bit higher. You'll see the other one here. He's a 128. So we kind of probably want a 128 here, too. And the reason why we do that is it can prevent some of those dark regions that could occur and blobby areas working with your again, your world settings for your light mass. So let's go back into light mass here. And I just want to give you some quick tips there for those dark regions that may occur. Now, again, indirect lighting quality, we have control here. Keep these numbers low. Initially, you can also control your overall color for your environment. Now, all of these changes that I've just made, including if I chose to maybe change the color of everything, it's going to affect my final bake. When you are baking, make sure that you set your builds to if we go here to production. Now we're in preview. That means a build is going to be pretty quickly. But if we want to see that actual bounce, we want to set that to production. Let's go ahead and go back to the slides. So you also want to take into account what kind of light you're using, like we mentioned before, static versus stationary. Now, if you decide that you need a movable light is moving your scene, you need to make sure that mesh distance fields are active within your project settings. Now, again, you can use CPU light mass for final pixel as well as ICV effects. And you can also use GPU light mass if you need it. But keep in mind that Lumen will probably be your best bet, especially if you want updates on the fly. So keep those things in mind when you're working with Unreal. Now, your volumetric clouds are expensive and will need adjustment for CPU baking for believability. So they will not render accurately at this time with ray tracing. So if you choose that, that is still on the road map. So keep that in mind. So never forget the power of the rec light. That's one reason I showed it to you. It can fill those areas that you need. And that even goes for Lumen, as you saw me do earlier, that will fill that space and give and fake some of the bounce light that we may or may not be getting immediately. So again, you can control on the point lights, your source length and your source radius, as well as your overall view and feel and shape for that with those properties. So let me actually jump into Unreal real quick. So if you do get a hot spot or see this, this is not highly reflective, but if it was, I could go in here and soften that up using my soft source radius. And unfortunately, it can pixelate your shadow. So just be aware of that. I just want to mention that to remember also to when it comes to light mass, make sure you use area shadows for stationary light. So if this is a stationary light and I keep it like this, say I want to use it to maybe fill out some bounce light in here, I would again turn that on and then I would make a fresh build bake in this environment. So here are some pro tips when it comes to using CPU baking. Try to make sure your geo is solid. Now, this is a golden rule working with Unreal as well as Lumen. Having hollowed out pieces of geometry can be tricky. So when intersecting, it makes sense to Unreal. Now, you will see some times where you might see that rule broken. There's like a cafe that I use every once in a while. There's a thin floor. There's a thin walls. It's really made for baking and it works OK. It's not too bad. And there really isn't much light leaking. But as soon as I switch to Lumen, that's where things might be a little weird in some areas and some corners of it because the mesh distance field isn't quite calculated and correctly, especially if I step out of that area or I rotate in such a way that those little thin areas are revealed in some way. The mesh distance field gets a bit confused. You want to keep your light map resolution for intersecting geo, which I mentioned before, the same or at least in the same ballpark. This will prevent any blobby shadows on the seams, any weird light leaking that might be happening. Can't seem to say leaking before the link in the league. What's happening? Frontiers, you can use light mass portals, but can be expensive. So use them deterministically. Now, light mass portals that you heard me mentioned earlier and other classes, light mass portals do not work with GPU light mass. They only work with CPU. They for some reason do not calculate correctly and they're basically put in front of opening of a cave or a window versus interior and an exterior. It's right for that cusp in that area where the values change. And that's what you would use it for. Rec lights were great for interiors as fill lights, but can be expensive. And again, they are point lights over that surface, like a series of point lights. So indirect lighting quality can be increased, but can be expensive with build times. Keep that in mind default, maybe fine and turn off compressed light maps. So you can do that again, inside of your world settings for light mass. And you can turn that compress off right there. Make sure the stationary lights are set to use area shadows. Like I mentioned before also, so don't forget that outside of ICV effects, so you can show to your director different lighting scenarios. Now you can use that level snapshot, but if you have a lot of static lights, it doesn't really work really cleanly. You can cheat a little bit and use a thing called a streaming level node. And we can use a level blueprint, but you can only show off three at a time. So that's a bit of the limitation. So this is again, why Lumens a little bit better. Let me show you a little bit of how that works in engine and you can get an idea of what I'm talking about. So in Unreal, I'm going to go to our class folder. I'm going to go to maps and I'm going to go in here and click on base. Now it's going to ask me to save. I really not saving anything. I'm going to click on base here. I'm going to say, don't save. Now, when I open up this base file, you're going to notice that really not much to write home about. It's pretty much just a dark environment. So what I did, let me click on my drawer and click here. What I did was I created a level blueprint in here. So let's go and open this up. Let's open up our level blueprint. And in this level blueprint, I loaded other scenes that are already baked out the lights. I created a thing called a multi gate. You can also use the sequence if you wanted to. That one works just fine. So that's up to you. If you want to use that, you can see sequence here kind of works about the same way. I just basically use the multi gate, which is used for weapon swapping. So I built this guy in here and a hockey to start it out, created a level switch here, Boolean, put it into the loop. And I used a current level here, which is an integer, and I put it into the start index so it actually knows my intentions. From there, I created a unload stream level and a load stream level. I started out with one of my choice, which is like the day one that I baked out daylighting. And I cycled it through. There's a night one. You load it, you unload it, load it, you unload it. It's really that easy. Load it, unload it, and then make sure that you compile once you get everything in there that you need. I do want to point out, though, as you click on this, you want to make sure you have make visible after load, make visible after load and make visible after load for all of the load streaming. Little nodes that we have here, little sets that we have. So in my multi gate, you notice it's pretty simple level switcher. You make sure you turn on level switch, click on that little node there. And we have current level. You'll notice that's just set by default, but we are using an integer, setting that to that. And then now you've got to make sure you get the names right. That's really super important. So once you get the names right, we can now go in here in our scene. And if I hit play now again, this is why it's not really used for ICV effects because you can't do this with a switchboard set up and so forth. But if you're doing virtual production, this actually works pretty well. I can hit play and click in the environment and hit X and I can load. Hey, there's my kind of nighttime area. Here's my super blue, not sure, just the super blue day planet of blueness. And then we have our daytime in here and I'm just cycling through and we can fly through the environment too, and we can see a comparable of these different environment lighting scenarios. So you only get three and I have a really powerful computer. It's an A6000 thread ripper and I am at my max limit GPU wise, so I can't do a fourth. So just keep that in mind. Let's go back to the slides. So if you're interested, I'll walk you through each one of these. Again, I do recommend level snapshot using Lumen, but this is another one that you can use if you were to use level snapshot. Make sure that you have primarily stationary lights in your environment. Switching between bakes can be a little bit clunky for static lighting, but stationary light seems to work OK with level snapshot, but mostly you want to use that for Lumen. And again, each step is walking you through how these work. That's it for this video. In the next video, we're going to take a look at GPU light mass in detail and how that works. Thanks again.",
