00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.919
Blueprint interfaces are a way to efficiently communicate with various blueprints throughout

2
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.679
your project without having to load the entire blueprint into memory.

3
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.920
Now with our particular project, it's relatively small.

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.920
So this introduction to blueprint interfaces is to do just that and to introduce you to

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.960
blueprint interfaces because as your project grows in complexity, these are going to be

6
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920
very, very important to your project's success.

7
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.320
So to create them, what we do is we come over to the content browser and we right click

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.120
and we look for the blueprint category and then we select our interface.

9
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.480
Inside the interface, it's going to look very familiar to a blueprint graph, but the big

10
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.840
difference is that it's going to say read only across the top here and we're only going

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.200
to be able to actually add inputs and outputs.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.920
But for our case, what we're going to be doing is we're going to create a new blueprint interface

13
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.800
and we are going to add two inputs to it, a score and a time.

14
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.640
And that way we can more easily pass these values around to our interface and our car

15
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.240
and things like that.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.960
So let's pop over to the editor and do this right now.

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.920
So I'm actually going to close this.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.159
I'm going to hit control space and I'm going to navigate up to our content folder.

19
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.280
Right click.

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.680
We're going to go to blueprint and add a blueprint interface.

21
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.560
Now I like to call mine BPI for blueprint interface.

22
00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.719
We're to call this think vehicle.

23
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:33.560
All right.

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.480
And then let's double click on it to open it up.

25
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.600
Now, once you have it open, we have a new function.

26
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.159
So we're going to right click on this and rename it to.

27
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.359
Hicked up objects.

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.359
And then what we're going to do is under our inputs, we're going to add one and two.

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.480
And we're going to call this one score.

30
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.000
We're going to call the other one time.

31
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.159
We also need to change these from Booleans to integer values.

32
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.639
So there we go.

33
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.599
Both sets integers.

34
00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.599
And once we're done, we do need to compile and save.

35
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.960
What we need to do after that is we need to assign this blueprint interface

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.520
to the blueprint we wish to work with.

37
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.520
In our case, that's going to be the BP P sports car.

38
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.680
So what we're going to do is we're going to come back over here to the editor.

39
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.560
We're going to hit control space.

40
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.680
We're going to go look for our blueprints and then we're going to go sports car.

41
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.800
And there's our BP P sports car.

42
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.120
So that's the one that we want right there.

43
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.159
We double click on it to open it up.

44
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.879
And to add a interface, we come over to our class settings

45
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.599
and then under our interfaces, you can see we have this implemented interfaces.

46
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.240
Right now we have no interfaces.

47
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.799
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to add and then from the search,

48
00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.120
we're going to type in BP I and that's going to bring everything down

49
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.560
a little bit easier for us to navigate.

50
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.199
And there's our BP I vehicle.

51
00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:15.000
So we're going to click on that and compile and save.

52
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.960
Now, once we've done that, we are going to now create the following bit of code.

53
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.200
So what we're going to do is event picked up objects.

54
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.159
We're going to get the current score.

55
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760
We're going to set the current score.

56
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.640
And then we're going to cast to our game mode to get the time remaining

57
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040
and then set the time remaining.

58
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.560
And this is going to set up the logic for us to work with our pickups.

59
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840
So to do this, what we're going to do here.

60
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.280
As we're going to come over to our BP sports car, we do need to add some variables.

61
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.560
So we're going to add one and two.

62
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.800
And this first one, we're going to right click and we're going to rename this one

63
00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.439
to current score.

64
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.280
And actually, we don't need the second one right now.

65
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.800
We're actually just going to delete that.

66
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.920
So also need to change our current score to a integer and compile and save

67
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.599
so that we can use it.

68
00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.399
So let's go ahead and just move somewhere off to the side here.

69
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.120
And what we're going to do now is we're going to look for our event picked up.

70
00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.199
And there we go.

71
00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.839
Event picked up objects.

72
00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.079
And what are we going to do with this?

73
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.159
Well, for our, we need to get our current score.

74
00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.039
So we're going to grab this and we're going to go get because we want to get

75
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.159
the current value of that.

76
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.759
So let's set up our score and then our time.

77
00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.560
So we're going to take our score.

78
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.560
We're going to hit the plus sign here.

79
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.679
I'm going to go, you tell these operators add, we're going to add these two together.

80
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.120
All right.

81
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.840
So we want to take our current, our score from the pick up here, and then we want

82
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.319
to add that to our current score.

83
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.959
And then what we want to do is we want to take our current score.

84
00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.800
We're going to bring this out again and we're going to go.

85
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.680
Set current score.

86
00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.840
And what we're basically going to be doing is incrementing our score.

87
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.759
So as our score updates, we're going to take our current score.

88
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.439
We're going to add that to our score value that comes in here and then update

89
00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.480
our current score again.

90
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.040
So basically we're going to iterate on our current score.

91
00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.800
And we're going to do something similar with the time remaining.

92
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.660
So we're going to get game mode because I remember our time is set up inside of our game.

93
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.400
But we could have set the time up in here, but it's better to set the time up inside of the game mode.

94
00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.000
And again, remember our game is very small.

95
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.140
This is just good practice for how things should be built inside of blueprints as your projects grow longer.

96
00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:53.819
So what we're going to do here is from this return value, we are going to cast, not cast, but cast to BPGM Vehicle Basic.

97
00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.159
There we go.

98
00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.060
And we're also going to right click on this and convert this to a pure cast.

99
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.339
Now the difference is that basically pure cast is assuming that we know exactly what we're doing and the values that we are getting.

100
00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.419
It's not going to involve any error checking.

101
00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.560
So we're going to right click on this, convert to a pure cast.

102
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:22.099
And then what we're going to do here is we are going to go time and we are going to get the time remaining.

103
00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:23.139
So there we go.

104
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.419
And then from our time here, what we're going to do is we're going to hit the plus sign.

105
00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.939
So we have an ad operation.

106
00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.199
And basically, again, we're going to do something very similar here.

107
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.779
I'm going to actually double click on this line to add what's known as a redirector to make this a little bit easier for us to see.

108
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:45.539
But we're going to take our from our game mode, we are going to get our time remaining and then we're going to take what the time remaining is.

109
00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.379
And we are going to add that to the time that comes in from our pickup.

110
00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:54.259
And then what we're going to do here is we are going to pull off of this set.

111
00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.579
And we might be able to get this set time.

112
00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.979
Nope.

113
00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.699
What we're going to have to do is pull off of here.

114
00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:05.459
So we're going to pull off of this and we're going to go a set time.

115
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.979
And there we go.

116
00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.739
Set time remaining is the value that we are looking for.

117
00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.899
And what we want to do here is we want to grab from this set and plug in like so.

118
00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.459
And then we want to take the output of this addition and plug this in.

119
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.620
And I'm also going to double click on these lines to clear this up.

120
00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.099
So for some reason, we have this extra node here.

121
00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:26.819
So let's just move that out of the way.

122
00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:27.939
So there we go.

123
00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:29.699
That is what we're looking at.

124
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:35.419
Now, if you need a second or two to get caught up, we're going to pause right here now before we go into the next part.

125
00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.060
Which is a score and time pickup.

126
00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.139
So this is all we have for this part.

127
00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:44.539
And when you are done, you should have something that looks like this.
