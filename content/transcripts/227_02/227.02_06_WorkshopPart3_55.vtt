1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
All right, so now we're going to look at creating the score and time pickup.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.980
This is going to act as the object that we place inside of the world that the user will

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.420
run into and then fire off the different variables or values that we want for our score and our

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.420
time.

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.339
And to do this, what we're going to do is we're first going to create a new blueprint

6
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.140
based off of Actor.

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.300
So let's pop over to the editor now.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
We can close whatever blueprints we have open.

9
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.820
We're going to hit control space and then we're going to navigate up to our content

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.320
folder.

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.340
I'm going to right click and go blueprint class.

12
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.920
And then from the pick parent class, we're going to select our actor and we're going to call

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.740
this one BP underscore pickup.

14
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.219
Now, once we've done that, we're going to go ahead and double click on it to open it up.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.460
And we're going to need to do a few things to this.

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.260
So first off, we're going to need to put two things on this.

17
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.019
We're going to need to put a sphere collision and some type of static mesh.

18
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.739
And the things are going to work like this.

19
00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.060
The sphere collision is what we're going to use to notify our system when the user has

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.379
actually collided with this.

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.939
And the static mesh is going to represent a visual representation of that.

22
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.180
So we have something to look at in the world.

23
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.539
So let's go ahead and set that up now.

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.500
So inside of our pickup, let's go add.

25
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.700
We're going to look for a SPH and we want the sphere collision.

26
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.020
I'm also going to make sure I have it selected when it's added and change its radius here

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.299
to 96.

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.340
And the other thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to add a cube right here.

29
00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:37.980
And that's just going to add a static mesh.

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.900
It's the same as adding a static mesh.

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980
This just does it in one step for us.

32
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.500
So the next thing that we're going to be doing is we're going to take our sphere here.

33
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.540
And one of the cool things about many of the objects that you add inside of blueprints

34
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.060
is if you select them and then you go over to the details panel under events, you're

35
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.620
going to find a whole bunch of different events that you can use to interact with this.

36
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.500
And the event that we want is this on component begin overlap of our sphere collision.

37
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.819
So let's go over to the editor again, select our sphere collision and the details panel.

38
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.100
We're going to come all the way down to the bottom and we're going to look for our on

39
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.379
component begin overlap.

40
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.060
I'm going to press this plus right here.

41
00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.939
And what that's going to do is it's going to bring us over to the event graph and boom,

42
00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.259
right there we have our on component begin overlap sphere.

43
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:40.139
Now the next part of this involves us setting up an interface check and then a branch condition

44
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.900
as well as creating some variables.

45
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.180
So let's take a look at our logic before we set everything up.

46
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.300
What we're going to basically doing is when we overlap this, we are going to look at the

47
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.099
other actor.

48
00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:58.980
So what actor overlap this does that actor implement our vehicle interface or BPI vehicle

49
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.500
interface using the branch condition.

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.180
If it does, then we are going to add a score and a time to our blueprint interface, which

51
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.300
is going to signal our code that we should increment our time and our score.

52
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.939
So let's do this in the editor now.

53
00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.020
So what we're going to do is I'm just going to pull my details panel over a little bit.

54
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.219
So I have a little more real estate.

55
00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.659
So we're going to pull off of this and we're going to look for our branch node.

56
00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.060
It'd help if I spelled that right.

57
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.100
So there we go branch.

58
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.860
There we go.

59
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.659
And then on our other actor, we're going to pull off and we're going to look for does and right

60
00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.939
there under utilities does implement interface.

61
00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.419
We're going to under interface select class, we're going to look for our BPI.

62
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.340
And there we go.

63
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.699
There's our BPI vehicle.

64
00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.259
So that's the interface that we want.

65
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.780
And then we want to take the return value and plug that in right here to our condition.

66
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.259
Okay.

67
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.659
And the next thing that we're going to do is when this is true, we're going to pull off.

68
00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.740
And we're going to look for picked up.

69
00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.219
And there we go class BPI vehicle picked up objects message.

70
00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.699
And now we need to fill in a few things here.

71
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.900
The other actor is the target here, right?

72
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.899
Because that is the actor that is making that request there.

73
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.660
So we need to make sure that that is filled in and then our score and our time.

74
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.980
Here's a little thing that we can do here.

75
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.459
We want to fill these in, but there's two things that we want to do.

76
00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:30.540
We want to turn these to variables, but we also want to expose those variables so that

77
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.819
they can be modified.

78
00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.379
So first off, let's right click on these and go promote to variable and then do the same thing for time.

79
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.139
So now we have a time and a score.

80
00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:48.019
Now to make these variables so that we can modify them when we're placed in the level,

81
00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.339
all we need to do is make sure that the instance editable option is set, or we click on this

82
00:04:52.339 --> 00:05:00.659
little eyeball next to the variables to turn them from private variables into public variables.

83
00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:01.500
So let's do that now.

84
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.139
We'll select time and then we'll come here and we'll do instance editable and then for

85
00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.539
score, we can just come over here and press this little eyeball and it does the exact same thing.

86
00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.500
So if we have both of these selected, we won't be able to do anything.

87
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.459
But again, we can select the time and make it instance editable or public by pressing this eyeball,

88
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.459
or we can select the score and again, instance editable will make this public.

89
00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.860
Now once we're done with that, we do need to compile and save.

90
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.699
And the next and last thing we're going to do is we're going to add this destroy actor.

91
00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.539
So what this does is basically once we run into this, it should destroy this or remove it from the world.

92
00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.060
So let's go ahead and try to add that now.

93
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.300
So we're just going to pull off of our picked up objects.

94
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.579
We're going to look for destroy and there under actor, we have our destroy actor.

95
00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.180
So let's just compile and save.

96
00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:54.620
I'm going to close this.

97
00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.419
And what should happen now is if I bring up my BP pickup here, we're going to hit run and all the way over there.

98
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.460
Now, I'm not going to see any updates, but I should see it disappear.

99
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.860
So if you see it disappear, that is what we want.

100
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.939
We want it to do that disappearing act for us.

101
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.340
That way we can make sure that everything is working.

102
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.860
And what you're seeing me do here now, just a little pro tip is I was really far away.

103
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.620
I'm going to make it a little easier to test that.

104
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.620
Right. So all I did is it just press play.

105
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.620
When I escaped from play, it brings me back over here to where the play was.

106
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.420
So now I'm in that area in the editor and then I just dragged my actor into there to make it a little bit easier.

107
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.780
So, all right, that is it for this section.

108
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:44.019
And our next section, we're going to take a look at adding motion graphics and UI to this using UMG or Unreal motion graphics.
