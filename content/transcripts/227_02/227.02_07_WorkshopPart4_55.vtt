WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Now that we have all of the data set up and our pickup disappears, we need to now make

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.160
sure that we can display that data to our user using Unreal Motion Graphics.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
So the first thing that we're going to be doing is we are going to be creating a user

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.800
widget.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000
So we're going to go to our user interface, we're going to select widget blueprint, and

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.719
then we're going to select the user widget, which will allow us to create a widget blueprint

7
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.359
that we can view on our UI.

8
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.399
So inside of our editor, we're going to hit control space to bring up our content browser,

9
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.679
and then I'm just going to do this in my content folder where my pickup and my blueprint interface

10
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.719
are currently located and just right click, we're going to go to user interface and widget

11
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.599
blueprint.

12
00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:50.039
From our pick parent class, we're going to select user widget, and we're going to call

13
00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:01.000
this user widget underscore UI, and then I'm going to double click on it to open it up.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.879
I might open up offscreen, so let me bring that over here.

15
00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.519
And with our HUD, the first thing we're going to add to it is a canvas panel.

16
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.920
Now a canvas panel allows us to have multiple HUD elements.

17
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.200
If we don't put a canvas panel on there, whatever element we apply is going to take

18
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.159
up the entire widget.

19
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.960
So if we were to put just a button, it would be just a button.

20
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.520
So let's pop over to the editor now, and we're going to look for our canvas panel.

21
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520
There we go.

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
We're just going to drag and drop that right onto our UI like so.

23
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.400
So now we have the ability to add multiple things to this UI.

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.600
So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding a score and a text, sorry, a score

25
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.120
and a time using text.

26
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.960
So this is what we want to add.

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.200
We want to add these two things, and we're going to add some parameters to them as well.

28
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.480
So first off, we're going to come up here to text, and we're going to add that.

29
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.280
And we're going to call this first one.

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.520
We're going to set some things up here.

31
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.240
So let's call this score.

32
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.120
And we're just going to do zero, zero right now just to give us an idea of the size and

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.360
everything like that.

34
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.360
So let's go to our font here.

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.920
We're going to set this to 64.

36
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.319
And I probably should start from the top, but I wanted to get that size there because

37
00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.840
I want this size to content enabled.

38
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.560
And then what we're going to do is we're going to take our position here and we're going

39
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.919
to move this just down a little bit like so.

40
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:28.759
So we'll make these numbers a whole and then we're going to move it over.

41
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.719
We'll say something like maybe like 100.

42
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.719
There we go.

43
00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.400
The other thing we're going to do to this is we're going to put an outline on it of

44
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
say two.

45
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.079
This is just going to make it easier to read.

46
00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.280
So we have our score and then we're going to go right click on that and we're going

47
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.680
to say duplicate and it's going to bring it right up there.

48
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.599
So right off the bat, we're going to call this one time.

49
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.599
There we go.

50
00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.080
And the other thing we're going to do with this is we're going to come here to the anchor

51
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.479
and the anchor defines where this element is anchored on the UI.

52
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.479
And this is really important.

53
00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.639
We'll see in a second here why this is so important.

54
00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:09.039
So if you hold down control and you click over here on the far right hand side one,

55
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.959
it's going to move that time over there.

56
00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.039
And the reason this is so important is if I was to drag on this handle here, notice

57
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:21.199
that the score and the time stay in the same location relative to the UI size.

58
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.719
So this is great because this means that I can make this UI for one setup and then have

59
00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.680
it work on a bunch of different resolutions.

60
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.560
And I can ensure that that information stays exactly where I want it.

61
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.640
So for our time though, it is outside.

62
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.759
So we do need to come here to our position and we're going to move this over just a little

63
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:49.000
bit, maybe something like that will do negative like 390 maybe.

64
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.960
And then we're going to do the position here.

65
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.439
We'll just move this down a little bit.

66
00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.599
I believe this one was at 70.

67
00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.640
So we'll do this one at 70 as well.

68
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
There we go.

69
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640
All right.

70
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.520
So we should have our time and our score.

71
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.600
And the next thing that we're going to do, so we should have something like this, we're

72
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.080
going to create a binding.

73
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.520
Now before I make this binding, there's something I want to mention about binding.

74
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.040
So these are incredibly easy ways to send data to and from your UMG UI elements.

75
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.319
But as your project grows in complexity, the more you use bindings, there is a point where

76
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.280
you're going to start to encounter a performance issue.

77
00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:38.399
There's other ways to get and send data that are a little bit more efficient, but they're

78
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.879
outside of the scope of this tutorial.

79
00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:48.199
So I just want to point out that while this is a very easy and quick and semi efficient

80
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:56.000
way to interact with text with UMG and data, as your project becomes more heavy, you could

81
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.079
encounter an issue in performance by doing this if you have like hundreds of UMG widgets.

82
00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.239
So just keep this in mind.

83
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.800
This is simple and easy, but it does have the drawback that it could introduce some performance

84
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.840
issues as your project grows in complexity.

85
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.519
So what we're going to do is we're going to come over to our score and then under our

86
00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:20.120
content and text, we have this create binding.

87
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.920
So we are going to create a binding that's going to bring us up a little editor here.

88
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.639
And inside of that editor, what we're going to be doing is we're going to do this.

89
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.079
We're going to get to the player pond.

90
00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:35.039
We're going to cast to our sports car because that's where our current score is.

91
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.800
And then we're going to format that text so that we have the score and then the value

92
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.439
here, which we will automatically update from the value of our current score in our car.

93
00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.120
So let's go ahead and do that now.

94
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.719
So what we're going to do is we're going to right click and we're going to look for

95
00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.759
get player pond.

96
00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.079
There we go.

97
00:05:54.079 --> 00:06:02.439
And then from our player pond, we're going to cast to BP and we want our BP, P sports

98
00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.439
car.

99
00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.719
Now we are going to turn this into a pure cast because we know what we are looking for.

100
00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:15.360
So we don't necessarily need to put in any type of error correction or something if this

101
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.360
fails because we know that that value is going to be there.

102
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.279
So we're going to pull off of this and look for our current score.

103
00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.639
And we are going to get the current score.

104
00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.239
And then we need to look for another node here just called format.

105
00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:35.879
And we want this text format text.

106
00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:42.399
And what we're going to do here is go score and then value and make sure that you use

107
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.759
the curly brackets.

108
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.639
And that's going to give you this value right here input.

109
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.679
So we can take that and bring this in like so.

110
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.519
So what's going to happen once we get our UI set up for the other thing is when we just

111
00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:59.120
compile this and we're going to go back to our designer.

112
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.399
So basically when we start the game, when we get some amount of scoring some points, this

113
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.720
is going to update right here.

114
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.920
So we'll see 10 or 50 or whatever the value happens to be.

115
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.840
And for our time, we're going to do something very similar.

116
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.360
We're going to create a binding.

117
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.960
We're going to cast to our game mode this time as our BP game mode, we're going to get

118
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.439
the time remaining.

119
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:28.560
And then we are going to put that into a format text just like we did with the score.

120
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.120
So let's go over here back to our blueprints.

121
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.480
So we're going to go to time and then here create a binding.

122
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480
There we go.

123
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.600
And then we're going to get game mode.

124
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:50.760
And then from our game mode, we are going to cast to BP underscore GM vehicle basic.

125
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760
There we go.

126
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.000
And we are going to right click and convert to pure cast.

127
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.320
And then we're going to pull off of this and we're going to look for the get time remaining.

128
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.560
All right.

129
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:13.439
And then we also want to format text.

130
00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:21.280
And inside of our format text, we want timer and then double brackets value.

131
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.160
And then we're going to take our time remaining and bring that into our value right here and

132
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.000
then our result into the return value.

133
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.720
All right.

134
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.360
And let's just straighten that.

135
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.480
So that's what we have right there.

136
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.680
Let's compile and save.

137
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.879
Okay.

138
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:46.039
And then what we're going to do next is we're going to go over to our event begin play and

139
00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:50.279
we are going to create this user widget and then add it to the viewport.

140
00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.639
And remember that our what we're going to be accessing.

141
00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:57.600
So I'm just going to close off my which is going to come here and we're going to go to

142
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.279
our blueprint and we're going to go to our BP GM vehicle basic.

143
00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.279
Right.

144
00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:09.000
And we're going to go off of this event begin play right here because that's we're going

145
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.500
to basically load our UI and then start our game.

146
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.199
So we're going to pull off of this and we're going to look for create.

147
00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:21.439
W ID, there we go.

148
00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:29.939
Create widget and then the widget that we want to create is our user widget UI.

149
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:37.060
And then we want to add to view the either we go add to viewport.

150
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.380
And what do we want to add to viewport?

151
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.700
Well, we want to add this right here.

152
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.820
All right.

153
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.660
So let's compile and save that.

154
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:55.220
And next up, we're going to talk about some testing and then creating further user widgets.
