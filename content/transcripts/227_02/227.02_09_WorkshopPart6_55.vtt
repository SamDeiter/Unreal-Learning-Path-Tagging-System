1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.259
Alright, with our UI now showing both our time and our score and our pickup working,

2
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.820
what we need to do now is make some menus for what happens when the game ends, as well

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.339
as a new level and a new menu for when you actually open the project.

4
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.740
So when I start, what do we want to have happen?

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.460
And this way we'll have a full game loop.

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.060
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a brand new widget blueprint.

7
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.100
And we're going to add a canvas panel to it like we did before.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.539
But this time we're going to add an image to it, make that image expand across the entire

9
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.739
canvas panel so that we can add a game over screen like this.

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.060
So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor now.

11
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:50.939
And we're going to hit control space.

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.679
And then right here in our content, we're just going to make a new user interface widget

13
00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.119
blueprint based on a user widget.

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.560
I'm going to call it user widget underscore game over.

15
00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.560
All right.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.280
So let's double click on this to open it up.

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.280
And first things first, we do need to add a canvas panel.

18
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.239
So we're going to look for C A N V.

19
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.560
And we're going to look for that canvas panel right there.

20
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.240
So we're going to drag that right over our UW game over.

21
00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.559
Okay.

22
00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.839
And the next thing we're going to look for is a image right there.

23
00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:31.640
So there's the image.

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.799
We're going to bring that down.

25
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.439
Now with our image, let's do a couple of things.

26
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.640
So we're going to go to our anchors here.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.840
We're going to hit control and we're going to select this one right here.

28
00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.519
And the reason we're going to do that, remember, that's going to allow this thing

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.879
to be as big as we need it to be for any UI size.

30
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.959
The other thing we're going to do is we're going to come over here to the color and

31
00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.839
opacity and change this maybe to like some bluish color, something like that.

32
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.599
Okay.

33
00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:04.759
And we need to add a few elements to our canvas over here.

34
00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.039
So what we're going to add is we're going to add some text first.

35
00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:09.319
Okay.

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.680
And then with our text here, we're going to again, size this to content.

37
00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.240
And this first text is going to say game over.

38
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.920
And then we're going to set it to something like 64.

39
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.520
And a couple of things we're going to do here, we're going to take this anchor and

40
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.040
we're going to put it by holding control.

41
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.320
And we're going to go right here in the middle, but we're going to take our

42
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.400
alignment and set this to .5.

43
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.840
And this is going to move our box over.

44
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.000
And this is just going to make it a lot easier for us to position this up, not on

45
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520
the X position, but on the Y position.

46
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.160
So again, all I did is I just took that alignment, put it to .5.

47
00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.919
And then this just makes things a little bit easier to get it kind of centered on

48
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.680
the page there.

49
00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.840
I'm also going to put an outline of maybe like three on this and maybe do the

50
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.639
size to like 96.

51
00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.000
There we go.

52
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.800
So game over.

53
00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.639
And then what we'll do is we will right click on this and we will just duplicate

54
00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.680
it and then we will move this up just a little bit more, not the size.

55
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.319
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.039
We want to grab that game over and we want the Y position here.

57
00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.240
So we just move this up.

58
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.280
And then we will make this say final score.

59
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
And then we'll actually do a little space right there.

60
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.760
All right.

61
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.400
And then the last thing that we're going to do is we're going to add a button here.

62
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.920
So we'll take this button and bring it right down onto the canvas panel.

63
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.520
Make sure it's selected.

64
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.280
And then like we did before with our anchors, we're going to come here.

65
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.200
We're going to hold down control and click so that it's anchored down here at

66
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.480
the bottom of our screen.

67
00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.760
Much like I did with the text, I'm going to take the alignment set to point

68
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.200
five and then this just makes it easier to position this up on the middle right here.

69
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.280
The other thing we're going to do is we're going to take some text here and we're

70
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.560
going to drag it right onto the button and that's going to nest the text in that

71
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.960
button.

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.920
And if we click on with the button selected size to content, we can then have

73
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.200
our text here say something like restart.

74
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.400
And then we'll increase this maybe like 64.

75
00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.879
There we go.

76
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.639
And give it an outline to.

77
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.759
So there we go.

78
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.519
We have our game over our final score and then our restart button, just like we

79
00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.199
have right here.

80
00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.199
And what we're going to do next is we are going to bind some text to our final

81
00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.759
score so that we can have that update when the game is over.

82
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.480
So when the game is over, we'll show this menu screen.

83
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.879
So like we did before, we're going to do the final score.

84
00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.920
We're going to create a binding.

85
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.400
We're going to go to the player pond.

86
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.800
We're going to get cast or BP sports car.

87
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.800
We're going to get the current score and we're going to use that as the value

88
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.439
with our format text for final score and then the value.

89
00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.960
So let's pop back over here to our editor and then our final score.

90
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.920
So that's what we want.

91
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.560
We want to come over to our content text, click on that binding, create binding.

92
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And then we're going to get player pond and it would help if I would spell that

93
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.639
correctly.

94
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.040
There we go.

95
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.439
Get player pond.

96
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.199
And then from our player pond, we are going to cast to BP and we want this cast

97
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.360
to BP sports car.

98
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.399
Remember, we're going to convert this to a pure cast because we know the value

99
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:37.000
that we are getting and we're 100% sure that current get current score is there.

100
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.199
Okay.

101
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.360
And then what we're going to do is we're going to format text.

102
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560
And what are we going to do with this?

103
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.519
Well, we're going to say final score and then X space, two curly brackets and the

104
00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.560
word value.

105
00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:59.199
And this is going to allow us to move this over and then go like this.

106
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.279
So let's compile and save this.

107
00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.360
So again, we're going from our player pond.

108
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.319
We're casting to our BP sports car to get the current score.

109
00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:15.520
And then we're using our format text, putting in our final score.

110
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.439
Remember, double curly brackets for the value so that we can get that current

111
00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.040
score and display that as the final value.

112
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.319
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to select the button that we put

113
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.000
restart on.

114
00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.759
And when we do an on clicked event, that's going to give us an on clicked and

115
00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.399
we're going to use this to basically open up the level that we were in again by

116
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.719
creating this little bit of blueprint code.

117
00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.639
So let's come over to our editor.

118
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.240
So we're going to go back to the designer and then we're going to make

119
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.240
sure that we have our button selected and then all the way down to the bottom

120
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.240
of the details panel, we have our on clicked event.

121
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.519
So on clicked, there we go.

122
00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.319
So we're going to get player controller.

123
00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:04.480
All right.

124
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.839
And then we are going to set and put mode game only.

125
00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.920
And then we're going to open level by name.

126
00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:33.639
And we need to give this a level name of L V L underscore V H I C L E V A S.

127
00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.759
Yes, I see vehicle basic, which is this level right here.

128
00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.000
All right.

129
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.920
So let's make sure we compile and save.

130
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.439
We can close this down.

131
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And now what we need to do is we're going to open up our game mode and remember

132
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.560
our countdown uses a branch so that we can do something on the true and

133
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
something on the false.

134
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.120
So what we're going to be doing is we are going to be doing something on the true.

135
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.079
So when the value equals zero, what are we going to do?

136
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.360
Well, we are going to remove our current UI.

137
00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.680
Then we're going to show the mouse cursor.

138
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.680
We're going to set the input mode to UI only so the player can only interact with

139
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.240
the UI.

140
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.759
We're going to create our game over widget that we just built.

141
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.319
And then we're going to add that to the viewport.

142
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.199
So let's go ahead and do that now.

143
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:32.080
So remember, we need to come over to our blueprints, BP, GM, vehicle, basic

144
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.720
game mode.

145
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.600
And remember, we're going to do this on the true.

146
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:48.600
So we are going to say, remove from and we want remove from removed from parent.

147
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.320
There we go.

148
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.120
And we're going to take this right here.

149
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.840
So we want to remove the current UI.

150
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.720
And then what we're going to do is we're going to go set show mouse cursor to true.

151
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.520
Okay, so we're going to set our current mouse cursor to true.

152
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:14.000
And then we are going to set input mode to UI only.

153
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.520
All right.

154
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.320
And we also need to get player controller.

155
00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:25.520
I'm going to put on my contact sensitivity so that I can get to our game player

156
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.040
controller because we need to tell what player controller we currently want to

157
00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:32.480
enable all of this stuff on.

158
00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.799
So for our set show mouse cursor, the target is going to be our current

159
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:40.360
player controller as well as our set input mode UI only.

160
00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:49.079
Then what we're going to do is we are going to create, create widget.

161
00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.679
And what widget do we want to create?

162
00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:53.480
Well, we want to create our game over.

163
00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:56.000
And who do we want to create that widget for?

164
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.360
Well, we want to create it for our current player controller.

165
00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:03.399
And then we need to add to viewport.

166
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.080
Add to, there we go, add to viewport.

167
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.639
This widget.

168
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:13.360
So if we compile and save this now, what should happen when I press play and the

169
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.800
time gets to zero, well, let me just get a little bit of time here.

170
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.200
And it counts down to zero.

171
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.879
What should happen is we should now see our menu pop up.

172
00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:27.600
And once we do that, once we verify that, we will move on to the next part,

173
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:36.399
which is going to be creating our empty level for our main menu.

174
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.639
So let's press restart and boom, there we go.

175
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.440
We have restarted.

176
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.840
All right.

177
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.159
So perfect.

178
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.759
All right.

179
00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:45.240
What we're going to do now is make a new empty level called main menu.

180
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.920
And we're then going to go to our project settings and our maps and modes and make

181
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.480
sure that our editor startup map and our game default map are set to the start menu.

182
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.560
This way that when we start our game, it's always going to load that map.

183
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.960
We could leave the editor startup map to the default, but in this case, we don't,

184
00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:07.680
we can choose to do that either way, which is great.

185
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.800
So we're going to do a file new level.

186
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.480
I'm going to say empty.

187
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:12.960
All right.

188
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.039
And we're going to save stuff because we've made some changes.

189
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.720
And then we're going to hit control S.

190
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.080
And I'm just going to save this in my content and we're going to call it main menu.

191
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:23.800
Main menu.

192
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.240
There we go.

193
00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.120
All right.

194
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.840
And then we're going to go up to our edit project settings.

195
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.720
I'm going to bring the project settings on screen for you to see here.

196
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.399
We're going to go down to our maps and modes.

197
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.080
And I'm just going to make sure that the game default map is this main menu map

198
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.639
that I made.

199
00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.159
So just change that to main menu.

200
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.159
All right.

201
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.720
Then what we're going to be doing is we're going to create another widget blueprint.

202
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.919
And with this widget blueprint, what we're going to do is we're going to make a

203
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.879
background, some text and a button.

204
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.799
And when we press that button, we're going to make sure we show our mouse cursor.

205
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.360
And then we are going to set the input mode game only.

206
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.360
And then we're going to open our level.

207
00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:16.879
And this works pretty much like we did with the other project.

208
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:24.039
So let's go ahead and come over here to the editor window.

209
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.840
So again, we're going to close this down.

210
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.240
Okay.

211
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.600
I'm going to hit control space and then we're going to come up to our content.

212
00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:40.279
Right click user interface widget blueprint based off of a user widget.

213
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:48.120
I'm going to call it user widget underscore main menu.

214
00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.039
All right.

215
00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.639
And let's double click on this to open it up.

216
00:12:53.759 --> 00:13:00.319
So again, we need our canvas, canvas panel.

217
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.679
We're going to drag that down.

218
00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:04.759
And then we also need an image.

219
00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:09.559
Remember with the image, we're going to hold down control and select the anchor

220
00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:13.759
that is right here on the very, very bottom right to spread that all the way

221
00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:18.519
across the screen, give it some color, maybe something like that.

222
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.120
And then we're going to add some text.

223
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.399
So remember with our text, we're going to select it.

224
00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:28.279
We will say size to content.

225
00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:32.840
We can hit control or click on the anchors.

226
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.360
I'm sorry, press control, bring that to the center and set its offset here by point

227
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.600
five, just to make it easier to align it to the center.

228
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.519
I'm going to say 96 for the text and we'll just call this.

229
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:54.799
Car game, very, very great title there.

230
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.199
Spends a lot of time thinking about it.

231
00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:57.679
We'll just move it down a little bit.

232
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:01.399
And then we need to add a button.

233
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.759
So we're going to add a button.

234
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.639
There we go.

235
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.360
And again, with our button, we're going to come to our anchors.

236
00:14:07.439 --> 00:14:10.360
We're going to hit control to bring it down there.

237
00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.319
And then we're going to offset it by point five.

238
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.600
And then we'll just bring this up on the y-axis somewhere.

239
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.080
There we go.

240
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.240
Like negative 400.

241
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.280
There we go.

242
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.720
Then we're going to put some text inside of it, like so.

243
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.680
There we go.

244
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.760
And we'll size that.

245
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.800
And then we will make that text also say.

246
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.280
Start game.

247
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.320
And we will also give it like some outline.

248
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.760
And go.

249
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.480
Let's also give this guy a little bit of an outline here.

250
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.400
We go car game.

251
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.280
All right.

252
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.840
And then what we want to do is with our button here, we want to on click.

253
00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:00.320
Okay.

254
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.879
And we want to.

255
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.960
We want to set show mouse cursor.

256
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.120
True.

257
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.440
And then we're going to do that for our turn on context sensitivity again,

258
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.320
because it's just cuts down on the clutter.

259
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.040
Get player controller.

260
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:31.960
There we go.

261
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:39.040
And then we are going to set and put mode to a game only.

262
00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:46.159
And then what we're going to do is we are going to open level by name.

263
00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:48.159
And what's the level we're going to open?

264
00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:56.360
Well, it is L V L underscore V E H I C L E V A S.

265
00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:58.120
See.

266
00:15:58.919 --> 00:15:59.599
All right.

267
00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:02.240
So let's just compile and save and recap.

268
00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:06.599
So again, off of our on click, we're going to show our mouse cursor to true.

269
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.840
We're going to set our input mode to the player controller.

270
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.960
We're going to open the level by name.

271
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.159
That's what happens when we do that start game.

272
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.320
So here is the blueprint for that.

273
00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:23.200
What we're going to do now is we are going to open our level blueprint so that when

274
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.560
we start, we can actually show this mouse cursor and load this UI.

275
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.360
And we're also going to change our game mode to game mode override.

276
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.000
If we leave it at the current game mode, what is going to happen is the car will

277
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.200
actually spawn and then we will lose our UI.

278
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.519
So let's go ahead and set all of this up right now.

279
00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:48.639
So we're going to come here.

280
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.720
I can close this for the time being, but we are going to come up to our open level

281
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.320
blueprint and then we can get rid of the event tech because we don't need to do

282
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.200
something every frame.

283
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.000
We just want to do it on event begin play.

284
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.359
So we're going to go create widget and the widget we want to create is our main

285
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:15.480
menu and then we're going to add to viewport like so.

286
00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:16.920
Okay.

287
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.359
Then what we're going to do is we're going to go set show mouse and I'm going to

288
00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.039
disable context sensitivity to find this.

289
00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:28.119
We want to set that mouse cursor true so that the user can actually use their

290
00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:28.599
mouse.

291
00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:34.279
They're going to go get player controller and I'm going to enable my context

292
00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:39.719
sensitivity because I want this game get player controller and we're going to plug

293
00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:42.319
that in to the return value here on our target.

294
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:50.319
And then we are going to set input mode UI only and we are going to put the

295
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.279
player controller into there as well.

296
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.839
And this is going to just allow us to make sure that we're only controlling the UI.

297
00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:03.000
The other thing I'm going to do after I close this is come here to our world

298
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.319
settings and in my game mode override, I'm just going to change this to game mode.

299
00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.759
So what should happen now is when I press play, I will start the game.

300
00:18:11.399 --> 00:18:11.839
Go.

301
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.480
Let me just get some time and a score here.

302
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.720
So we'll wait for just a few, few moments for this to count its way down.

303
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.240
Probably should have picked a shorter time.

304
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.400
It's crazy how long 10 seconds seems to be when you're doing a demo versus when

305
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.160
you are testing.

306
00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:29.559
So there we go.

307
00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:33.880
The time should be over and we should be able to restart and there we go.

308
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.480
There we have it.

309
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.200
So again, we start our game.

310
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.319
We can start the game and then the time will run out and we can restart.

311
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.880
We have something like this.

312
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.000
So one of the other things that you could do to extend this further is on the

313
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.080
restart here, you could actually add a quit or a main menu option.

314
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.920
So you could have a look for the option quit inside of the editor.

315
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.040
There's an option there that will quit your project for you.

316
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.960
You can add that as a bonus.

317
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:10.440
And then you could also restructure the restart code to have something that

318
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.600
takes you to the main menu level so that you can then further refine your project's game loop.
