00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we've gone over Blueprints, we're next going to take a look really quickly at

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.359
Unreal Motion Graphics or UMG to understand more about what it is as we're going to be

3
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:16.240
using this tool with the accompanying workshop.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.039
So what is UMG?

5
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.920
Well UMG or Unreal Motion Graphics is a visual UI authoring tool that can be used to create

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.519
UI elements such as in-game HUDs, menus, or other interface related graphics you wish

7
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.719
to present to your users.

8
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:38.240
You can use UMG to create menus, full screens, or pop-ups, HUDs, and even 3D displays.

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.000
Right here is an image of the UMG editor and the editor itself is actually broken up into

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.679
a couple of different tools.

11
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.679
There's two different tools.

12
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.000
There's the designer which we see right here.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
The designer is broken up into the following little areas here.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.719
Over one, we have the palette.

15
00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.679
This is where we're going to find all of the pre-built UI elements that we want to work

16
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.679
with.

17
00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.480
So the great thing about this is that we can pull in something like a generic button and

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.000
either use the existing imagery or bring in all of our own imagery.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.519
This is really handy because we don't actually have to worry about building code to make

20
00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:20.519
a button.

21
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:25.799
We simply just bring in different common UI elements like buttons and images and sliders

22
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.959
and things like that.

23
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.280
And then we can use those to do things in our UI.

24
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.640
Underneath our palette here, we have our hierarchy which is going to show us the hierarchy

25
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.359
of this UI.

26
00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.359
So if we have a bunch of buttons here, it will show us the buttons.

27
00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.679
And if we have things nested underneath those buttons, it will show us what those items

28
00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:47.679
are.

29
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.120
In the middle, this is going to be our UI preview area.

30
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.120
What we do with our UMG widgets is we bring these common elements in to three right here

31
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.280
and then we can place them around the scene in order to make them more in line with our

32
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
UI needs.

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.719
Finally, or I shouldn't say finally, but next we have four, which is our details panel.

34
00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.960
The details panel is context sensitive.

35
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.599
So that means that based on what we have selected, the details inside of here are going to be

36
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.600
different.

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.040
But this is how we modify the properties of these common elements that we put inside of

38
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.920
our UI right here.

39
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.439
Last but not least is number five, which is our animations.

40
00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.879
This allows us to animate objects.

41
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.840
So if I was to click on this, we'd get a little animation window coming up.

42
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.080
And while we're not going to be utilizing this in today's tutorial, it is nice to know

43
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.440
that we can fully animate all of our UI elements, their positions, but we can also animate their

44
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.200
visibility or we can make them fly up and then get bigger or smaller.

45
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.000
Lots of cool things that we can do with that.

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.720
Now the second part of our tool is called the graph.

47
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.800
So I like to refer to them like this.

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.560
The designer is how we make our UI pretty.

49
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520
The graph is how we make our UI functional.

50
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.600
If you notice that this actually looks very similar to a blueprint, and that's because

51
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.240
you are actually using blueprints to build your UI.

52
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.280
So over here under the my blueprint, this is we're going to find different functions that

53
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.040
we have built or right now we're seeing preexisting functions in there.

54
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
Or we can also override and add variables and things like that.

55
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.200
Two is our details panel.

56
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.800
And again, this is context sensitive.

57
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.840
So based on what we have selected, the details is going to be different.

58
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.520
And then three is our event graph.

59
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.760
This is going to work exactly the same like the event graph does inside of blueprints.

60
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.800
We're going to put down various nodes inside of here.

61
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.480
And then based off of the events that happen when those nodes are clicked on, we will then

62
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480
do things.

63
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.360
So for example, if we were to be inside of our, I'm going to click back to our designer

64
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
here.

65
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.920
Inside of our designer, we could put something like a button here.

66
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.120
And then on that button, we're going to have a little behavior that says on clicked.

67
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.240
And when we press that, we'll see that inside of our event graph here, we'll have a little

68
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.560
on clicked that will allow us to then execute some code.

69
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.920
So this might look overwhelming or a little daunting.

70
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
Do not worry.

71
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.600
You're going to see how easy these tools are to use and how much blueprints and UMG all

72
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600
have together.

73
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.560
And our workshop, which are going to start right after this slide.
