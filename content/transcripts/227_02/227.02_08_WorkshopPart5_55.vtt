00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
Now that we have our UI set up, we need to start doing a little testing to make sure

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.759
that everything is going to work.

3
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.880
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to pull in our little pickup object

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.039
and then we're going to set its score and its time so that when we run our project,

5
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.800
we have a score and a time set up and working.

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.199
So let's go ahead and pop over to the engine now.

7
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.759
All right, and now I have one already setting here, but if I don't have that, we're going

8
00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.560
to hit control space and then what we want is we're going to come up to our content

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.079
and we're going to grab our pickup and we're just going to drop that in here.

10
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.119
Now inside the details panel, again, I should have a score and a time.

11
00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:42.600
So maybe the score is 100 and the time is 10.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.640
And I'm just going to bring this up a little bit.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.159
So let's go ahead and hit play.

14
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.399
So there's our score and our time and there we go.

15
00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.399
And it says timer.

16
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.519
So maybe I should make that say time.

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.400
So we'll just do this really quickly.

18
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.720
If I come over here to my, there we go, that one right there, get text zero.

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.800
We need to go over to the graph, time.

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800
There we go.

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.879
And then let's just compile and save that.

22
00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:17.760
And we're going to close this and then there we go.

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.680
That looks a little bit better.

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.360
So all right, that is working how we wanted it.

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.800
That's looking really, really good.

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.400
All right, so with our testing now completed and our next part, we're going to be taking

27
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.960
a look at creating UMG menu so that we can have a game over menu and some other menus

28
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.040
so that we can make a full game loop with this project.
