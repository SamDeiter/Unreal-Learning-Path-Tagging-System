With everything now set up, we have reached the end of this tutorial series.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now to quickly recap, we first started off by going over some of the more common blueprint nodes we'd be utilizing in the workshop.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We then did the same with Unreal Motion Graphics or UMG.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And inside of the workshop, we took our vehicle template and we set it up so that we could create a score and time pickup

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that then relayed this information to the user while the game was running.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Once the game was over, the user's final score was taken and displayed to them and the user was given the option to run the game another time.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We also created a main menu that allows the user to actually start the project, allowing you to either quit or restart or go back to the main menu depending on what options you have.

8
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It was my great pleasure having you in today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
