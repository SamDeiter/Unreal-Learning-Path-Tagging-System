00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
With the UMG overview and blueprint overview now out of the way, we are ready to get started

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.080
with our workshop.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.540
Now our workshop is going to have the following goals.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.820
It is to create a simple driving game, implement a game time limit, build a reusable pickup

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.019
object and then create UMG display and menus.

6
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.960
So to do this, what we're first going to do is we are going to select a from the Unreal

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.200
project browser, select the games template and we're going to select vehicle.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.240
Make sure the variant is set to none and then we can do something like blueprint UMI UMG.

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.620
Let's go ahead and just pop over here.

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.719
So again, we're coming to our games project here vehicle, no variant and we're just going

11
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.240
to call this like BP U I UMG.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.240
There we go.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.840
And then I'm going to hit create to create this.

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.560
And once that gets created, the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to go

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.679
to our vehicle template blueprints and we're going to look for this BP GM vehicle base.

16
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.100
This is going to the GM stands for game mode and we always want to make sure that whenever

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.400
we are building stuff, we're building it in the right area.

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
So game modes are rules that your game will follow.

19
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.879
So if we were building a tag, we would put the rules for tag inside of our game mode.

20
00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.200
So for us, what we're going to be doing is once we open up this game mode, we're going

21
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.960
to be using this to build our countdown timer.

22
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.120
And this is just good blueprint usage.

23
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.400
So let me pull our project over here.

24
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400
So again, here's our project.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.600
So it should be something like this where we press play.

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
We've got a car is going to go around the circle.

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.600
So that's fantastic.

28
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.560
We're going to come up to our content browser.

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.680
So I hit control space to bring that up and go to our vehicle template blueprint and we

30
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.159
want our BP GM vehicle basic.

31
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.519
Now when that opens up, we aren't actually going to see anything.

32
00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:57.239
We're just going to see our game session and things like that.

33
00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.000
What we want to do here is we want to open in full blueprint editor.

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.359
And what that's going to do is that's going to turn that from a data only blueprint into

35
00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.640
a blueprint that we can edit.

36
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.199
Now with that blueprint editable, we are going to create a timer.

37
00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.519
So what we're going to do is we're going to add an event begin play notes.

38
00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.639
So when we start our game, we're going to first create a timer and we're going to set

39
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.959
it to a time of one second and we're going to have this loop.

40
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.279
And this is basically going to be creating our looping timer.

41
00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:34.119
So as it goes from, you know, whatever 10 down to zero, this is going to help do that.

42
00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.560
So let's pop back over here to the editor now.

43
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.879
So again, we're going to right click and we're going to look for event begin and we want

44
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.679
this event begin play.

45
00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.079
Yep.

46
00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.359
Event begin play.

47
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.680
And when we do that, actually, I'm not going to pull off that just yet because I'm going

48
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.440
to click in here and look for set timer by and we want this set timer by event.

49
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.560
Now we're going to connect these two together.

50
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.280
And with the time we're going to set this to one and we're going to keep this on looping.

51
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
Now the next thing that we need to do is we need to make a custom event.

52
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.080
So we're going to look for a custom and then there's our add custom event.

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.840
And we're going to call it countdown.

54
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm going to take that and bring that right over here.

55
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.920
Now if we were to like do something like this, do a print string, then we go compile and

56
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.280
save, we should get something.

57
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.920
And yes, he's saying hello there.

58
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.640
So that's definitely working.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
And we can see here just to verify if we go here to this game vehicle spawn, we should

60
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.560
see this counting down.

61
00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.439
Every second just printing out hello.

62
00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.000
So that's what we should be having right there.

63
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We could see that working.

64
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.680
So that's that's good start for us.

65
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.920
So I'm going to go ahead and delete that because it is not needed.

66
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.479
But the next thing that we're going to do here is we are going to create a new variable

67
00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.480
called time remaining.

68
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.960
We're going to set it to an integer.

69
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.400
The reason we set it to an integer is because our time is going to be, you know, one, two,

70
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400
three.

71
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.159
We're not necessarily going to have 30.5 seconds or 30.26 seconds.

72
00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.120
So anywhere where we know that we're going to be using integers versus floats, we want

73
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.959
to make sure that we make a variable type that will work with that data appropriately.

74
00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:30.199
So you maybe you're used to just using all floats.

75
00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.199
That's not the best thing to do.

76
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.639
The best thing in our case to do is to make that an integer because again, we know that

77
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.680
we're not going to have any half seconds or quarter seconds.

78
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.439
It's going to be 10 seconds or 15 seconds.

79
00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.079
So let's go over to our editor now.

80
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.560
We're going to come over to our variables.

81
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.039
We're going to add a new one.

82
00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:54.439
We're going to call it time remaining and we are going to set it to an integer.

83
00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.439
There we go.

84
00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.360
And let's just compile this and save.

85
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.919
Now every time we add a variable, we always need to compile in order to give that variable

86
00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.919
a default value.

87
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920
So there we go.

88
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.280
We're going to set this to 10 and let's just compile and save that again.

89
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.360
So what we're going to do next is we're going to pull in that time remaining and then we're

90
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.600
going to use this integer decrement.

91
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:27.520
And basically we're going to check to see when the time remaining is less than zero.

92
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.720
We're going to do something.

93
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.920
If it's not less than zero, we're going to continue to do what we're doing right now,

94
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.080
which is nothing.

95
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.600
So let's go ahead and set this up.

96
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.759
So we're going to come over here and then we're going to take our time remaining and

97
00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.720
we're going to left click and drag and we're going to go get time remaining.

98
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.759
And then we're going to pull off of this countdown custom event and we're going to go minus minus

99
00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.160
and this is going to get our we have a float here, but we want the integer.

100
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.960
So we're going to say decrement int.

101
00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:03.120
And then we're going to plug our to like so.

102
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.359
Then what we're going to do is we're going to pull off of our results here and we're

103
00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:12.879
going to look for less than.

104
00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.319
And then last, we're going to get a branch.

105
00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.879
Now we can add this branch a couple of different ways.

106
00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.599
We can pull out of here and look for a branch.

107
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.920
Here's the branch right there.

108
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.040
Or if you want, you can hold down the B key and you will add a branch as well.

109
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.760
That's usually the way that I add branches by holding down the B key.

110
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.760
So that is going to make up the first part of this.

111
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.840
And now what we're going to do in the next section is we're going to take a look at blueprint

112
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.920
interfaces as they are a great way to cheaply and efficiently send data back and forth between

113
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.240
multiple blueprints.
