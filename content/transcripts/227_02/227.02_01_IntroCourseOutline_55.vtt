Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with Epic Games.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the following video tutorial series, we're going to take a look at creating user interfaces using UMG and Blueprints.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to do this by first taking an overview look at Blueprints to make sure that everyone who's following this video tutorial series understands some basic Blueprint concepts that we'll be using throughout this project.

4
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're then going to take a look at Unreal Motion Graphics or UMG to familiarize ourselves with the editor and what it's used for so that when we use it in our workshop, it'll make a little more sense.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Speaking of our workshop, what we're going to be doing after we go over our Blueprint overview and the overview of UMG is we're going to be using the vehicle template to create a game that involves pickups and writing things to the HUD,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as well as a menu system so that we will complete a complete game loop including a start level with a clickable UI that allows us to start the game.

7
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Once we're inside the game, we'll update our UI so that we can see things like time as well as score and all of the various components that we'll need to make in order for this to happen.

8
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we've got a lot in store for this video tutorial series and let's now start with our Blueprint overview.
