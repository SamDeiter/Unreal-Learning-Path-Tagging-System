00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Before we go further, I'd like for us to have a quick blueprint overview so that we can make

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.599
sure that everyone understands a few of the blueprint concepts we're going to be making

3
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.600
heavy use of inside of our example. Now the first one is understanding blueprint flow.

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.960
Now this is a term that's used to describe how the blueprint graph goes from left to right,

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.719
just like you read in English. So no matter what we're doing, we're always going to be

6
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:32.600
starting at the left hand side. So we'll start here, and then we will go to the right, process

7
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.239
our output, and then we will be able to choose something here at the end. But it's very important

8
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.519
to understand this because this is going to happen a lot inside of our projects. Now there are some

9
00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.960
nodes that we will be looking at using as well as some additional nodes here that I just want to

10
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.519
call out. But first off is the node I want to talk about here is the branch. And the branch

11
00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.640
allows us to do things on a true or a false. And this is unreal. If then node. So if something is

12
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.840
true, we're going to do this. If something is false, we're going to do this. Notice the condition

13
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840
here, this allows us to tie this to a variable. So we can have a bunch of different variables,

14
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.079
one that looks for something like, you know, the player has the key. And if they do, then we will

15
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.600
open the door. If not, we'll give them a message that says, you know, you don't have the key. There's

16
00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:26.119
a lot of things that we can do with this one simple branch node, in terms of flow controller,

17
00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.000
how our project is going to progress from one area to another. Next, we have a flip flop. So the

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.039
flip flop allows us to have something input here. And then what's going to happen is it's going to go

19
00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.759
a and then B, and it's going to repeat this behavior for the entire way the project is running. So

20
00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.039
I like these because we can put these on a button. And if we click the button, it's going to do

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.480
something like turn on the light. And then if we click it again, it will turn off the light

22
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.480
without us having to develop a really complicated trigger to you know, is it been turned on? Yes,

23
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.719
then we reset something. This is just really did we turn it on? Toggle a, did we toggle again,

24
00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:12.520
then toggle B? After that, we have a sequence. Now a sequence allows us to execute a sequence

25
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.759
of events based off of an input. If we want, we can use this add pin here to add more than inputs,

26
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:26.840
or I should say then outputs and fire off as many things as we want. Next to that, we have a

27
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.159
switch on int. This allows us to add again, additional outputs here, but instead of just

28
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:41.000
firing them off in succession, this like the sequence node, this allows us to enter an integer

29
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.359
here that will execute that particular output that we have. So if we put a zero, it's going to do

30
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.840
default. If we were to add a pen here and do one, it will do the next one to the next one,

31
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.760
and so on, and so on. Last but not least, we have gate and multi gate net. While we won't be making

32
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.920
use of these nodes in this project, it's just something I wanted to call out, because these do

33
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.400
allow us to do some very complex flow control gates allow us to do actually execution based

34
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.599
conditional checks so we can check for have things been entered into or states and things of that

35
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.960
nature using these. And again, while we don't necessarily utilize them in this particular

36
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:34.360
tutorial, it is good to know about them. Now, this slide deals with time control, because flow control

37
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.280
is again, how our project is going to deal with data time control is how our project is going to be

38
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.159
dealing with times and turn off things like maybe a countdown for a level, or maybe you're keeping

39
00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.159
time to do a time trial or some other nature, but time control is very important. And the first

40
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.560
thing that we can do to control time with our delays. Now, there is a delay, a delay in delay

41
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.840
until the next tick and a retrogable delay. Now, while delays are great when you're prototyping,

42
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.560
the problem with any of these delays is that once you have started the delay, there is no way to stop

43
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.959
it or restart it or go around it. A delay, if you say, let me put a delay in the five seconds,

44
00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:27.160
there is no way to stop that delay from happening, you have to wait for the full five seconds, so

45
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.920
you can't say interrupt it. Now, if you want something that you could interrupt or something

46
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.000
that's just a lot easier to keep time with, there are actual two nodes called set timer by event and

47
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.879
set timer by function name, but we're actually going to be utilizing these in our code here to

48
00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:50.840
create a timer for our example in a little bit. But these timer nodes are really cool because

49
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.639
you can set multiple timers for whatever you need. And then anywhere through blueprint,

50
00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.280
you can actually call the timer and stop it or start it. So they're extremely useful.

51
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.799
The last thing that I want to talk about is a timeline. So a timeline allows us to

52
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:16.199
animate between two values. So let's say we wanted to go between zero and one, we can use a timeline

53
00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:25.079
to animate that going from zero to one. The last thing that I want to talk about here is with a

54
00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:30.759
delay, just a little pro tip. If you set the duration down here to zero, that's actually going

55
00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.599
to give you a one frame delay. And that's actually one of the best use cases for a delay is if you

56
00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.759
are trying to act as a single frame delay, you can set it to point zero, and it will act as a

57
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:49.560
single frame delay. And this is great if you need to slow spawning down or delay something just by

58
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.799
a single frame until something else happens. This can be a really great way to do that inside of

59
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800
blueprints.
