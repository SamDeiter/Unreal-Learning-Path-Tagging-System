  "text": " The next thing that we'll do is add roughness. Roughness we can either go with parameter 2D or texture sampler. Let's go with a. Let's go with a. Let's pull down the T key and. Left click on the grid and we're going to texture sample which may actually convert as we proceed to parameter 2D. And for this. And for this. This is going to be our roughness, so let's look for a texture that. represents roughness for now let's see it let's see what happens when we start typing in roughness. Rough roughness this will work. That's good. We'll promote this to a parameter. And call it roughness. And you may recall that roughness like metal this goes from zero to one. So we'll want to create a. An intensity parameter so we'll hold down the S key and. Left click to get this to create a scalar parameter for roughness, which we'll call roughness intensity. We'll use a multiply node to bring these together. Hold down the M key left click. And feed the RGB into the. A channel and roughness into the B channel. And pipe that into roughness. We do have a kind of crossing of streams, but that's okay. So this is part of the roughness group. Well, actually it isn't part of the roughness group let's create a roughness group, so that the map and the scalar are together. And we can set the, we could set this to one as a default value. Doesn't really matter we can change it later. This is really just for, again, everything you see here is really just a placeholder for the tool that we're creating, you can change any of these and save them. And they'll be part of the. Sort of master material apparent material that you're creating. And the last thing we'll create among our major attributes for this material are is a normal. And so for that we'll add a. Hold down the T key and get the texture sample which when we promote it to a parameter will change it, and we'll find a normal map for this by going to this nodes details and going to the drop down and typing normal. And let's see. We have a lot of normal. This is a good one. This will just help us remember what this is for. Not that it has to remain. We'll want a scalar intensity for this. Hold down the S key left click. And let's make this a normal intensity. Almost seems like, like an oxymoron. If you're normal you're not intense. And to combine these you may recall that the best way to combine these is not with a, an ad or a multiply or our new blend overlay but are flatten normal node created specifically a material function created specifically to handle normals flatten flatten normal. And in a bit of oddness. It wasn't really created for artists, and it has this node ends up flipping the values of scalar parameters. So, to understand that say zero would be off and one would be on. We need to flip the values before they're fed into this which will flip the values again. And so we need a one minus node, or, or minus one. If you hold down the O for one minus, hold down the O key and left click you get a minus one node. And we can take our normal intensity and feed it into our minus one or one minus, and take that result and pipe it into our flatness, take the RGB of our texture map and feed that into our normal. Now we need to actually need to expose the parameters. Convert this to parameter I should say. And let's call this normal. We've already named this. And let's create a group for these individually. I thought you might be able to get away with doing them together but we couldn't. We'll call this normal and choose our scalar parameter and add that to our normal group. Then we'll take the output from our flatten normal and feed it into normals. And this is the basics for a parent material that includes the sort of most frequently used attributes of, of really almost any material albedo metal rough and normal. So we have a few things available and if you change the domain of, of a result node you could add more in but this is generally speaking a really good solid starting point. What we don't have though is, we don't have a way of controlling the UVs. So we'll want to build that in, which we'll do over on the left where we have some room. So, UVs if you're not familiar with the concept of UVs. Let me try to explain it briefly. So this is a very understanding 3D systems with the axis over here in the viewport x, y and z over here on the bottom left of the viewport. So this handles the coordinates of 3D objects and allows us to understand how to move through space, how to track it, how to control it. So UVs also occupy space but they don't really occupy 3D space. They occupy 2D space. So, we needed a different system for a different way of describing space for 2D textures. And because x, y and z were taken for 3D. So we just use the letters before x, y and z, u and v, to help us understand, organize and control 2D space. Hence, UV. Now UV, the value of UV is and controlling texture space is when you apply a material to an object. It takes that material and basically wraps it around that material in a zero to one fashion. Say, zero here, one here. It takes place to be able to control whether it wraps all the way around, whether it repeats, whether, and whether it can be tiled. And having control over the UVs gives you all of that kind of control. So let's put together a system over here for controlling the UVs. So we need access to the texture coordinates to the u's and the v's. And for that, we'll hold down the u key to get at the texture coordinates or you could do a search in the search bar here. But we'll hold down the u key and click on the grid to bring up texture coordinates. So this is a kind of function input that gets us access to the u's and the v's. To control the tiling and the u and the v, we'll need scalar parameters down here. So if we hold down the s key and left click, we get a scalar parameter which we can call tiling. And if we And we can set the, what do we want to do? I want to set the default value to one so that it comes into play as soon as it's used. And so it wraps at one. And I want to make another scalar parameter for the u and the v as offsets. And so with tiling selected, I'll use Ctrl W to copy it and then move my cursor below it, Ctrl W again to copy it again. And I'll just change the name of this second scalar parameter to offset u. I'll copy the name. And then select the bottom one and paste the name into its parameter name and change the u to v. Then we'll tie these nodes together with a multiply at the top. And then type the m key and type your texture coordinates into a, and you're tiling into b. Then for u and v, we will append those values with an append node. And then for append vector we can pipe the offset u into a and the offset v into b. Then we can take the results of these two nodes and multiply them. Hold down the m key, left click for this multiply, and then pipe the value of the coordinates and tiling into a and the appended u and v into b. Lastly, take the results of this multiply and the system that we've built and pipe it into each of the textures u's and v's. So no matter what maps we use in our material or our material instance we'll have control over the u's and the v's, the tiling and the repeats. And they'll all be in lockstep with one another. Pretty good. A lot more control than we've had in other materials. We'll apply this by going to the toolbar and hitting apply. And we'll save. Drag this window away. And if we go to our in class material folder here, in class material. We've saved our m new parent. So to show you the toolness that we've built, and how you get it that something that we saw earlier. We'll create a material instance of this new parent by right clicking on the parent and going to the top and say, calling it, calling up a material instance create material instance. And we'll call this. We'll take instance off the end. And we'll call it mi for material instance new parent. Or we could call it child. Let's call it child. By double clicking on this. It will open in our editing window. Let's zoom out a little bit. Make this full screen. And we have our material instance our first material instance. Here, and on the right in the details we have access to all these controls. Oh, we don't have access to all the controls for missing. We're missing the UV controls because I forgot to make them parameters. Make them available and put them in a group. Actually, are they there, I think they are. They're not really there. They're, they are there but they're floating. Let's add them to, to a group so that they're better organized. Let's call it UV coordinates. That'll be much easier to understand. And now in our child. We have UV coordinates. So if we turn these on, we can turn, let's turn everything on. We can see that all of these can be can now be adjusted. We can swap out this albedo map for another one. This normal map for another one. The roughness map, etc. We can adjust the albedo tint by clicking on the on the tint color chip and just choosing another color matching something that's part of our project. It isn't tinted because the tint intensities at zero but if we raise it. We can adjust the look of our material. We can change the specular intensity to make it more specularly reflective or less so. If you're lost, you can use the reset to default or save your butt arrow. Little yellow arrow at the end of the value setter. We can change the normal intensity. We can change the roughness intensity, making it shiny or less shiny, metallic key. And we can also change the tiling. We can also change the u, say how much it's stretching or repeating along the horizontal, or the V. So, a lot more control. Let's set these to the default. And we also have this switch controller. And as we said, we're using a base metal so we're just using a single value to control the metalness of it. And we see that in the top left underneath the controls of the viewport, there are there's information about the material in use and we can see that this light map is using 214 instructions. But if we change our switch in the details if we turn on the map that we used and its intensity slider. We'll see that we have another map available to us that we can switch out and a different controller for the intensity. So, if we set turn this on. We now have access to these controls. We have to turn them on individually. The metal this map and the metal intensity. And now we can switch out the map and adjust the intensity, based on this controller. We had 214 instructions as part of our material previously, but now, with this switch turned on. We have 215 instructions. Now, this is a slight change in the current example. So, if you have hundreds of materials in your project. The number of instructions can add up and can affect the performance of your scene. So this is just a great way of creating a robust material and creating children that you could swap out and make into say, wood textures leather textures and you'd have all of these controls built in to your to your child based on what we did in the parent material. All at all. Terrific and and powerful.",
