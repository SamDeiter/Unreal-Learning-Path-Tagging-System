  "text": " Hi, my name is Sean Spitzer, Senior Instructor for Epic Games. Today we're going to be talking about Introduction to Materials. Some of the things that we'll be handling in this first section, we'll be looking at real-time material concepts. What materials are in Unreal and what is a PBR? Later on, we'll look at primary textures, nodes and textures, primary PBR inputs, material settings and textures overall. Material editor and parent materials we'll look at later and look at the material editor overview, some hotkeys to keep in mind, your preview window and what it can do for you, the material system as a whole, blend and light modes using that in Unreal, and parent material instances. Making materials and parameters also we will cover and editing materials. Later we'll look at animating materials, diffuse and spec setup, pattern node blending, rough setup, normal setup, AO setup, and cloth material as a whole and how that works using a shading model for cloth and setting up the cloth. In each section, I'll point out some tips and tricks and things you have to keep in mind when working with materials. So let's go ahead and get started on this first half. We're now going to look at real-time material concepts. So many will ask what is a material in this real-time environment? It is essentially an asset applied to a mesh to control its visual look. In its simplest form, you can think of it as paint with various properties such as color and finish. In Unreal, we can control that color and we can control that finish. A material defines how light interacts with the surface it is applied to. Now you can see a graphic down below here showing how there can be some absorbance in your material based on its color information and roughness values. And there can be some refraction also based on its color and how much roughness may be in there or not in there. What is a PBR? Many will ask. Well, to break it down simply, it's a unified lighting and shading system. It's a better approximation of light and materials physical interaction. It's intuitive and consistent, physically accurate, uses real-world physical measurements. And PBR is a combination of the materials, the lighting, and the exposure. And you can see there's many factors at play in Unreal. And Unreal tries to give you the most realistic environment to be able to build these materials. And that's what makes Unreal a great real-time engine to work with. That's it for this section. And in the next section, we're going to take a look at the primary nodes and textures.",
