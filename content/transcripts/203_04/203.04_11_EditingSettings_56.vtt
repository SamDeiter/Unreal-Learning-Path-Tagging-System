1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Path Tracer and Unreal Engine uses an approximation for caustic lighting.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The complex light patterns created when light reflects or

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
refracts off of shiny or transparent surfaces like glass or metal.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
True caustics are physically accurate, but very noisy and slow to converge,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
especially on materials with low roughness,

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that have like smooth or mirror-like surfaces.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They can take an impractical number of samples to render correctly.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
To keep images smooth and reduce noise, Unreal's Path Tracer automatically

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
enables an approximation that simplifies the caustic calculations

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
instead of fully simulating them.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is controlled by the console command r.pathtracing.approximateCaustics

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and setting the value, the default being 1, and it's on by default.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When working with caustics in Path Tracer, it's important to know the difference

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
between refractive and approximate caustics.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Using the denoiser lets you preview what true refractive caustics would look like

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if the renderer had enough time to fully converge,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
showing you the physically accurate results.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In contrast, approximate caustics generate a production-ready image much faster,

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
using a simplified model that greatly reduces noise.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You can toggle this feature on with the console command r.pathtracing.approximateCaustics

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and using 1 or 0 to enable or disable respectively.

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Finally, here are some CVars commonly used to modify path tracing

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and path tracing results within Unreal Engine.

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In the next section, we're going to cover using skylights, particularly with Path Tracer.
