00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Welcome to the Path Tracer class for Unreal Engine 5.6.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.180
In this class, we'll explore how to set up and use Path Tracer, adjust key CVars to improve

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.120
visual fidelity, and author or adapt materials for high-quality offline rendering.

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.720
We'll also cover how to leverage post-processed material buffers for fine-tuning results and

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720
enhancing realism.

6
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.760
From there, we'll look at proven techniques to reduce visual artifacts along with the

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.400
best practices for tweaking rendering and lighting settings to achieve true cinematic

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.880
quality.

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.200
And to wrap things up, we'll share a few pro tips and advanced considerations for maintaining

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
optimal performance and control when working with Unreal's Path Tracing system.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Let's get started.
