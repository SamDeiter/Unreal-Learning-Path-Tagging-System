00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Path tracing produces physically accurate lighting but can suffer from sampling noise

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.100
and convergence artifacts, especially with limited samples or complex materials.

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.660
Reducing these artifacts improves image quality, stability, and realism without necessarily

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.760
increasing render times dramatically.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680
Our two primary means of reducing noise and increasing visual output is through sample

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.940
count and denoising.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.980
Fireflies are isolated, overly bright pixels that appear as tiny white or colored specks

8
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.980
in a path tracing image.

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.820
They usually show up in reflections, refractions, or glossy surfaces, and flicker or sparkle

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.500
between frames.

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.420
You can think of them as render noise spikes caused by a rare but extremely high energy

12
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060
light sample.

13
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.100
While path tracing attempts to minimize the most common sources of these effects, they

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
can still occur in some scenarios.

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.860
One of the most common methods for controlling the quality of path tracing is through a post-processing

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.180
volume.

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.660
Under the path tracing rollup, there are various parameters we can adjust to control the balance

18
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.500
between performance and visual quality.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.660
Note, the parameters in our post-processing volume, as well as several others, can still

20
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.900
be controlled through CVARs.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.780
This is a great way for us to lower the quality of path tracing for real-time editor performance

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.700
but still increase the visual quality using those CVAR parameter overrides when using

23
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.220
Movie Render Queue.

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.060
Speaking of Movie Render Queue, even with high sample counts, Path Tracer will always

25
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.080
have a bit of residual noise in the rendered frame.

26
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.320
By using the denoiser option in the post-processing volume, Unreal will utilize Intel's Open Image

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.620
Denoise library to remove the noise from the last sample.

28
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.260
The denoise option is near the bottom of the path tracing rollup within the post-processing

29
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.260
volume.

30
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.060
To enable it, simply check both boxes and it should be on.

31
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.340
Finally, on-screen are the current denoising algorithms implemented by Path Tracer through

32
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.340
various plugins within Unreal Engine.

33
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.380
Included in the slides are links to the various support docs that go deeper into using these

34
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.960
denoisers.

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.480
In the next section, we're going to cover editing some of our settings for Path Tracer.
