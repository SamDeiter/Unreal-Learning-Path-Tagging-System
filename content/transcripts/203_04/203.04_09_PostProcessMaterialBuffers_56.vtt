00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
When using Path Tracer, post-processed material buffers exist to let artists and TDs access

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
and manipulate the raw render data generated by Path Tracer after it's computed lighting,

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.420
shading, and ray interactions, but before tone mapping and final composition.

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.000
Selecting from the Path Tracing Buffer Texture node's dropdown settings, we have a few options

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720
for changing the buffer texture.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.520
This displays the full Path Trace lighting results, including all light interactions.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.640
Denoise Radiance shows the lighting results after the denoise smooths out noise.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.400
Albedo displays the pure material color, independent of light or shadow.

9
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.680
Normal shows the surface direction information that affects shading and denoising.

10
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.800
And finally, Variance highlights where the Path Tracer's noise or sampling instability

11
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
is at its highest.

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.480
In the next section, we're going to talk about reducing artifacts.
