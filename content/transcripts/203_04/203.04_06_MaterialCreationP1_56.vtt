00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first material we're going to create is a simple thin glass material.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm gonna navigate to my content drawer and in the lighting 203 for our T folder,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.760
I'm just gonna create a new folder and just call it examples.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.480
We'll double click and open that folder and

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm going to right click and create a new material.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
And we'll just name this M underscore thin glass.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.120
Go ahead and double click it and it will open our material editor.

8
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.480
Now from here, I want to adjust a few base settings of the material

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.000
to allow it to work properly with path tracer.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.320
So the first thing I'm gonna do is change my blend mode to translucent and

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.680
change my shading model from default lit to thin translucent.

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.960
Now we will see a couple warnings and this indicates the third step we need to do,

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.720
which is change our lighting mode to surface forward shading.

14
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.840
So we can scroll down to our lighting mode and

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.800
we're gonna change this to surface forward shading.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.720
Go ahead and hit save.

17
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.560
Now we'll still get a warning here that says the thin translucent materials

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.440
requires the use of a thin translucent material output node.

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.800
All right, so let's go ahead and add that.

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.160
So I'm just going to right click somewhere on the grid itself and

21
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.360
just type in thin and we want a thin translucent material output.

22
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.600
There we go, perfect.

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.360
We should see the two settings, hit save.

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.680
All of our warnings should disappear right now.

25
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.600
And now what I'm going to do is actually just apply the material to our

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.640
example sphere here.

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.120
So I'll just open the content drawer and I can simply just drag and

28
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.600
drop it onto our object.

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.400
Now we shouldn't see really any changes right now and

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960
we're gonna adjust that by adding some parameters to our material.

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.400
So I'm gonna just move this off to the side so we can see and

32
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.000
expand by material window out.

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.440
All right, now from here I'm just going to add a few properties.

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.000
So the first one that I wanna do for

35
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.480
my base color is just hold down the number three and

36
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.440
left click which will get me a three scalars or R, G and B.

37
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.080
I'm just gonna plug this into our base color, black is fine.

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.840
And then I'm gonna hold down the number one and click,

39
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.120
which should give me a single scalar.

40
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.880
And I'm just gonna do that a few more times.

41
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
We'll get ourselves four properties here.

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.360
Go ahead and plug into our metallic and we'll set this at zero and

43
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.560
plug the next one into our roughness.

44
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.360
Now in this case, I'm going to have a very slight roughness.

45
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.720
So we're gonna do 0.02 and we'll plug in our third property to our specular.

46
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
So actually let's go into our opacity.

47
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.000
We can leave specular as the default of 0.5.

48
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.640
So in our opacity, we'll leave this at zero.

49
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.080
And then finally, we're going to plug into our refraction.

50
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.280
Now if you notice that it's disabled, we can enable that if we go back to our

51
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.320
material so we can select the material or click anywhere in the grid.

52
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.600
And what we're going to look for is our refraction mode.

53
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.040
I'm gonna go ahead and just type in refract and right here we have refract

54
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.200
refraction method and on this one we can change it to index of refraction.

55
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.320
And you'll notice now that that property becomes available.

56
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.920
So this is purely optional if you want to use it, you absolutely can.

57
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.800
So in this case, you can set something to we'll do like 1.5.

58
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.800
You'll see that it gives us a slight bit of refraction, which is perfect.

59
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.400
And then finally, the last thing that we wanna do is give our material

60
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
a little bit of color.

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.360
So I'm just gonna hold down the number three to bring up our three vector.

62
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.280
And you can just double click this, which will open the color picker.

63
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.680
And we'll just give it something like a hot pink, it's totally fine.

64
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.760
And we'll plug this into our transmittance color.

65
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.000
We should see now that this should update.

66
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.120
And because this is a material and not a material instance,

67
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.160
you'll notice a viewport doesn't update until we either hit apply or save.

68
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.760
So I'll go ahead and just hit save and

69
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.160
then we should see our example sphere update with the material.

70
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.880
And if we move it out of the way, you see now we're getting our reflections,

71
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.240
our refractions as we would expect with path tracer.

72
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.960
So this concludes us making the thin glass material.

73
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.400
In the next section, we're gonna go a little bit step further and

74
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.320
create another material with a little bit more complexity.
