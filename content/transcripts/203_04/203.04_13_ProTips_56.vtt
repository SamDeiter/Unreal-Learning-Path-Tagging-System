00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
When multiple denoises are available in your project,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.520
Unreal uses console variables to decide which one path tracer relies on.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.360
You can use r.pathTracing.spatialDenoiser.type

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.600
and toggle between spatial, zero, and temporal, one denoising.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.400
You can use r.pathTracing.denoiser.name

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.280
to pick the spatial denoiser you prefer.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.800
So for example, NNE denoiser, the default, or OIDN.

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.240
For temporal denoising, use r.pathTracing.temporaldenoiser.name

9
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.400
to choose between the options like NFOR, which is the default,

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.600
NNE denoiser, or OptiX.

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.560
These tips simply give you finer control over which denoising method is applied,

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.280
helping you balance speed, stability, and image quality.

13
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.120
Here are some additional CVars for targeting your final image quality.

14
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.000
Note, if you ever change a CVar's value and are unsure of the original default,

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you can type the CVar into Unreal's command line

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.520
and hover over the text to see a tooltip

17
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.200
which should also show the original default value for that particular CVar.

18
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.360
Path Tracer now includes initial support for rendering heterogeneous volumes,

19
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.040
things like smoke, fire, and clouds.

20
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.840
You can create these volumes using the Niagara Fluids plugin

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.800
or by adding a heterogeneous volume actor directly in your scene.

22
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.280
These actors use sparse volume textures, for example, VDB files,

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.680
which can be imported and rendered natively in Path Tracer.

24
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.680
This means complex volumetric effects like simulated smoke plumes,

25
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.280
rolling clouds, can now be rendered with full path trace lighting and shadows.

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.800
As of the latest update, Path Tracer supports both static

27
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.320
and moving heterogeneous volumes,

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.520
giving artists far more greater flexibility for cinematic and visual effect work.

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.320
Now, before you dive too deep into path tracing,

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.520
keep in mind a few limitations.

31
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.080
First, heterogeneous volumes are only partially supported.

32
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.440
This includes effects like smoke and fire.

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.480
The sky atmosphere system isn't yet fully compatible with this feature,

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.120
so the results may vary depending on your scene setup.

35
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.920
Next, with Motion Blur, for the most accurate Motion Blur,

36
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.760
use the Movie Render Queue and enable Reference Motion Blur in the Path Tracing module.

37
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.160
This will give you a smoother, more physically accurate result,

38
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.560
though at a higher performance cost per frame.

39
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.040
In this mode, no post-processing vector blur is used.

40
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.240
Denoising happens after all spatial and temporal samples are accumulated.

41
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.120
So, for the best result, apply a higher temporal samples

42
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.680
and be mindful of the tick rate limitations when working with Sequencer.

43
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.840
And lastly, volumetric clouds are also only partially supported.

44
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.160
They can be captured through the skylight or represented natively

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.680
when referencing atmosphere mode is enabled in the post-processing settings.
