00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Path Tracing Ray Type switch node can be used to replace material information for shadows, indirect specular, volume, and diffuse rays.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Path Tracing Ray Type switch node lets you feed different material inputs depending on the ray type being traced.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have camera, shadow, indirect diffuse, indirect specular, and volumetric.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a path tracing only node that we can add to our material that's used to fine tune how material behaves under different ray evaluations.

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So in short, the node gives you a per ray type material control, allowing artists and TDs to reduce noise, improve render performance, or fine tune artistic or physically based behavior when using Unreal Engine's Path Tracer.

6
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, if we jump over to the project, you'll see that I have applied here a quick debug material that I've created.

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, before I show the material, one quick change you may have noticed is that the viewport is a little bit darker than normal.

8
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And all I've done is simply gone to my perspective and under game settings, I've just unchecked it and adjusted my EV.

9
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So if I turn this on, these are the settings that the scene will use.

10
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So if the level has a post processing volume, it will use those post processing volume settings.

11
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Or by simply unchecking it, I can manually override it.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So that's the only difference here. And that's just to help better visualize and see this material.

13
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, if I bring the material over, I'll leave this up on screen so you can see it's a very basic material.

14
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And if I click the material or the empty graph, I'm going to go over to my details panel and click the little settings cog and do show only modified properties.

15
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And this will show you the properties that I have changed outside of just the basic material.

16
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So from the previous sections, you should be comfortable creating a basic material, going into these properties and changing them.

17
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then, of course, adding properties like our single scalars or our three scalars.

18
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And if you notice here is our path tracing ray type switching node that we have been discussing.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So from here, I've just simply plugged in various colors and then applied it to our debug sphere.

20
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And then I can start to visualize how the engine is processing all of those different passes.

21
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All right. In the next section, we're going to cover some of the post processing material buffers and how we can modify those to our liking.
