00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Path Tracer is a progressive hardware accelerated rendering mode

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that mitigates the disadvantages of real-time features

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with physically correct and compromise-free global illumination,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
reflection, and refraction of materials and more.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Path Tracer uses the same ray tracing architecture as other ray tracing features in Unreal Engine,

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
such as real-time ray tracing and GPU lightmass,

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
making it ideal for use in pipelines where ultra-realistic visuals are desired.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Path Tracer is not intended for real-time applications,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but rather for achieving ultra-high fidelity and realistic visual output.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Path Tracer provides the following benefits when compared to other rendering modes.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The ability to generate high-quality photorealistic renders with physically accurate results.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Minimal or no additional setup required to achieve comparable results to other offline renderers.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It reduces the feature gap of comparable real-time features.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For example, materials seen in reflections and refractions are rendered without limitations,

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
such as having global illumination or path trace shadows present.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It has full integration with Sequencer and Movie Render Queue to support film and TV quality render outputs,

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it has full effect support with heterogeneous volumes.

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
To enable Path Tracer on your project, navigate to the Project Settings and under Rendering,

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
select Hardware Ray Tracing and ensure that the Support Hardware Ray Tracing and Path Tracing are enabled.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
After the Project Settings are configured, you can activate Path Tracer by selecting Path Tracing

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
from the Viewport View Mode drop-down menu.

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Path Tracer will immediately begin calculating the scene.
