00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Unreal Engine fully supports eye and hair shaders with Path Tracer.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Additionally, we can use material parameters to selectively control glass absorption.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All of these will be automatically calculated based on the shading model of the material,

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which can be modified in the parent material under Material, Shading Model.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Unreal Engine also has the ability to leverage energy conservation on materials.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You can enable this setting in the Project Settings under Engine, Rendering, Material section,

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and ensure that the Enable Energy Conservation on Material parameter is checked.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, depending on the nature of your project or your intended target hardware,

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you may opt to create fallbacks for non-path tracing configurations within your materials.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You can create a simplified material for ray tracing by using the Path Tracing Quality Switch Replace node

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This can improve performance while still allowing the engine to use a more complex material on non-ray traced viewports or hardware.
