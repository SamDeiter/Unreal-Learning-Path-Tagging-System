00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
When using Path Tracer, keep a few things in mind about using skylights.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.720
First, the skylight capture is only visible when real-time capture is enabled.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.320
For higher quality renders, increase the skylight capture resolution beyond what is typically

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.400
used for real-time playback.

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.200
Setting the resolution to 2048 or 4096 should be a good starting point.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.680
If you're not using real-time capture, make sure your skybox or skysphere provides the

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.280
sky's proper visual representation.

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.480
Also, the skybox or sphere should have the material's Is Sky flag enabled in the material

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.080
settings, otherwise the lighting will be double counted, which introduces extra noise.

10
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.560
Finally, your sky geometry, the sphere or the box, should not cast shadows, or it can

11
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
block light contributions from both the skylight and the directional light.

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.540
You can disable shadows on the geometry by unchecking the Cache Shadow in the Assets

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.540
Detail panel.

14
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.840
The skylight can also capture lighting contributions from the sky atmosphere and volumetric cloud

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
systems.

16
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.600
To do this, simply enable Real-time Capture on the skylight.

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.080
Because these features rely on the skylight's Cubemap capture, their visual quality depends

18
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.960
directly on the skylight cubemap resolution.

19
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.680
Higher resolutions mean cleaner, more accurate skylighting.

20
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.320
Note, when Reference Atmosphere is enabled in the post-processing volume, the sky atmosphere

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.380
lighting is calculated volumetrically, providing far more realistic results.

22
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.960
In this mode, any skylight in the scene is ignored since the atmosphere itself handles

23
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.160
all sky illumination through directional lights and local light sources.

24
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.520
Finally, Path Tracer represents the planet as a large sphere, ensuring accurate ground

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.640
reflection and realistic shadowing in bounce light across the sky.

26
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240
In this next section, we're going to cover a few pro tips to keep in mind when using

27
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240
Path Tracer.
