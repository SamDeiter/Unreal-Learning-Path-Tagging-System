  "text": " So, for this last section of the Intermediate Control Rig course, we're going to take a look at creating a hand control that allows us to open and close the fist with just one control, just to show you another layer of control that we can create inside of Control Rig. Essentially, what we're going to need for this is we're going to have to set the rotation on the Z axis of the controls for the fingers, which, for example, we set up parent constraints to the bones, so they'll rotate the bones. But essentially, we're going to set up a slider so that the value that the slider has on one of its axes drives the value of the Z rotation on the controls themselves. Importantly, this is quite similar if you've done some other rig in other programs, like Mea, it's quite similar to connecting two attributes together, or even in a way quite similar to set-driven keys, where essentially you have the attributes of one thing directly control the others. It's not exactly the same, but the type of behavior that you end up with is akin to that. So let's go ahead and take a look at how we set this up. So it's important to understand that we're going to need these parent constraints to drive those rotations of the bones, so we're going to keep this. However, we don't want this to be continued through here because we're doing a foray for each loop here, right? So we don't want to do more math in this loop. So before I do anything, I'm just going to make a sequence in here, and I'll break this off so that it finishes doing that loop and creating the constraints, and then we do something else. So that's essentially the first step. The second step that I'm going to do is actually add some controls. One thing I did while the video was away is I actually set up the hierarchy for the controls a little bit better. So I just included the hand pole vectors and all that stuff within the root control, and now when we move our character, all those controls also move with it. It's just something that I figured it was worth doing, just for cleaning up more than anything. So we're going to need a new control for this. Now the control that we're going to use is going to be a float control, which will essentially force us to only use one axis of movement. So to create a new control, just like always, we just right click, new control, and I'm going to call this the float control. So we're going to call this hand slider. I think that's a decent name. So hand slider. And we'll, in this case, because it's going to be the right side, we'll do first. Sorry, we'll rename that to underscore R. Okay. So now we're going to turn this into a float control. And to do that, under the value type here, instead of an Euler transform, we're going to set this to a float. And you'll notice that instantly we get this sort of line dragged out. And you'll see there's also a primary axis assigned to it. So this you can see, I can't move it any other direction other than the X axis along that line or whatever primary axis I define here. So in this case, it's Y or Z, right? In our case, we'll leave it just on X because it's nicely aligned. But we are going to change the shape itself to be something a little bit nicer. So we'll turn this into, let's see, arrow too thick if that works. And we'll see if we can get a solid one actually. Sorry, wrong place. So arrow for solid. Nope. I think it's arrow too solid. There we go. And one thing you'll notice is that the shape is oriented awkwardly. So I'm just going to hit 90 on the Z here so that it's aligned with that direction. And now you can see I can move this along like so. I'm also going to make this a little bit bigger. So maybe scale it twice as big. And the next thing I'm going to do is change the color. We'll go for something purple. A little bit darker purple. Something like that. And let's see. One thing I do want to do is play with the limits of how this can rotate. So we're going to make a nut hand that opens and closes. So we're going to open beyond the sort of relaxed pose. So we're going to need some minimum and maximum values that we're going to want. So we're going to set the initial value to zero. The minimum value, and I'll just quickly compile this and expand this a little bit because we're missing the max value there. The minimum value is going to be minus 10 for now. And we'll tweak this later on. And the maximum value is going to be 10. So essentially we've got this control that can move between these things. And actually, you know, looking at this in terms of the line and how much it can move, it's not very clear. So let's make those 20 and minus 20. And I think it should cover that pretty nicely. So you can see now we can move along that spline. And we have a central position, which is zero, which is our initial position. Now you'll notice that because we can only move this control in that X direction, we can't move it to somewhere we want. So in order to move this and position it near the hand, I'm going to have to go ahead and create a parent for this so that we can position in the right place. So I'll just make a new control under the root. We'll call this hands slider parent or something like that. And we'll just go with underscore P, I think, the parent. And I'm just going to put the hand slider inside that parent, quickly compile that. And now all I need to do is move the parent to position the control. I'll rotate this over like that. We'll have a nice hand control near the hand, basically. There we go. Now we don't, I don't love having to see this control here, but before we do anything, we're going to set this as our offset control. So set offset transform from current. That way when we compile, it won't go back to zero. And secondly, it could be quite like, first of all, I'm going to make it invisible because I don't want to see it or be able to select it. But it is quite tempting to do that first and then just kind of move it after making it hidden. But as you can just see, there's currently a bug in Control Rig where if you have an object hidden and you try to move, it just flies your camera out of the way. So yeah, don't really, don't touch the controller. I will change it to purple once again, just so that I know that it's the hand slider control as well. So just keeping our conventions correct. And remember, this is for the right side. So I will rename this underscore R and then underscore P for parent. So how do we set up this relationship now between the value of the control here and the rotation value on the controls? So in order to do that, I'm going to go ahead and start by getting the actual controllers that we're going to be driving. So the ones that we're going to be driving are here. And so let's go ahead and do that. So we're going to grab the, well, we can just get children of the hand, basically. So this will be the controls this time that we edit. So I'm going to do hand R control because we're doing the right side first, since that's there. And we want this to be recursive. So it actually gets the children of the children. So it gets all of these, not just the immediate children. And with this array, we're going to do a for each loop and then we'll essentially use the value of this to set the value on rotate Z of all these children. So let's go ahead and get a for each. And remember, this wants to happen after we've set up all our parent constraints. What we're going to do is set the transform of this. So set transform. And how are we going to set the transform? Because first we need to kind of figure out how we're going to make this correlation, right? By the way, it's thrown out an error because we've not looked at any value in the transforms at all. So what we need is to get the value of the controls. So we're going to get the control. Since it's a float control, it's just going to ask us for the value. So I'm going to get the value and I'm going to multiply it. I'm going to multiply it by, let's say, five for now. And the reason this is, is because right now the value that's going to output, it's just going to be the direct value that I've created, right? So my initial value is zero. My main is minus 20. My max is 20. My current is apparently zero. But okay, there we go. So my current is zero. I just wanted to see that that was in the center, but it would be an item by the gizmo. But basically we're going to get that value. It might go all the way up to 20. And then times five is going to be 100. That's going to be 100 degrees. So actually this might be too much. So let's go to 60 degrees. Makes a bit more sense. And then what we need to do is translate this into an Euler rotation. So essentially we need to go from an Euler value to a Quaternion rotation. So if we do from Euler to Quaternion, and we just need to update the Z value, right? And now this is going to give us a rotation, and we're going to want to take care of the rotation order that we go for. So we're going to do X, Y, Z on this. And this we now are going to plug in to the value of the rotation. Now if we compile this, you'll notice that this is pretty broken. And it's because we're doing this in global space. So we want to be doing this on the local space of the actual controls. So now as I drag this slider, if I drag it this way, it opens up. And you can see we're going too far, so we'll worry about that in a second. And as I go this way, it will close up. So the fist actually looks really nice. The open looks a little bit too broken for me. So we're going to make the max value of this. Instead of being 20, we'll make it 10 so that we only multiply that times 10. So this will be like a value of 10 multiplied by 330. And that's about as far as it's going to go. So if I drag this out now, and there you go. That's a much more natural maximum sort of rotation there. And really, this is the setup for a slider control. Now we're only setting this up to show you the slider. Now you'll notice if you tried to come back to this, if I try to make rotations here, it's no longer working. And the reason for this is because we're already constantly setting up this rotation. Now we could enable the X and Y so that we could set them so that we don't set them to anything other than zero. But to be honest, the smartest way of doing something like this, if we want to retain the control of rotating these fingers, is to create a parent above each one of these and make the slider drive the parent so that it still drives these rotations, but then still have the parent constraints on these actual controls. So we'd have a parent for each one of these, and we'd have the slider drive the parents and not the actual controls. And then we'll have the controls just drive the actual joints. And that would allow you to have both systems working at the same time. But the setup is a little bit out of the scope of actually going through and setting all this up right now. We just wanted to show you, you know, there's a different type of control you can set up because it's a little bit more automated. So if you like this, you can set it up for the other side as well. Or if you wanted to, you could set up this control to drive both. And you know how to append arrays and everything now. So you can follow that along if you want there. So in this case, I'm just going to go ahead and comment this and organize it a little bit. So we'll comment this and we'll call this slider finger controls. And really, that's it for this tutorial. If we take a look at the wrap up now, the stuff that we've learned today is how to set up parent nodes or the set new parent node, the IK2 bone node, which allows us to simplify our IK setups. We've taken a look at custom functions, okay, FK chains. We have used the get children node to easily get an array of the children of a particular asset so that we can make operations on them. In our case, we did a bunch of for each operations. We also looked at the parent constraint node to drive those bones with those controls, as well as the use of nulls to essentially add extra bits of control so that we're able to both use the aim control on the head plus the actual rotation control on the head as well. So thank you very much for taking a look at this. If you want to continue cleaning up your nodes, you can use alignment and you can align to top, to middle, to bottom. Well, I kind of think you've probably seen me use this automatically. I use Q to just align everything to the center. So that's a nice little shortcut that you have. Other than that, please take some time to reflect on your training and I hope you enjoyed the course.",
