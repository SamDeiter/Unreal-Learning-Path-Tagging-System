  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on NavMesh Proxy's automatic placement. Now this is a feature which is new for version 5.5 Unreal Engine and this allows us to automatically create NavLinks. So if I start off here, you can see we have all the characters stuck up on this block. And if I stop, we cannot get off there. So the normal process would be to add in a whole load of NavLinks to each of these areas. However, if you wanted to do this automatically, what you would need to do is select the recast NavMesh up in our options here. And we're going to search through, close down display, under generation. We actually have a second, we have a tick box for generate NavLinks. If I was to tick that on, you can see what happens. We've now got a whole load of different NavLinks from in logical places. So if I push play, you can see that our character can now get down off the ledge. Unfortunately, we have the same problem that we have with our NavLink proxies that it's already telling them that these areas are connected. It's not necessarily allowing them to have any functionality to get up to. So we want our character to jump. Now we would do this in a very similar way to what we were previously working on. What we're going to do is we're going to create a smart link and add in the functionality to make the character jump. It's a little bit different. For example, what we need to do is when we need to make a blueprint and it needs to be of the parent type, generate NavLink proxies we have here. Now, I don't want to go through the process again of putting one of these together, but I will show you an example of a finished one. So as you can see here, this is my generated NavLink proxy. And we will automatically have the event, event received smart link reached. This functions in exactly the same way as our standard NavLink. Now, what I'm going to do in this is pretty much exactly the same functionality as we had in the previous video. Connected up, we're going to calculate the velocity and launch the character. And that will make it fire up into the air. Now, in order for it to use this instead of the previous one, what we're going to need to do is in the recast NavMesh defaults, there is the option for a link proxy class. I'm going to drop down and use the my generate NavLink. Now, if I was to jump into the level and play, we can now see that our character. Is not only able to get down, but. They're going to be able to jump up to the areas where they where they run there. So all of these are now accessible through the Netflix. It's just a considerably quicker way. Now, there are a number of more settings. I'm not going to go into detail with them here. They allow you to define the to define how these are set up. And again, it's under recast NavMesh and you'll be looking at the NavLink jump down controls here. So you've got a number of different settings here. OK, so just be aware of that. It's it's really useful, especially if you have a large area and you have a lot of space. It's really useful, especially if you have a large area and but you need to place the logic within the NavLink as per before.",
