  "text": " So you should have open material 201 dash one version or three, and you should be open to this level under maps. Matt 201 underscore one, and you'll have something like this. Your camera may be in a slightly different position, but the shader balls and walls and lights should all be there. And you may recall that to turn off the pulsing floor grid, if you select anything in your scene and hit the G key, it displays as it would when rendered. You can bring these back by going to the viewport show button at the top left and using defaults and everything is back. You can also turn some of these attributes off selectively. You can keep the widgets, for example, these shader, these reflections and lights and turn off the floor grid individually by say selecting grid and deselecting it. And you'll see that the floor has gone quiet. It's no longer pulsing and we still have our skylight and reflection captures and other widgets. Default brings them back. I will be silencing them all for now. The first thing we want to talk about is creating a master material and building one that is more robust. What we'll be taking as our model for doing that is Quixel Megascans. Quixel Megascans is a library of materials and objects that's available to you with an Epic ID and being an Unreal Engine user. They provide all of their materials in a very specific format, which you may recall was explained with this document from their website, what maps are included and how do I use them? And this is actually a terrific guide to using their materials in Unreal and the difference between their name and Unreal's name. And it's a sizable document, but really useful, really great at helping you understand how they've constructed things and how we can build upon that to add functionality that wasn't there to begin with. So this will be what we'll be building, the basic idea for getting underway. And if we select this in the viewport, the details on the lower right show us that the material assigned to it is called Salt Mine Wall. And if we select it, we can navigate to it by using the magnifying glass to the right of it, which will show us in the content browser where it is. And we can double click on it here or in the content browser to bring up its controls. And we can see by looking at its panel that it's an instance because it doesn't have the grid that we'll be looking at in a moment and that its parent, the parent material is listed here as MS default material. You can find it here. You can find it in the material instance hierarchy window by navigating to what it's connected to. And again, by using the magnifying glass, you can reveal it in the finder by clicking on the magnifying glass where it goes immediately to it in the finder. So by double clicking on any one of these, you can bring up the parent. And this should look somewhat familiar to you from the intro to materials class, the material window, and we'll close up some of these smaller panels, the stats and the palette. We can bring those back from the windows menu, palette and stats if we need them. And this is how Quixel Megascans builds their materials for the most part. And if you have a second monitor, you can move this window to a second monitor to follow along as we end up constructing this material. Quixel Megascans generally will include things like albedo, metal, roughness and normal. We've thrown in some other things to play with to think about that you can explore later. We won't be using them here, but we will be putting this together and adding UV controls and we'll do it from scratch.",
