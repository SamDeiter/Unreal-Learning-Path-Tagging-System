  "text": " Now that you have the starter content added to your project, let's take a look really quick at the material that is going to be powering this entire effect. Now, the name of that material is going to be MsmokeSubUV, and it can be found in your starter content by going to our starter content. We're going to go to Particles, Materials, and then MsmokeSubUV can be found right here. Now, this is actually comprised of two different materials. There is this TsmokeSubUV, which is actually a sub-UV image. If you're not familiar with what a sub-UV image is, it is simply an image that captured some type of animation. And then through our particle system, we can actually replay this animation frame by frame. So we start up here and we go like this, and then we keep going, and so on and so forth. And this is going to give us the illusion that some type of animation is taking place. And it's a really, really great way to show off really complex things like smoke interaction that would otherwise be too costly to simulate per frame. So we don't need to do anything with this. It's already been set up for us. The nodes that I want to call out inside of our material here are our particle color and our depth fade. So particle color is utilized to help us tint the base color. But also used to help us adjust the alpha information. So if we didn't have this set in there, we wouldn't be able to do things like set how this particle can maybe fade in or fade out over its lifetime. Depth fade is another node that I want to bring to your attention because it allows this particle to very, very smoothly fade with any geometry that it might have clipped or run into. Without this, there's going to be a really harsh line in between that. Now, the reason that I bring this up is that on lower end hardware, this can be a very expensive operation. So just keep that in mind if this particle is added and then all of a sudden everything slows down. Start moving that depth fade before optimizing anything else as it could be a very expensive operation, depending on the hardware you're working with. Now, that's not all for this material. There are a few other things that I want to call out that are going to help make this material look so realistic once we place it on our particle. That is first off, the blend mode has been set to translucent. Translucent is a very expensive thing to do inside of real time 3D graphics. And in order to strike a good balance between realism and performance underneath our translucency lighting mode, we have actually changed that and set it to volumetric directional. What this is going to do is this is going to allow this to interact with level lighting, but not be so expensive that it could create a rendering bottleneck that could cause performance issues. The next thing is the shadow density scale has been changed to 3.0. This is going to make shadows show up a little bit better once this material has been placed on the particle and allow the shadow just to be a little bit darker, which will make things a little easier to see.",
