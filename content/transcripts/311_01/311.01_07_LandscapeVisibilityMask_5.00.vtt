00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Just before we wrap up here, it'd be good to go over landscape visibility masks for

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.520
if you want to mask anything out in your landscape.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.520
So landscape visibility mask allow you to remove a visual collision mesh of your landscape

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.000
so you can subterrain structures like caves or secret bases, anything where you want to

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
kind of dig into the landscape a little bit.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.420
So it's achieved by placing a landscape visibility node in your landscape material.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.460
And then when applied to your landscape, you can then paint in the visibility of where

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.700
you want to pass through.

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.380
So to create this, you need to make a new material or use an existing material, but

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.340
we need the landscape visibility mask node, which we can add maybe to an existing landscape

11
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.580
material if we want.

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.420
So we need to set the blend mode to masked in this instance, and it'll only work with

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.420
masked materials.

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.300
So make sure your blend mode is set to mask there.

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.260
And then just select the landscape in the editor viewport and look for the landscape

16
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.240
whole material and apply it in that section there.

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.780
Then when we have the landscape tools open, we can go to the visibility section and we

18
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.740
can add or remove visibility using the paint tools as we would with the terrain tools,

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.460
and you can add or remove landscape sections when painting.
