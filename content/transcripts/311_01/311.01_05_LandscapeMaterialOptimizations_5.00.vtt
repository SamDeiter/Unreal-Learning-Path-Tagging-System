00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
Let's take a look now at how you might optimize some of these landscape materials that you're

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.560
creating. So you can adjust landscape so that the further components use a simpler material

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.160
for example. You can also activate the landscape modes panel and select the entire landscape.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.120
And then in the details panel under the landscape component, look for the override material

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.680
section, which you can see here. So you can press the plus icon next to the array just to add a new

6
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.680
element here and then set the LOD index to one. So the LOD index is one there and then we'll have

7
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.120
a new material that we can plug in there. So you can maybe have a more simplified LOD version of

8
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.520
the material here and you can see that the LOD level one will be further out. And then even if

9
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.360
you wanted four, five, six different LODs, depending on the simplified material, you can

10
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.720
do that and load the landscape there. We also can view this in action. So this is what our LOD may

11
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.600
look like. So we've got good detail close to the camera and really good performance for further

12
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.160
away. So the players or the viewers not going to really see too much difference between the two

13
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
materials. But as you can see, there's a lot of complexity going on in this foreground material

14
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.240
and therefore you may not want that being rendered in the distance where the pixels just won't

15
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.000
represent that material. So creating LODs for your materials will be a really good approach there to

16
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
optimize some landscape usage. And then we can also talk about distance blending as well. So

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.920
distance blending allows you to blend one set of textures into another. So you would want to do

18
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.960
this, for instance, where you have a highly detailed landscape that visually breaks down when viewed

19
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.720
at close distance. So there are a number of different ways to approach this, but the quickest

20
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.960
and easiest is to just use this distance blend material function that comes inside of Unreal.

21
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.820
We can also have a shared source. So if your landscape material stopped compiling, it could

22
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.720
be because you're using too many texture samples. So a sampler is something that tells a GPU how to

23
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.880
sample the textures, whether it's linear filtering, point filtering, wrap addressing,

24
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.160
etc. The D3D11 has a hard limit of using 16 texture samples and it's not something we can

25
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.400
change. So you can use fewer samples in your material by changing the sampler source to shared

26
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.760
shared wrap or clump, which you can see in this image here. Doing this, I will allow you to now

27
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.880
use up to 128 unique textures. So from 16 to 128 into a single material, but don't enable this

28
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.720
right away and only enable it if you need to.
