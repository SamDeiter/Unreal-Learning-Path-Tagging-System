00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Now that we've covered some weight map based examples, let's talk about height map based examples.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.400
So you can see how we approach a height based material.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.000
You can see how it works by showing a specific material when the landscape slope reaches a certain angle here.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.400
So it means that the flatter areas will be covered in a grass texture and all surfaces that have the slope will have a dirt or rock texture assigned like in this example.

5
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.800
So the above image shows that the grass material function will be shown from zero.

6
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
So we can see the zero on the grass there.

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.200
And then as the slope of the landscape approaches point five, it will then blend to the dirt, which we can see point five.

8
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.000
And then once the slope reaches an angle greater than point five, we can see it goes straight to one there, which is the rock in this example.

9
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.600
So the material setup you'll use are these three nodes specifically.

10
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:14.200
We've got the material function, which are little snippets of the material graphs that can be saved in your content browser and you can reuse these functions across multiple materials.

11
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.000
We'll also need to have a make break material attributes, which these nodes are used for when you have a layered material workflow.

12
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.800
And it allows you to not only use one aspect of the material that is being sampled, but for example, you may have a material layer that defines some kind of nice looking generic material such as steel.

13
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.600
And then you may want to use the roughness and base color attributes from that layer in your final material.

14
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:50.600
So rather than using the whole thing, you can use it in such cases where you might break the material attributes node to split up all of the incoming attributes of the material layer.

15
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.200
And then just picking to plug in the layers that you want.

16
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.200
And then just to cover the world aligned blend, which is the material expression, the world aligned blend.

17
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.400
This function takes in a vector and compares it against the world space surface normal.

18
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:19.000
So the function provides zero to one alpha output where zero represents perpendicular vectors and then one represents parallel vectors.

19
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.400
So if you think about it in a slightly different way, when using the Z axis, your in world vector value is going to be zero zero one.

20
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.700
So we're talking about the one in the Z axis there.

21
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.900
So if that it will output black and white texture where the white represents flat and black represents a slope.

22
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.100
So this value can be biased and sharpened to create clean lines between alpha values.

23
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.100
And we can we have a few other controls here that will allow us to get the results that we want.

24
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.500
So here's an extremely simplified process of how we might create this.

25
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.700
So when making a height based landscape material, the order in which the layers are put together is going to be super important here.

26
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.200
So for example, we have rock and then dirt and then grass.

27
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.200
So this makes sense as rock breaks down into dirt and grass grows into dirt.

28
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:26.700
So really, really simplified process here, but hopefully gives you an idea of how that height based result may look inside your editor here.
