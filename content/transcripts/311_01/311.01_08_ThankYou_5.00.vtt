00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So thank you for watching today's course on advanced landscape materials.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hopefully you learned a lot with the bases that we covered,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
whether it be from basic hand painting materials,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
either the weight or height map based materials.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Also a little bit of optimisation on landscape materials

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to make sure there is performance as it can be.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We discussed a little bit of virtual texturing

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and how you might approach virtual texturing in your projects,

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and also how to create holes in your landscape

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so you can paint in caves or anywhere where you want to go through the landscape

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as a player or a viewer.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So hopefully that gave you some good starting points and directions

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to move in with your landscapes, and we'll see you in the next course.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Thank you.
