00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
So starting off with hand painted materials,

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.260
let's talk about how we might go about creating a material

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.080
set up for hand painted materials.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.540
So to set this material up,

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.000
you just need to first add a landscape layer blend node

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.800
into a material, which you can see here.

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.680
You can see the image on the left-hand side as well.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.240
And so this node will specify which layers

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.080
and the colors of layers that you want

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.280
in your landscape material.

11
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.400
So you can actually add more inputs here

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.520
by pressing the plus button.

13
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.620
And so for this example, we'll be using three layers.

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.580
We'll use a grass color, a dirt color and a rock color.

15
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.700
And then just so you can name them the relevant blends.

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.540
And then when we actually get to our landscape,

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.680
we can apply the material that we've just created

18
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.800
to the landscape.

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360
So we want to open up the landscape tools

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
and then click on the paint option.

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.440
And then we should have these three entries

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.560
that you previously created,

23
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.800
which is the grass, the dirt and the rock.

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
So if we press the plus icon here next to the layer

25
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.560
and select weighted blend layer,

26
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920
which the brackets is normal there,

27
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.160
we can save the new created asset

28
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.360
in a location in your content browser.

29
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.640
It'll suggest somewhere.

30
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.360
So you can go ahead and save it there

31
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.840
unless you'd like to save it somewhere different.

32
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.400
But if you also look at the weighted blend layers,

33
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.600
it allows you to paint on top of layers

34
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840
so that the layers blend correctly.

35
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.620
So we can use this when we want to blend,

36
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.580
say rock into dirt, for example.

37
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.320
So a non-weighted blend layer

38
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.800
would allow you to replace the layers

39
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.760
as you paint over them.

40
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.640
So you can use this when you want to have,

41
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.760
say snow covering rocks or dirt.

42
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.640
So just think about whether you want to

43
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.080
use the weighted blend layers

44
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.720
or the non-weighted blend layers

45
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.860
and the difference, as we said,

46
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.180
weighted blend means that you can blend more easily,

47
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.360
say from rock to dirt.

48
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.560
Non-weighted means that you might have snow covering rock

49
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.920
or something like this.

50
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.280
And then we can repeat that process

51
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.640
for the dirt and rock layers.

52
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.720
And then when we're done,

53
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.960
we'll be able to hand paint the landscape

54
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.840
by selecting the layer from the list

55
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.400
and then just painting it directly in the viewport.
