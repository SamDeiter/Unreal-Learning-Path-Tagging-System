00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Next, let's look at creating some weight map based materials.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So weight maps are black and white maps that define where certain layers

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and your landscape material will show up.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The weight maps can generally be generated in your external DCC

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then imported to respect the layers inside of Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So you can generate these maps by hand,

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but just make sure that you note the size of the landscape that you are creating

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so that you can create things to the correct scale

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then you can therefore import them correctly.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So looking at a material that supports the weight map pipeline,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the material can be set up in a similar way to how we just created the hand painted material.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So we can use the layer blend node,

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then once the material is set up, we still want to apply it to the landscape again in a similar way

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then open the landscape tool, which you can see here on the image on the right hand side.

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So the size of the layer weight map will be the size of the overall resolution when the landscape was created.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So in this example, the size of the layer weight map should be 249 by 249 pixels,

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which you can see on the left hand side here.

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But if you are not sure what size, you can always just right click on the layer from the menu,

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
select export to file, which is the option that you'll see in the list there.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And you can then export that layer to say a PNG file.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So once you have a layer weight created, you can then import it by right clicking on the layer it is associated with

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and then select the import from file, which you can see the image for here.

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So you will get a warning if your overall resolution wasn't set correctly.

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So just make sure the source file is related to the overall resolution and then you can click import.

25
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then here's an end result of what you might get when you have a weight map material.

26
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So with this method, you can see some really nice natural looking results here.

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The image was made using World Machine to generate the height map.

28
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And then the weight maps and then the material was set up just like in the hand painted material example we just went over.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
However, each layer was imported from a third party app.
