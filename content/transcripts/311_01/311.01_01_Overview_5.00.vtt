Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on creating advanced landscape materials.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.600
So today we'll talk about creating hand-painted materials, we'll talk about weight map based

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.000
materials, we'll talk about height map based materials, and then creating holes in landscape

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.520
and some material optimizations you can do when it comes to landscape.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.740
We'll also cover some virtual texturing techniques and then also how you may go about creating

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.440
holes in your landscape for some more natural looking results.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440
So let's jump in.
