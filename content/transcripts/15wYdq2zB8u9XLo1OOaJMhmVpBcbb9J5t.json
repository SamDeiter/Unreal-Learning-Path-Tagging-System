  "text": " Now that we have verified that our project is working, we can move on to creating the additional menus that we need for a full loop to happen. In order to do this, the first thing that we are going to do is create another widget blueprint, and we're going to call this new one Game Over UMG. So let's go ahead and create that and open it up inside of the editor. So again, to create any widget blueprint, we're going to right click, User Interface, Widget Blueprint. We will select User Widget as the parent, and then we will call this Shift WB, or Widget Blueprint, and Game Over. Apologies, my Shift key is broken, so sometimes mine does not come out all that great. Let's do that again, underscore. All right. Let's go ahead and double click on this to open it up. And I'm going to make this widescreen. Now, as we've done with things in the past, we are going to add an image to this particular background button. We're going to add a lot of things to this, but basically, we're going to add an image. We're going to set it to full screen and select a color. So this is going to give us just a pure color background for simplicity sake. We're going to put some text on it as well as a button. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and do this first part. Right, so first things first, let's go ahead and put a Canvas panel on here. We have something to work with. And then what we're going to do is we're going to look for an image. We're going to drag this image right on top of our Canvas panel. And right now, it's just going to sit up right there. And that's OK. And next, we are going to grab some text, and we'll put the text on there. And then we're going to grab a button, and we're going to put the button on there. So again, all of this is kind of just stuck up here, and we're going to fix some stuff so that all of this will look like an actual screen. Now, the first thing we're going to do is with our image, we're going to go to our anchor full screen, make sure we don't have any offsets, and set the color to whatever color we want. The reason we want to do this is we want our image to always maintain this aspect ratio. So to do this, again, we're going to come here. We're going to grab our image. And from our anchors, we have this full screen. I'm just going to hit Control while I do that, and that's, boom, going to pop that to full screen right there. Now, let's give it a color. So we're going to click on Color. I'm going to make mine light greenish, maybe more on the orangey side. That looks kind of cool, maybe a little more saturated. There we go. Whatever color you want is totally fine. So what we're going to do now is something like this. We are going to have the game over final score, and then a restart button. So as we have done in the past, I want you to rearrange the stuff on your particular image, or I should say your particular UMG, to match what we have on the screen. And I'm going to do that now. Right, once you have something like this, the next thing that we're going to do is, as we did with our text for our UI, we are going to go to our final score. And then what we're going to do is we are going to create a binding for our final score, I should say. And we are going to get the current score and then print it out. And then we're going to go to our final score, and we're going to go to our final score. And then print that out so that when the game is over, you see the end score. So again, to do this, what we're going to do, we're going to come back over here to Unreal, we're going to grab our final score, and then under content text, we're going to bind, create binding. Once the binding has come up, we're going to get player. We want the player pawn. And then from the player pawn, we are going to cast to the vehicle advanced pawn. We're then going to click on this and convert it to a pure cast. And if you have forgotten to do that, that could be one reason why things aren't working. But remember, again, right clicking on the cast will turn this to a pure cast, allowing us to bypass some of those checks there. What we're going to do after that is we're going to pull off this as vehicle advanced pawn, and we're going to get. And we might have to, oops, maybe I'd spell that right. And get current score, there we go. And we are going to need to format this text. And remember, as we did before, we can put in what we want here. So you can put in score and then plug like that. And then finally plug this into here. So let's go ahead and compile and save. Now, next part, what we're going to do is we are going to click on the so that when we restart, we can actually do something different. Basically, we are going to restart our map. But there is one thing that we have to check on first. We need to make sure we know the exact level name of the level that we want to restart. So in our project right now, if I was to just move this over, this is the vehicle example map. So again, what we're going to do is we're going to grab our button here. We're going to scroll down to our on clicked and hit the plus sign right here. And when this button is clicked, what do we want to do? We want to set input mode to game only. And then we want to get our player. Get player. We want to get our player controller because we want to set the input mode game only on our player controller. And then what we want to do is we want to open our level by name. So open level by name. And what is the name of that? Well, the name of that is vehicle example map. So let's just make sure that I spell this right. Now, if you were dealing with another map or another project or something like that, you would need to make sure that this open level by name is the level that you would open. But this is the node that you use to open any level. So you can even have this on a trigger. So when your player jumps into the trigger, you could use the open level by name to progress your level action. So that's very, very, very cool stuff.",
