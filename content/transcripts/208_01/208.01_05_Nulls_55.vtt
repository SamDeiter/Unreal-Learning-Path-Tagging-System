00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
The next thing that we're going to take a look at are nulls.

2
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:08.599
Now nulls you can imagine work in a similar way to groups in Maya,

3
00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.880
where they help you add essentially just an extra layer of control within your hierarchy.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.359
We're going to add a null into the hierarchy of our control rig to give us control over

5
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.800
the head's rotation, whilst it's also aiming at the head control.

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.199
So we can sort of tilt the head if we want to while it's turning and

7
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.719
just add the extra level of control.

8
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.919
So the logical workers follows.

9
00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.039
The new head control, which is this ring around our character's head at the moment,

10
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.399
will be a child of the null.

11
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.879
And the null is this sort of orange,

12
00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.560
three-pointed shape that you can see inside the character's head.

13
00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.960
And this control is basically going to follow that null wherever it goes.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.640
And the null is going to be pointing towards our head aim control,

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.879
instead of what was the head bone previously.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.200
And then this new head control, we'll use that to set the transforms of the head bone,

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.439
instead of the head aim control that's doing that at the moment.

18
00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.640
So back inside the engine, we've opened up the head aim control rig,

19
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.240
and this is the one we're going to adjust and add a little bit of extra control to.

20
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.840
So the first thing we need to do is create our null.

21
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320
And we want to create that at the location of the head,

22
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.840
because ultimately that's what we're going to be controlling.

23
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.159
So if you right click the head, come up to new and then new null,

24
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.800
that'll create a new null for us as a child of the head bone.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.680
But we want to bring that out of the hierarchy and I'll press Shift P to do that.

26
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.480
And if I scroll down to the bottom, I actually want a hierarchy.

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.080
I actually want to re-parent that into the Spino 1 control,

28
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.879
so that wherever the Spino 1 goes, the head will follow.

29
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:54.319
Now you might find by default that you can't actually see your null within the viewport.

30
00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.199
And if that's the case, you can come up to the option box up here and tick on display nulls.

31
00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.719
Something else you notice is you can't actually move the null inside the viewport.

32
00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.879
If you needed to move it, you could adjust the values here.

33
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:15.840
Or come up to the top to your solve direction and actually toggle on construction event.

34
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.360
Because that's what allows you to move the null within the viewport.

35
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.240
But since we're not going to need to move ours, I'm just going to right click it

36
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.280
and set initial transforms from closest bone,

37
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.400
just to make sure that we haven't made any adjustments to its initial position

38
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.240
when we've done the re-parenting.

39
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.560
Now we need to create our new head control.

40
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.800
And we want it to be a child of the null.

41
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.760
So I'm going to right click the null, come up to new and create new control.

42
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.560
And then I'll bring that up, drop it inside the head null.

43
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.439
And again, I'm going to set offset transforms from closest bone,

44
00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.760
just to make sure that it matches the rotation of the head bone.

45
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.200
And I'll just adjust the look of it here so we can match sort of our spine and our root here.

46
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.600
And scale it up slightly.

47
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.240
And we can see we're off 90 degrees in the y-axis, so I'm just going to add 90 there.

48
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.880
And probably make it just a touch bigger.

49
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.800
Maybe make that three.

50
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.120
There we go, that's a little better.

51
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.760
And I'm going to rename that to be our head underscore control.

52
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080
So if I right click rename, head underscore CTRL.

53
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.080
So in our hierarchy, we now have a new head null at the location of the head bone.

54
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.080
A child of that null is our head control, which means wherever that head null goes,

55
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080
this head control is going to follow.

56
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.080
Now all we need to do is update our aim logic so that our head null is pointing towards the head aim control.

57
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.080
And then set the transforms of our head bone with the new head control that we just created.

58
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.080
So inside the head aim setup just here, we're going to change the item to a null and then input our head null.

59
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.080
And we'll see that as we move this, we can see our control low, which is a child of the null,

60
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.080
is actually now moving when we move the head aim control.

61
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
We come back and make sure display nulls is just turned on.

62
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.080
We can also see that the null is now pointing towards this head aim control.

63
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:42.079
Now all we need to do is tell the null to control the head control, sorry, to control the head bone.

64
00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:49.079
And we'll do that with, well, a set transform and a get transform node.

65
00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:59.079
And we'll do that by dragging the head in and choosing set bone and then dragging the head control in and choosing get control.

66
00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:05.079
So we're going to set the bones transforms based on the head controls transforms,

67
00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:13.079
which means that as we move this, the null is moving and pointing at the head aim control,

68
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:18.079
which is in turn moving the head control because it's a child of the null.

69
00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:27.079
But then if we move this head control, we also get an extra layer of movement or an extra layer of control on top of the aim.

70
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:34.079
So that if you wanted to make sure something was looking at the aim control and then maybe cocking the head a little bit,

71
00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:40.079
that's just a nice little extra level of control that you can have when you're using things like nulls.
