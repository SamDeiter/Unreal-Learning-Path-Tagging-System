00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to the intermediate control rig course in Unreal Engine version 5.5.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to be following on from the introduction to control rig course,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where we'll be continuing to build the rig that we created in that class.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This time we'll look at some new tools and techniques that will help simplify and improve the control rig,

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
as well as some new functions and control types to develop your overall control rig knowledge.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We'll be continuing to build our rig from the introductory class,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
building in a more modular series of exercises this time that you can then learn from and use to build into your own rig.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We'll take a look at a new function called the IK2Bone function,

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
improving on the basic IK node that we were using last time and simplifying our setup,

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
as well as how to create and utilize your own custom functions in your own function library.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And then we'll take a look at two other control types, nulls and floats,

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to see how you can gain an extra level of control within your rig.
