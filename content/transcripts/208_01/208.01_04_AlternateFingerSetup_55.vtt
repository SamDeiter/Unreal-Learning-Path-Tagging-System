00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Now that we've set up the fingers using a custom function, we're going to explore

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.839
an alternate setup that will use a couple of different nodes, the getChildren node and

3
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.160
the parent constraint node.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
So instead of using a series of set and getTransform nodes, we're going to use the getChildren

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.800
node, which does exactly what it implies, it will find all of the children of a specific

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
reg element.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.600
And in this case, we'll use our hand bones to find all of the finger bones below, and

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.039
again, use that information to find all of our finger controls as well.

9
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:42.039
So with our getChildren nodes, if I right click, search for getChildren, you can see

10
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.880
we can input a name here and essentially an item, a reg element, and it will find all

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.120
of the children of whatever we input here.

12
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.040
Now we do want to look for a bone, and we want to look for handL.

13
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.280
Now I'm going to duplicate this because we want to use, well, we want to find the bones

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.479
for both of our hands.

15
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.560
So if I find handR there.

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.000
Now what we want to do, just to make the logic a little bit more straightforward, is add

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.519
these two arrays together.

18
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:19.719
So if I right click and search for add under the array heading here, we'll plug the first

19
00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.640
array in here, and then it's not add, what is it?

20
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.319
It is append.

21
00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.439
So we want to append the two arrays together, which is just essentially tagging one onto

22
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.719
the end of the other.

23
00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.239
So now that we have a big list of our bones underneath our hand, left and our handR.

24
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.000
Now something we need to activate is recursive.

25
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.719
What this will do is find all of the children of the hand's children.

26
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:57.319
So if I show you this as an example, under our handR, the real children are the pinky

27
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.120
metacarpal, the ring metacarpal, and the middle metacarpal.

28
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.240
So essentially the parents of our new smaller chains here.

29
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.920
And with recursive ticked, what that will do is search through all the way to the end

30
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.920
of the chain.

31
00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:18.599
And making sure include parent is unticked means we won't affect the actual hand bone

32
00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.599
itself.

33
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.039
Now what we want to do, something called a forEach, and this will loop through each

34
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.279
element of the array.

35
00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:39.000
And we're going to connect our appended arrays together to this forEach.

36
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.800
And then we're going to create a parent constraint node.

37
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
And what we want to do here is plug in our child, which will be our bones.

38
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.600
And then our parent is going to come from the name of our forEach.

39
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.280
We'll use another concat node, underscore control.

40
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.320
So that means that for the end of all of our bone names here, we're going to add underscore

41
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.800
control.

42
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.800
And then inside the item of parents, we're going to drop the name in there, change that

43
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.720
to control.

44
00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:34.240
And hopefully we should see if we connect up this logic to the main forward solve.

45
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.759
What I'll do here is just create a sequence just to make this a little clearer about how

46
00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:46.039
this logic is working, just so we can compartmentalize things a little bit.

47
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:54.120
And what we should see now is that our finger control actually controls our bones.

48
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.599
So if I was to just disconnect here, just to make sure we're not seeing anything tricky,

49
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.240
nothing works yet.

50
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.879
And when we reconnect our logic back up, we can see that it works straight away.

51
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:15.840
So that's just another way to simply connect your controls with your bones.

52
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.079
By building all of the logic off the name of your bones, appending the two arrays together,

53
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.919
and then for each of the elements in the array, adding underscore control to the name so that

54
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.000
we can use that as our parent inside the parent constraint, and then adding the element of

55
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.719
the array, which is just the bone names themselves as the child of our parent constraint.
