00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So to wrap up, we went over how the IK2Bone function works and

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.759
how you would set that up in your control rig.

3
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.000
We made a custom function and then learned how to set up a function library

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with the ability to share our custom functions across the entire project.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We learned a couple of different ways to set up our finger controls,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
depending on what possibly works best for your rig.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We also did some work with nulls to help add an extra layer of control within your control rig.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And lastly, we explored a new control type, the float control,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and learned how to convert the values from that control into rotation

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and drive another set of controls with its movement.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So hopefully now you have a better understanding of some more of the functions and features found within control rig

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that you can take away with you to develop and improve your own rigs.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you very much for taking part and following along if you did.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Feedback is always welcome for the course,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so if you have anything to share, please do get in touch.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But otherwise, best of luck with your control rigs.
