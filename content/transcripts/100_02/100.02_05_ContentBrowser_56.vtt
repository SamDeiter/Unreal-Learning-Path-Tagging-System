00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
Hello and welcome to this next video, only interface series and we're going to be looking

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.560
at the content browse.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.359
Right, so we're back into the editor and up to this point we have been either using the

4
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.400
actors that were already in the scene or we have been using the quickly add to project

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.640
button in the top here.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.920
Now for this I would like to concentrate on the content browser.

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.000
Now the content browser can be accessed across the engine by holding down control and space

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.640
bar.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.760
What that's going to do is that will bring up the content browser here.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.400
Now I use the content browser a lot so I am going to click on the dock in layout and what

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.840
this is going to mean is the content browser is now added to the screen here.

12
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.120
If you don't like it in this location you can always drag up and place things in different

13
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120
places.

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.800
You can do that with all of the windows but I'm used to it being in the bottom of the

15
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.400
screen like this sort of throwback to previous versions of Unreal.

16
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.200
So the content browser is our file navigation system much like Windows Explorer on the windows

17
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.600
it's going to allow us to look into different folders and see what files are there.

18
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.879
Now at any point for example with this MI third person call way this is a material by

19
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:42.480
right hand click you can see I can actually come over and see this file in Explorer.

20
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:53.760
Let's go show in Explorer and we can access and see the U asset files in the Windows Explorer.

21
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.640
Again I want to iterate to not move files around within the Windows Explorer it will work.

22
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.040
What it will do is break any references that connect to that asset.

23
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:19.680
Okay so let's talk about the content browser on the left hand side here we have our breakdown

24
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.920
of the file system we can move through it much similar to your normal file system and

25
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.040
on the right hand side we have what is actually in our file system.

26
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.080
Again you can double click on any of them and you can also double click to open up any

27
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080
of the assets.

28
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.040
So in this case I've opened up the third person character which we haven't really touched

29
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:51.039
on how these work at this point but that is a blueprint that I've opened up.

30
00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.840
Now there are a couple of things which are useful to know in order to navigate easily

31
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.879
around this.

32
00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.959
The first thing is if I was to select something within the world for example how the cube

33
00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.599
and I was to press control B that will navigate to that object in the browser.

34
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.759
The control B at any point will navigate to the specific asset in the browser so that

35
00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.079
you can find it.

36
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.000
And this is really useful because at any point we can take an asset and drag it into the

37
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.959
world and that will create an equivalent actor if possible.

38
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.360
In this case these are static meshes which are models and if I was to drag one into the

39
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.960
world it's actually going to create a static mesh actor with the values of the static mesh

40
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.520
being set to the mesh that we've identified and the materials of the default material

41
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.080
on this asset.

42
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.439
Delete that and go a little bit just per cushion the delete button.

43
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.680
However some of these function differently.

44
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.519
For example if we go back to our content directory and we had somewhere in here we had a we in

45
00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.000
the third person we had this material which is the third person cover Y.

46
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.839
You can see this is the color which is used on all of these assets.

47
00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:35.879
Now this is not a static mesh and it's a material so that means it will dictate how a static

48
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.839
mesh looks.

49
00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:43.199
Now in this case if I was to drag it in it would not create an actor but what it would

50
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.839
do is it would detect under the mouse cursor what the static mesh is and attempt to apply

51
00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.839
the material to it.

52
00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:59.839
So you can see in this case it's applied that material to the static mesh that we're using

53
00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.839
is the floor.

54
00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:09.839
I'm going to press control Z and that will undo the assigned.

55
00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.839
So they're quite clever.

56
00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:19.239
When we drag in an asset it will know what kind of asset you're dragging in and it's

57
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.400
going to try and apply it to the world in the most logical way.

58
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.800
So material would apply a material a static mesh would create a static mesh actor and

59
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.759
if we were to go back and into our third person character blueprint is going to spawn an instance

60
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.240
of the blueprint into the world like we have here.

61
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
So third person character.

62
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.240
So just by dragging stuff into the world that's going to make sense.

63
00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:03.240
Now there are some things that don't necessarily make sense such as a game mode so that wouldn't

64
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.240
happen with everything.

65
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.960
Okay so that's dragging things into the world and that's referred to as making an instance

66
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160
of the blueprint.

67
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.480
Now as your project becomes more complicated it might be worth knowing some more advanced

68
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.320
methods of navigating your content system.

69
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.000
So the first one is filters.

70
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.520
As you can see here in the top left hand corner there is an open or add filters menu.

71
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.200
If you jump this down or this is going to do if I go to the content directory it's going

72
00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.360
to allow us for example to select on a filter for static meshes.

73
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.439
So now this is going to show me all of the static meshes which are below the content

74
00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:54.079
directory and you'll also see that we get an extra window here for filters so I can

75
00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:56.439
turn this on and off.

76
00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.039
And for example if I wanted materials it's going to show me just the materials which

77
00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:08.079
are below my content directory and there are and you can do that for any any clients

78
00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:13.759
where you can create a custom filter.

79
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.639
Next up would be favorites.

80
00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:21.319
At the moment here you can see we have a favorite section at the top and if we know there is

81
00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:27.279
a directory which we're going to come back to a lot such as blueprints I could come in

82
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:32.959
right hand click on the directory go add to favorites.

83
00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:37.839
Now we'll find under favorites and we'll be able to see the blue pinched direction allowing

84
00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:41.959
us to find it quick.

85
00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:48.299
Also to reinforce that if we were looking for if we had a group of them you can set the

86
00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:51.000
folders to be a specific color.

87
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.359
In this case I'm going to set my blueprints directory to below and now it's easy to see

88
00:07:56.359 --> 00:08:00.759
particular.

89
00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.959
Finally we have collections.

90
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:08.120
Now if you come down to the bottom here what a collection is is it's going to allow us

91
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:16.879
to tag all of the assets with a specific value and then we're going to be able to filter

92
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.519
and see a collection of just the assets that we've tapped.

93
00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:27.359
So for example if I wanted to have if I added a collection and I had a local collection

94
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.200
I'm going to call this meshes.

95
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.120
Now if I wanted to come in I'll select the static meshes and I'm going to drag into the

96
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:50.320
directory all of the meshes which are designed to put together a environment.

97
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.640
And now I can select that and it will just give me these meshes and I can then drag into

98
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.520
the world.

99
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.200
To reiterate what we've covered here you've got favorite directories that are going to

100
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.520
be assembled out moving to a different area.

101
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.880
You've got the directory colors to allow you to quickly see them in the browser.

102
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.280
Collections this allows you to tag different assets and then view only those tagged assets.

103
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:26.600
We've got the filtering system which is going to allow you to filter on different terms

104
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:35.799
usually the type of asset and that will bring us to the end of our video.

105
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:36.600
See you in the next one.
