00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
Hello and welcome to the second video in the importing asset section.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.839
In this, we will be importing a file from an FBX.

3
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.760
And we will be looking at how you'd go about migrating something from one project to another.

4
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.080
Right, let's look at importing into a project via the file.

5
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.799
For this, we are going to use an FBX.

6
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:37.759
This is a common format that you would be able to output from something like Maya or Blender.

7
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:42.399
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start off by opening a new file.

8
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.119
So I'm going to call this Robot.

9
00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:53.599
It's going to be importing a skeletal match for one of our asset packs.

10
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.320
Now, I've got a couple of different options.

11
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.079
But the one I'm going to use here is the import.

12
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.159
If I push import, it's immediately going to jump me into the file explorer,

13
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.280
asking me to find where the files are to be imported.

14
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.879
Now, you're only going to be able to see in this files, which Unreal understands as important.

15
00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:22.920
You can see in this directory, all I have is three PNGs.

16
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
If I was to select one of these, it would import it as a texture.

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And a SK underscore bot, which is a 3D object and is of type FBX.

18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.719
FBX is supported by default.

19
00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.679
However, there are other versions with plugins you can get the engine to work with.

20
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.960
So I'm now going to select OK.

21
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.960
And it's going to bring me up a huge amount of options.

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.280
And now I know that these options work, so I'm not going to mess around with them.

23
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.960
But you can probably find stuff that would work with your pipeline.

24
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.760
So I'm just going to hit import.

25
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.280
And see importing down here.

26
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.439
And then suddenly we've got everything in already.

27
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.639
Now, if I was to drag in our little character here,

28
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.680
and see that it's in the engine, all right, I'm going to push the G button.

29
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.840
I haven't mentioned this yet, but that puts us in game mode.

30
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.159
And that will turn off any of the widgets that we have.

31
00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.439
So you can see how something would look when it's in game mode.

32
00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.199
And that is working great.

33
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:51.039
I can even open up the material and see that all of the textures and stuff are connected up.

34
00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.359
So it really is quite straightforward, as long as you're using some of the default ones.

35
00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.479
It's just a question of finding the file and importing them.

36
00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:05.319
You may find that the preparation for a clean import is a little bit harder,

37
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.840
especially when it comes to materials, because different engines work with materials in different works.

38
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.079
We will touch on that as we go on.

39
00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:24.519
You also find that you can import animations in the same way and apply them to specific skeletal measures.

40
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.919
So that really is the basics of importing from a file.

41
00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.879
OK, let's talk about migration.

42
00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.879
So that is moving elements from one project to another.

43
00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.919
Now, out of the moment, I jumped into another project here,

44
00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.079
and I have a mesh from our Quixel collection.

45
00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.919
And this is a tree.

46
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.000
And what I want to do is move that into the project that we are working.

47
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.960
So this is how I would go about that.

48
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.840
First thing I would do is I would right-hand click and under asset actions, I would select migrate.

49
00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.280
It asked me to save the level.

50
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.000
And what it's going to do then is it's going to go away and find all of the different dependencies,

51
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.879
which would be required in order to get this model to work in the new project.

52
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:25.399
And it's to be noted, I'm on the same version of the engine, which makes this a lot easier,

53
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.800
makes everything comply.

54
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.639
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go OK.

55
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.759
And then I'm going to the first project and the content directory.

56
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.199
And I'm going to select that.

57
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.560
Now, we're looking to move things into a content directory because otherwise it isn't going to

58
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.879
all of the references route from a content directory.

59
00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.879
So in this case, it needs to be in the content.

60
00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.000
And select the folder.

61
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.919
Now it's going to go away and migrate all those different assets and validate them.

62
00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.919
So here we are back in our original project.

63
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.800
And you can now see that we have this asset directory.

64
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.399
And within the meshes, we have my tree.

65
00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:23.719
I drag this in and take a second for it to be compiled.

66
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Well,

67
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.920
Hey, Presto, the tree is now in the new project,

68
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.040
along with all of its dependencies.

69
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.680
OK, and with that, it brings us to the end of our foundation,

70
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.200
sort of importing assets into Unreal Engine.

71
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440
Thank you very much.
