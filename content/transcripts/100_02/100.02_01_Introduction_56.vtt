00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello and welcome to Quickstart your first project.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This course we will be using Unreal Engine version 5.6.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now this is one of the first courses you should take if you're new to Unreal.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And by the end of this course we hope you will be able to

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
firstly create the right project set up for your goals,

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
navigate through the Epic Games Launcher and the Unreal Engine Editor,

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
have a good idea of how to import and manage assets inside your projects,

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and move content to and from other tools.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Finally, we'd like to go over some of the main modes and features.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now we're not expecting you to learn them from this video.

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What we are hoping is that you'll have a good idea of what areas you need to learn in future,

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
specific to what you're hoping to achieve within the Engine.

13
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Unreal Engine started out its life as solely a game engine.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It was built for the game Unreal Tournament, and this is how it's got its name.

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
However, over the years, not only has it been provided to other game studios

16
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
for creation of a lot of different games,

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but it's also grown to be used in numerous other industries, as we'll go over here.

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The main thing that is unique about a game engine is that it needs to produce

19
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
all of its graphics in real time.

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Unlike other offline tools that can render frames over minutes or hours,

21
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Unreal and other game engines need to do it instantaneously.

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Historically, this would mean that we would have to sacrifice the quality of the output

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so that it could be responsive and fun to play,

24
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but as new methods of rendering have been invented and technology has improved,

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we are able to achieve a quality of output which is very competitive versus other offline renderers.

26
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Unreal these days is now being used in games from Indie to AAA,

27
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
ARC-Viz and simulations for training visualization and interactive tools,

28
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
VR and AR simulations,

29
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and it's also being used in a couple of other new interesting fields such as virtual production.

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This is used in filming where an LED wall is placed behind the actors when filming footage

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and it can then be altered dependent on how the camera moves

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and this can produce much higher quality in-camera footage

33
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and save time in host production, cleanup and VFX.

34
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Unreal is also used in a lot of human machine interfaces such as a lot of the cars that are brought out today

35
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and used in things like the entertainment system.

36
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The output from Unreal Engine is now so good that it is being integrated into a lot of traditional animation workflows,

37
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
allowing animators to see the end product much faster and quickly iterate on their product.

38
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This is why the project setup matters a lot in Unreal Engine.

39
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Different goals need different settings.

40
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
A project for an automotive HMI is not the same as one for a virtual production,

41
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
so starting with the right templates and options is going to save time and avoid headaches later.

42
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Here at Epic Games, we have an entire ecosystem that is produced to support and complement Unreal Engine.

43
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now, there is a lot of tools coming from different stores, photogrammetry tools and things like metahumans.

44
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
First one is UEFN and this is Unreal Editor for Fortnite.

45
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This allows you to build playable experiences inside Fortnite using many Unreal Engine features.

46
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You can access a huge audience and earn based on player engagement.

47
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The other option we have is Twinmotion.

48
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It is a simplified, easier to learn, real-time tool,

49
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
primarily aimed at architectural and design visualisation.

50
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is great for speed and presentation, however you may hit some limits.

51
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
For that, you would need to move to the full Unreal Engine for advanced control.

52
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So that brings us to the end of this introduction.

53
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
In the next video, we are going to download and install the Epic Game Launcher.

54
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We are going to walk through the key launcher options and create our first project with the correct settings.

55
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Thanks for watching. I will see you in the next video.
