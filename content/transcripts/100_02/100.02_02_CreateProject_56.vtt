00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello and welcome to this video on project setup.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.800
In this we're going to be going through all the different steps that are required in order

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.160
to make your first project.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.120
Now before we can actually make a project, we are going to have to download the launcher

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.719
and before even downloading the launcher, we are going to have to create an epic login.

6
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:36.479
In order to do this, all we need to do is visit store.epicgames.com and that should direct

7
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:43.439
you to your local server for that, in this case it shows the US.

8
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:49.799
Now after you're doing this, it's going to guide you through setting up your own epic

9
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.640
games login.

10
00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:00.640
You can use a Google, Facebook, Apple store login and that's fine, we can attach your

11
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.760
account to them.

12
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.719
But this account is going to be quite important.

13
00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:11.000
It's going to be used across multiple different stores and we recommend that you create a

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.480
secure password and keep it all safe.

15
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.040
So once you have summed in, you're going to see in the top right hand corner there is

16
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.680
a blue button on the site that says download.

17
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.440
Clicking on this will take you to the download page and it's going to walk you through three

18
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.560
steps if you want to get hold of the engine.

19
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.440
Now the first one is to download the launcher.

20
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.280
That's all I'd like you to do at this point if you haven't already done it.

21
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.160
And once you have downloaded the launcher, it will guide you through a short wizard to

22
00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.280
install the launcher and you'll be able to fire that up on your system.

23
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.879
Once you've downloaded and installed the launcher, you're going to end up in a page that looks

24
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.120
something like this.

25
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.000
Now by default, it's going to show you some epic game news.

26
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.319
Now this is targeted a lot more to the game's consumers.

27
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.400
So you're going to find that our first step in any of this is about people who are looking

28
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.919
to purchase games.

29
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:28.639
Now you'll see down the left hand side, we have three tabs, the store tab, a library

30
00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.599
tab and an Unreal Engine tab.

31
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.879
If I was to click on the store tab, this will jump us into the game store.

32
00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.280
It's going to allow us to purchase different games from different companies, not all necessarily

33
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.479
made on Unreal Engine and a number of them that are free giveaways to entice people to

34
00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.439
the website.

35
00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.639
Now below this, we will have the library tab.

36
00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.599
It'll skip over that, but that's going to be the games or software that you have purchased

37
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.400
from the store.

38
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.680
It's this last tab which is of interest to us here called Unreal Engine.

39
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.400
If I click on that, it's going to bring us up a very different page.

40
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.960
It will give us a number of other tabs that we have across the top here.

41
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.480
Now all of this is specific to creators or people who use the engine.

42
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.879
So the news that we see in this instance is going to be a lot more about people who are

43
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.480
making computer games or animations and much more specific to that, rather than the external

44
00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.479
games player.

45
00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:49.639
We will also have a whole load of different tabs that are going to offer us starting points.

46
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.839
The last two tabs, Reality Scan, is dedicated to our Reality Scan software for photogrammetry.

47
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.039
I'm not going to cover in this.

48
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.439
And Toyin Motion that we touched on a little bit in the last video.

49
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.120
It's a paired down version of Unreal Engine.

50
00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.360
It's a lot more easy to get up and running with.

51
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.600
Now the one that of interest to us that we're going to jump to is Library.

52
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.920
This is going to give us a number of different sections.

53
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.280
At the top here, we have the different installed engine versions.

54
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.280
I have 5.5, 5.3 and 5.6 installed at the moment.

55
00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:41.559
We'll probably start with none and just a button prompting you to a download version.

56
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:46.799
Below that, you'll have all of the project files that can be found on the engine.

57
00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:51.719
And below that further, we have something that's called the FAB Library.

58
00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.199
We will touch on that as we go on.

59
00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.439
Now the first thing you're going to need is a engine version downloaded.

60
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.959
If I come up here, you can see that there is a plus button that as I push,

61
00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:13.040
it will bring up another version to install.

62
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.759
This will give us a dropdown with all the different versions of the engine we will be

63
00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.759
capable of installing.

64
00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.600
And an install button.

65
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.000
Next to the install button, we have another dropdown.

66
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.199
And that's going to allow us to set it to current or go away and remove.

67
00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.360
If I was to tick install, it's going to ask us a couple of different things.

68
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.599
First thing it's going to do is ask us where we want this installed.

69
00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:46.199
What folder and path that the engine itself will be installed.

70
00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.120
Now this is not the project files themselves.

71
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.800
The projects will be independent of this and can get quite big in themselves.

72
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.240
Now there is the ability to browse.

73
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.960
Below that we have options.

74
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.079
Now I think it's worth looking at the options quickly because this is going to give you

75
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:09.480
an idea of how large the engine is.

76
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.080
Down here we have a download size.

77
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.560
This is just what would be downloaded is 14.54 gigabytes.

78
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:27.319
However, the required storage space once it's all installed and compressed is twice that

79
00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.120
at 38.3 gigabytes.

80
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.560
Now the core components that are required are 33.5 gigabytes themselves.

81
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.560
So these are required.

82
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.639
Without them you're not going to be able to remove them.

83
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.519
But there are a few other options.

84
00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:52.319
For content I would always leave this on because this is a number of textures and effects

85
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.319
and stuff which you can easily add to a project and use.

86
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.959
I find it very useful but it is optional.

87
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.199
The templates and feature packs are 3.7 gig.

88
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.879
I would always leave that on as well.

89
00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.000
And I'll probably keep an engine source.

90
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There are also other options for debugging.

91
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.959
If you're working in C++ you may find this useful.

92
00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:21.000
We also have a number of different options here with target platforms.

93
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.800
And I have them all turned off by default.

94
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.759
You can see that these can get quite large.

95
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:34.399
So a point 8 gig for Android Linux is coming in here at 20 gig.

96
00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:38.279
So you might want to turn these off if you know you're not going to be building to any

97
00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.279
of these.

98
00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.759
All the compilation is being done elsewhere.

99
00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:49.919
Once you hit apply you can install the engine and it will go away and it will install the

100
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:55.519
appropriate engine and you'll have a version that is brought here.

101
00:07:55.519 --> 00:08:00.839
Now that might take you half an hour or so depending on your speed of your internet.

102
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:07.039
So do feel free to pause the video there and hit off again if you have not previously

103
00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:08.199
done it.

104
00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.719
Now next up let's create a project.

105
00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:18.079
So I am going to hit the launch button here.

106
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.079
And that's it.

107
00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:25.000
This is going to go away and fire up Unreal Engine and allow us to select our starting

108
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
project.

109
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:39.519
Now after you've gone away for a bit it should bring you to a screen that looks like something

110
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.399
like this.

111
00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:47.799
Now we're going to ignore the recent projects and we're going to have a look down at what

112
00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:51.600
templates are available to us.

113
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.600
The templates are broken down here by industry as I've made here.

114
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.519
However, don't feel like you are restricted to these.

115
00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.600
We've always changed things as we go ahead.

116
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.680
First off we have games.

117
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.120
Now on the games you can see we have the option for a blank template.

118
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:18.879
We also have a first person, third person, top down, handheld, AR, virtual reality and

119
00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:20.879
vehicles.

120
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:28.120
These have functionality put together in them that allow you a good starting point.

121
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:36.320
What's also interesting to see is if you look down in the settings we have first person

122
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.919
as a main here but within variants we have a few more.

123
00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:48.759
We have none, an arena shooter, a survival horror or all.

124
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:58.039
What this is going to do is add in some extra functionality, some extra classes and models

125
00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:02.600
which will allow you to easily make one of these games.

126
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.439
If you select none you're just going to get a very basic first person shooter with a gun

127
00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:09.439
and your character.

128
00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:16.039
Any of these are going to add in extra functionality and all is going to add everything into it.

129
00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:22.039
You're not limited to these, you can add these in as a later date if you need them.

130
00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:26.639
The main thing that's really useful is for example in the third person characters we

131
00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:31.879
have a couple of variants but this is going to provide us with animations and skeletal

132
00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:42.480
mesh for money and Quinn which are our two default humanoid characters we can use within

133
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480
the engine.

134
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:53.440
Now top down again is going to give us a strategic or twin stick setup.

135
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.000
So these are your main, sort of a quick look at the templates that are also available to

136
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
us.

137
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We have one that is set up and geared for virtual production or VR scouting and we have

138
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.240
one set up just for lighting rigs for performance and end display.

139
00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:19.080
This is what is often used for virtual production where we will display stuff, project stuff

140
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.360
on tools.

141
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:33.000
Within architecture we have a design configurator, a VR or desktop collaborative and a handheld

142
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.560
augmented reality setup.

143
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.799
Within automotive and product design and manufacturing again this is going to give us things like

144
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:48.039
the product configurator which in this example we have a guitar but it could be used for

145
00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:53.599
pretty much anything and it's an application in itself where you just need to add in the

146
00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:58.679
different settings and plug in what you need.

147
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:08.679
Finally simulation for this we have our virtual reality setup and our black simulation document.

148
00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:13.159
So let's select for this we are going to go into games.

149
00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:17.639
We are going to select the basic third person setup.

150
00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:21.000
We're not going to worry about the variants in this.

151
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.399
We're just going to go with the basic.

152
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:31.439
For this we have a project location and a name.

153
00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:35.439
So I'm going to set this to just some defaults.

154
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.080
And let's have a look at the different options that we have on the defaults.

155
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.240
We have blueprints or C++.

156
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.640
Now blueprints is our visual scripting language which we are going to be using in this example.

157
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.960
C++ is going to download all of the C++ code which if you are used to working with C++

158
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.600
is very useful.

159
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440
You can always convert a blueprint only project to a C++.

160
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.240
You cannot go back in the other direction after.

161
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.759
The target platform we are looking at is desktop.

162
00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:16.240
Here we are going to use desktop in this example and the quality presets we are going to set

163
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.240
to maximum.

164
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:26.840
Okay, after we've done this I'm going to hit the button to allow us to create this project.

165
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:35.840
Well, once you've done that you should have something that looks a little bit like this.

166
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:43.120
Let's talk a little bit about how an Unreal project is set up.

167
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.519
Now in most software applications you would usually find that your project is saved to

168
00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.320
a singular file.

169
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.280
So for example a Photoshop would be saved to a .psd file, Word to a .doc and Maya to

170
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.280
a .mb.

171
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.280
Unreal projects don't work like this.

172
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.400
Firstly because the Unreal projects themselves can be incredibly big.

173
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.800
Secondly, because you will often be working with something like source control and there

174
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.400
will be numerous people working on the same projects.

175
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:24.879
Therefore it is beneficial for us to be able to have all of the different files saved out

176
00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:27.319
to their own unique files.

177
00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:33.079
This allows us for source control to be able to lock files when one person is editing them

178
00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.879
so other people can't edit them at the same time.

179
00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:43.559
It also allows our projects to be moved around, move around parts of a project or parts of

180
00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:49.479
an asset and not have to copy the entire project.

181
00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:56.239
So whenever we create a file within Unreal it will create a file on your disk.

182
00:14:56.239 --> 00:15:04.359
Though for example a level would be saved as a .umap file, a asset would be saved as

183
00:15:04.359 --> 00:15:07.000
a .umap asset.

184
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.199
Things like a material would also be solved as a .umap asset.

185
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.640
If you would import a model from Maya for example that too would be converted to a .umap asset

186
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:24.120
and if you imported an image from Photoshop that too would be converted to a .umap asset.

187
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.560
So this means that a project itself is going to have lots and lots of different files to

188
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:36.920
be parts of it and they will be converted to a specific type of file which is readable

189
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.280
and understandable by Unreal Engine.

190
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.840
Now you will be able to see all of these files on the disk.

191
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.560
However it is highly recommended that you never move the files around manually outside

192
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.000
of Unreal Engine and that is because the files all have references where the references connect

193
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.360
to each other and if you move files around outside of the engine in Windows Explorer

194
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.600
for example you're going to break all of those references and your project is going

195
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:14.720
to stop working basically.

196
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.639
You can usually fix them within the project but there's a lot of work.

197
00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:23.560
However if you move things around within the editor it will automatically update all of

198
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.720
the corresponding references.

199
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.840
So that brings us to the end of the project suss up.

200
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:38.040
In the next video we are going to be looking at the interface and how to navigate it.

201
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.800
Thank you very much.
