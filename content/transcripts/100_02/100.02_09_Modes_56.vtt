00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.839
Hello and welcome to this video on the different modes which are available within Unreal Engine.

2
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.040
We're just going to be looking at a couple of them quickly so that you're aware of them.

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.719
If you want to learn more, there are other courses which cover them in detail.

4
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:25.960
Now to change mode, you'll see that there is a drop-down in the top left-hand corner

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.039
of the editor.

6
00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.679
This will allow you to either select the mode manually or it will show you the hotkeys required

7
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.759
to jump to this mode.

8
00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:40.560
And that's Shift plus one of the number keys.

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.039
By default, you will be in the selection mode.

10
00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.039
This is what will allow you to manually select and move items around.

11
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.719
Next up, we have Landscape.

12
00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:04.519
Now the landscape mode is designed so that we can create a large mesh for the landscape.

13
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.439
It will be divided into different segments.

14
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.920
When you first load it up, you're going to see this wireframe green grid.

15
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.039
They will indicate the size of the landscape that you are about to make.

16
00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.799
Now you can either generate this from a height map by importing a file or you can just change

17
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.879
the settings and create the landscape yourself.

18
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:32.000
Now I'm going to hit the Create button to create it.

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.120
And that will then create the mesh.

20
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.959
And we'll see where the cursor is.

21
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.519
We now have a blush.

22
00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.000
You'll see that we come onto the center tab.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.519
It's part of it that's called Sculpt.

24
00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:52.039
This will allow me to use the left-hand mouse button to sculpt the landscape.

25
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.240
I can hold down Shift and that will make the landscape go down.

26
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.520
It will allow me to create a landscape.

27
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.920
There are also a number of other brushes that are available to you.

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160
For example, erosion.

29
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.319
This will try and simulate physics to how mountains would erode over time,

30
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.759
giving you a more realistic look.

31
00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.759
That looks quite good.

32
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.840
Now there's only so far you can go with sculpting the landscape

33
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.840
before you're going to need a material to be attached to it.

34
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.879
So I have a very simple material already set up in this example.

35
00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.399
So I'm just going to add that.

36
00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.399
Now I'm going to come onto the third tab for Paint.

37
00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.919
And it has the material applied.

38
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.239
So I'm going to go create layers from the assigned material.

39
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.280
And I have to also create some supporting files.

40
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.640
So this gives me two different layers which I can now paint with.

41
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.680
So for example, I have a very simple grass which I'm going to cover most of this with.

42
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.280
And

43
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:17.800
I could also paint in a mud layer.

44
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
So we create a muddy section down the center here.

45
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.000
Now this is very simple.

46
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.879
Good landscape materials would look a lot better.

47
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.479
This just sort of demonstrates the workflow.

48
00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.599
So that is landscape.

49
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.240
It allows us to sculpt a landscape and gives us the option to paint it

50
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.800
inside the texture.

51
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.080
To complement landscape, we have the foliage tool.

52
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.560
Now what the foliage tool does is rather than in selection where you manually place a static mesh

53
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.040
actor, the foliage allows you to paint foliage onto a landscape.

54
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.840
So you can paint multiple meshes and they'll use something called static mesh instances.

55
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.800
Which are more optimized than a static mesh.

56
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.639
As far as demonstrating this quickly by one that I previously made using the trees.

57
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.680
And select that, you can now see that I can paint the trees onto our landscape

58
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.240
just by using a brush.

59
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.680
This is a lot quicker and more optimized and manually inserted.

60
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.560
Next up, I'd like to have a look at the modeling tool.

61
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.360
And what the modeling tool does is this gives us functionality within the engine

62
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.720
that you would expect to find in a modeling program such as Maya or Blender.

63
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920
Now we can create meshes.

64
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.240
We can change their UVs.

65
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.000
We can bake textures.

66
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.879
We can remesh them and do a lot of things inside here.

67
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.120
It is a quick demonstration.

68
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.839
This I've created a box.

69
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.360
And I'm coming into the modeling tool.

70
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:27.959
Select the main face and then select insert will allow me to create an insert except.

71
00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:36.919
And now I'm going to extrude the middle, push in and accept that.

72
00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:46.599
So now I have created a mesh box which is has an inside open.

73
00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.039
But just shows you how you can quickly create models or adapt models inside of the engine.

74
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.560
Next up, I'd like to show you the fracture tool.

75
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.760
Well, what this is is this works with our physics engine called chaos

76
00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:10.680
that allows us to do things like destroy boxes and create realistic explosions and build some things.

77
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.280
So let me quickly look at this.

78
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.400
So what I'm going to do is I've selected the box.

79
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.840
I'm going to add new geometry collection.

80
00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.560
And I'm going to then fracture this geometry collection like this.

81
00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:33.399
Push fracture and see if I push change the explosion amount.

82
00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.159
We can see how this is going to smash up.

83
00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.639
So we've got our fractured box.

84
00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:50.039
I'm now going to just drag this higher up, rotate it slightly on one edge.

85
00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:54.599
I'm going to select the geometry collection.

86
00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.599
Change the damage threshold so it's very low.

87
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:20.200
So you can see that this box has broken as it's broken.

88
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.400
Now again, this can get a lot more complicated and you can make a lot more impressive

89
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.760
explosions and destruction that it all comes under that mode for fracture.

90
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.439
The other modes that we haven't touched on include mesh paint.

91
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.199
Mesh paint allows us to paint onto a mesh into the vertex data

92
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:42.199
and then use that within materials.

93
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.599
Brush editing.

94
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.000
This is useful for gray boxing out level.

95
00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:51.480
And animation.

96
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.360
So this mode gives us some supporting tools to use with our sequencer model

97
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.159
that will allow us to do things like this.

98
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.920
That will allow us to create and bake out animations.

99
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.200
Thank you for sticking with us there.

100
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.480
Those recovered all of the modes.

101
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.640
In our next video, we're going to be looking at some of the other

102
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.400
features that are offered inside Unreal Engine.
