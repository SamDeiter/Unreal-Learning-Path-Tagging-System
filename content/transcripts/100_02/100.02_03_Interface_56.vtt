00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello and welcome to this next video where we will be looking at the interface and

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.720
looking at some basic controls.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.760
Now in the previous video we've created a project, I've just jumped into it here.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.760
You should be confronted with a screen that looks a little bit like this.

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.560
If you've previously used it, you might get a slightly different layout,

6
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.559
but all the elements are going to effectively be there.

7
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.560
So let's go through the sections piece by piece.

8
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.560
The first thing we have up the top here is our menu bar.

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.560
For this menu bar functions like most other menu bars and applications.

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.560
There will be different menus that will open up and allow you control over the project.

11
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.560
One thing that is worth noting is windows.

12
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:02.560
The reason windows is specifically interesting is because if you are missing any of the other windows that we talk about,

13
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.560
you'll find that you can switch them on or off here.

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.560
For example, if you were missing a details panel, you could come in here, tick on,

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
and this would open up a new details panel for you.

16
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.560
So this is just interesting because if I reference some kind of menu and you can't find it,

17
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560
it will usually be because it's not turned on here.

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.560
The second part is across the top here. This is our tool bar.

19
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.560
Now this is going to have a number of different selections.

20
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.560
The first one is save. This will save the current level.

21
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
It will save the layout of the level you have in front of you to disk.

22
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.560
It won't have anything else, so they'll just save the current level,

23
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.560
but it will mean anything that you've moved around will be saved.

24
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
It will also have browse.

25
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.560
Now this is all over the engine as we use it.

26
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
It allows us to browse within a content browser.

27
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Now if you click on it, you'll see there brings up content browser,

28
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.560
and it automatically highlights, in this case, the level.

29
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
So that's a good example.

30
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560
We'll talk about the content browser as we'll learn later on.

31
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
Next up, all we have is the mode.

32
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.560
We are at the moment in selection mode,

33
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.560
and we will look at a couple of the other modes as we're going on.

34
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.560
Next we have add, quickly add to the project.

35
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.560
And what this is going to do is this is going to give us some options

36
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.560
to either import, get content.

37
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.560
It allows to brooring content in from other places,

38
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.560
such as the fab store or Cooksville bridge,

39
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
or just manually import from files.

40
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.560
It will also allow us to place different actors within the level.

41
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560
An actor is a reference to anything which is in the level.

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.560
For example, if I was to come up here and select a shape, sphere,

43
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.560
you can see that it adds this sphere to all of them.

44
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.560
Next to that, we also have a couple of other options.

45
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560
We're not going to touch on these in a moment,

46
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560
but here we have the play button.

47
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.560
If I was to press play,

48
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
you would see that our character is generalized into the world.

49
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.560
We are able to run the application or gain inside the editor.

50
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.560
We'll touch on that a bit more later as well.

51
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560
In the center we have the viewport,

52
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.560
and this is the visual representation of the level or world that we're working on.

53
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.560
We'll go over this in detail in a minute.

54
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.560
On the right-hand side, we have the outliner.

55
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560
Now, what the outliner is, is a list of all of the different

56
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.560
actors. We reference actors, but actors means anything that is inside the level.

57
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560
As you'll see down here, some of them have a visual element to them,

58
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
some of them just exist in space.

59
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
If I was to come in here and select, say for example, a cylinder,

60
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560
and if I was to press P.

61
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.560
You would see that this cylinder has a representation in the world,

62
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.560
and it is also as a part of the list in the outliner.

63
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.560
This is very useful for us to be able to find and select things accordingly.

64
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.560
Finally, down in the bottom here, we have a details panel.

65
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.560
Now, what the details panel is, is a contextual menu.

66
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.560
So, say for example, I select something within the scene or the outliner.

67
00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.560
It will bring up all of the details for that selected object.

68
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
Now, this again, the details panel is something which we are going to see

69
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.560
all over the engine, all of the different menus.

70
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560
It's always pretty much contextual.

71
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.560
So, whatever you have selected at any one point, it will have,

72
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.560
it will give you the options that are connected to that.

73
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.560
Now, let's have a bit of a deeper dive into our viewport.

74
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.560
Now, for the viewport, first thing you'll want to know is how to move around.

75
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.560
And I believe these are the most common ways of moving around.

76
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.560
If you are to hold down the right-hand mouse button, then use the W, S, A and D.

77
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.560
W moves forward, S backwards, A and D would strafe left or right.

78
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560
That will allow you to move in the works.

79
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.560
And those will be in reference to the camera viewport.

80
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.560
Holding down the right-hand mouse button is going to mean that you can control the viewport.

81
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.560
I'll demonstrate that in a second.

82
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.560
We also have two more keys that allow you to go up and down.

83
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.560
And that is Q and E, again, with the right-hand mouse button down.

84
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.560
But the F key will allow you to focus on a selected actor.

85
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.560
You can see I tried that out a little bit earlier.

86
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.560
It allows you to jump and just focus on a single actor.

87
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.560
Finally, we have Alt and Left Click.

88
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.560
And this will allow you to orbit a selected actor.

89
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.560
Let's jump into the engine and try those.

90
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.560
So again, in this case, what I've done is I've held down the right-hand mouse button.

91
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.560
Now you'll see as I move the mouse, I can move the angle of the camera,

92
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.560
which is being used in the viewport.

93
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:02.560
And if I push W, I'll go forward, S backwards, A left, D right.

94
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.560
This will allow you to navigate and move around.

95
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.560
If you're used to playing computer games, this will feel quite natural for you.

96
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.560
Next up, we have from holding down the right-hand mouse button.

97
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
If I push Q, it will send me down.

98
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:31.560
Here, that's to increase or lower the altitude of the cone.

99
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.560
Finally, F.

100
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.560
Though if I was to select, say, this cylinder inside the level,

101
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.560
whereas if I was to press F, it would frame focus on that cylinder.

102
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:55.560
If I was to select something else, press F, it would move me directly.

103
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.560
The sphere that we brought in is a really useful way to very quickly get to an object.

104
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:11.560
We also do the same thing by selecting something inside the outline, pressing F to focus.

105
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.560
Now if we come back and focus on our sphere,

106
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.560
I hold down in this time the left-hand's button and hold.

107
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:28.560
Then as I move the mouse, I'm going to orbit that specific actor.

108
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:36.559
It's going to allow me to get the correct angle I want to get from it.

109
00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.559
Another button that's worth knowing about is the mouse wheel.

110
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:48.559
It's going to allow you to zoom in and zoom out.

111
00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:51.559
Now when you're working on levels, levels can get quite big.

112
00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:57.559
And you might want to move between common places multiple times.

113
00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:03.559
You don't want to have to spend your whole time running around trying to find a specific angle.

114
00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:07.559
So for this, we have a bookmarking system.

115
00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:13.559
And how a bookmarking system works is if you find a specific location,

116
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:20.559
say for example, I'm viewing here, I hold down control and one.

117
00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.559
And then I also want one that views from above.

118
00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:26.559
Move up here and press control and two.

119
00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:32.559
Now if I push one, I will jump to the bookmark location and two, I will jump back to the other one.

120
00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:41.559
So this is a really useful way to be able to jump between different points in the engine.

121
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:45.559
So again, to reiterate that in the bookmarking system,

122
00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:51.559
if you just hold down the control and number key from zero to nine,

123
00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:59.559
you can bookmark a location and you can then push zero to nine in order to jump to that location.

124
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:04.559
Because very useful as your levels get larger.

125
00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:09.559
Next up, let's have a look at the options that we have across the top here.

126
00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:16.559
So to start with, we have this element here, which is the camera speed.

127
00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:25.559
This will allow you to speed up and slow down the camera as you move around the world.

128
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:29.559
It is also connected to the middle mouse button.

129
00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:38.559
So if you hold down the right mouse button, you can scroll in order to speed up and slow down the cap.

130
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:43.559
And this again is really useful if you want to get a very specific angle.

131
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:48.559
You can get close by going fast.

132
00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:55.559
And then you can reduce the speed so that you can get absolutely perfect.

133
00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:59.559
So this is the speed of the camera.

134
00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:04.559
We also have a couple of other options here under this dropdown.

135
00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:10.559
So it's going to allow us stuff like, for example, we can change the field of view, the near plane,

136
00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:18.559
and some of the camera options going to game view.

137
00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:23.559
And right at the bottom here, we're able to take a screenshot.

138
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.559
You'll also see that we have some orthographic options.

139
00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:29.559
For example, we can come into top view.

140
00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:33.559
Then we get something that looks like this.

141
00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:38.559
Now you'll notice when we move into top view or orthographic,

142
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:42.559
we are locked into one axis.

143
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:46.559
Well, you'll also notice that this has gone wire-free.

144
00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:49.559
Now it brings me to the menu that's right of this.

145
00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.559
This gives us a number of different view mode settings.

146
00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:55.559
By default, we would be on lit.

147
00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:59.559
That's going to give us the bioframe from above like this.

148
00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:07.559
However, we also have pun-lit, which is just going to give us the albedo or the base color pass.

149
00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:14.559
Wireframe is very useful so that we can tell where objects are.

150
00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:23.559
We have the lit wireframe as well, which will give us a combination of the wireframe and the models beneath it.

151
00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:31.559
And there are lots of other ones to look through, far too much for us to go over in this instance.

152
00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:37.559
You could also select bottom left, right, right, front.

153
00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:40.559
I'm going to go back to perspective.

154
00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:45.559
And that brings us to a logical point to stop or the interface.

155
00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:51.559
We've looked at the different windows that were connected up and we've learned how to move about.

156
00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:58.559
In the next video, we're going to look about bringing assets into the editor.

157
00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:04.559
Thank you for watching.
