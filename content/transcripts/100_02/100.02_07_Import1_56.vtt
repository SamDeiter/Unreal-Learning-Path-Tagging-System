00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello and welcome to this video on importing assets.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.200
For this we're going to be going over the different ways that we can get assets into

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Unreal Engine.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.879
Well, there are multiple different ways to get assets into Unreal Engine and we're not

5
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.120
going to be going over each of them in depth.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.560
We'll only do the main ones but I'll just mention them here so that you are aware of

7
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:32.399
them for future research.

8
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.719
So first of all there's manual importing and we're going to be demonstrating this with

9
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:46.679
an FBX former file that you might get from Blender or Maya or some other software.

10
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.840
Also there is the fab integration.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360
Fab is our asset and art store.

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.600
This has a ton of different assets available in it and Unreal is heavily integrated into

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
it.

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.879
So it's really straightforward to buy assets or get assets from the store and then just

15
00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:13.439
import them directly into projects.

16
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.439
Datasmith.

17
00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.719
Now Datasmith we will not be going over in this.

18
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:27.840
Datasmith is a tool designed for primarily people like architects where rather than importing

19
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:38.519
in a singular asset such as a car or a character or something you would import an entire scene

20
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:44.400
and you'd want to be able to keep the settings of the scene like where all the lights are

21
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.359
and where all the different assets are placed in their transforms.

22
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:55.120
So it's really useful for workflow where you're building your scenes in another asset and

23
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.560
you want to import them into Unreal.

24
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.640
We'll be touching on migration and just as a concept really but if you want to move files

25
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.080
between projects, migration allows you to move them across and keep all of the references

26
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.560
intact so that they work when you when you've imported.

27
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560
Finally Quixel.

28
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.720
Quixel is a service that we have where we have photo, geometry, high res models and

29
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.720
textures.

30
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.800
Now these are all pretty much integrated now with the fab store.

31
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.920
However, before we do this, let's talk about something that's called plugins.

32
00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:44.359
Now plugins are a method of adding things to a project.

33
00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.679
Now when you set up a project and you pick a template, a number of different plugins

34
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:56.159
are automatically going to be enabled and placed into that project.

35
00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.879
Now there are a bunch which are very, very standard and there are a bunch that are a

36
00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.560
lot more niche.

37
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Unreal has a ton of different plugins that are available, but you can also get lots of

38
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.719
other plugins from the stores or you can create your own plugins in order as a method

39
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.120
to easily transfer things between projects.

40
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.319
So let's jump into the engine here and see how you might go about adding a plugin to

41
00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.520
a project.

42
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.400
If I was to come up to the edit window, you can see at the bottom here we have an option

43
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.880
for plugins.

44
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.000
If I click on that, it's going to give me a list of all of the different plugins which

45
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.840
are available in your version of the engine.

46
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.520
Now some of them will be selected and ticked on as you can see here.

47
00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.040
However, there are a ton more which are not selected.

48
00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:13.719
Now if I was, for example, to type in Niagara, Niagara is our article system which has a

49
00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.800
whole load of different great elements that are part of it.

50
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.759
You can see that there are a load of plugins which are specific to Niagara.

51
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.959
Niagara itself is usually turned on by default, it's used a lot in the engine.

52
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.439
There is also one here called Niagara Fluids.

53
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:38.319
If I was to tick that, it would warn me that this is in a beta version.

54
00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:45.240
Now what Unreal will do is they will release all of the plugins and all of the different

55
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.759
functionality usually first in a beta version.

56
00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.799
Don't let beta turn you off too much because you're going to find that a lot of the engine

57
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.879
is perpetually in beta.

58
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.399
A hell of a lot of this is stuff that we're already shipping in games such as Fortnite.

59
00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:10.800
So don't just ignore things because they're in the beta.

60
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.279
I'm going to click Yes and at the bottom here it's going to ask me to restart.

61
00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.959
So I will restart and now this is restarted back up.

62
00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.719
I'm going to close this down.

63
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.400
It took me a little bit of time to find it but I've navigated to the plugin Niagara

64
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400
Fluid content.

65
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000
It's got a couple of templates here.

66
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.600
So I'm going to drag this into the world.

67
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:46.160
Now you can now see that we have a fluid simulation going on inside the world.

68
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.640
Now I was just giving this as a demonstration of how you can use a plugin in order to get

69
00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.560
extra functionality or to add in different assets into your C.

70
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.720
That's just one of the examples that come with it.

71
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.200
Now you may find in the Fudge Store when we come to that that there will be asset packs

72
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.080
which are offered as plugins.

73
00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:23.240
And what it will allow you to do is download them and add them to your engine version and

74
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.560
then they will be available in the list of plugins.

75
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.839
Next up we have add feature or content pack.

76
00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:39.199
Now this is useful because all of the different templates have different features and content

77
00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.959
packs and these are available to be added to any other project.

78
00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.959
So let me show you.

79
00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:55.279
So at the moment we are in the third person template.

80
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.639
Now the third person template doesn't have any guns in it.

81
00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.439
They say I wanted to bring in a gun.

82
00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.120
I know that one exists in the first person.

83
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:14.040
If I come up to add and come up to add feature or content pack you can now see that I could

84
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.480
come over to the first person template and I could add this to the project.

85
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.639
We have a couple other options as well.

86
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.959
Here is the start of content.

87
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.280
If you didn't select the start of content at the beginning you always add it to a project

88
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280
here.

89
00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:33.159
If I add the first person add to the project.

90
00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:39.839
So it's going to import the directory for the first person.

91
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:46.559
Now you can see I've got the first person as a directory and inside of the blueprints

92
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:55.359
we have my search for weapon.

93
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.480
You can see that we now have a whole load of different options when it comes to weapons.

94
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.000
So for example I've got the grenade launcher.

95
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.520
I can just drag into the scene.

96
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520
That's going to bring that.

97
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.360
It will also bring everything else that comes with it.

98
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.280
So we'll have a whole load of combinations that can be used for shooting and a whole

99
00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:25.559
load of other special effects that are specific to the first person.

100
00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:32.039
Our next option is to add content and add.

101
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:39.759
Now add is our store and I'm just going to show you quickly how you would go about adding

102
00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:42.879
the content.

103
00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:48.919
Now I'm back in the epic launcher and if you scroll down at the bottom of it you're going

104
00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:53.080
to find something that says fablib.

105
00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:02.519
These are all of the different tracks that I have acquired from the fab store over the

106
00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.519
years.

107
00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:09.919
If I click to visit the fab store it's going to bring me to a store that looks like this.

108
00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:17.679
Now I have connected this to my epic account and at any point I can now come in here and

109
00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.279
I can purchase or search for stuff.

110
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:29.639
You'll find that we don't just offer for Unreal Engine but we also offer it for Unity and Unreal

111
00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.959
Editor for Fortnite.

112
00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:36.480
Everything is broken down like you do in a standard asset shop.

113
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.200
You can see things by categories or by specific channels.

114
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:48.840
Now you'll find that at any one point we usually have a number of assets for free.

115
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.399
At the moment we have the warehouse environment, where Wolf and the spine plug-in that could

116
00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:57.480
all be purchased for free.

117
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.480
These are already in my library as you can see.

118
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.120
However, there are a ton of stuff that is permanently free on here and so if I was to

119
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.480
come into Unreal Engine, verify the look for 3D models.

120
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.159
I can sort by price.

121
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.360
I can just select free.

122
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.360
This is going to provide me with a whole load of free assets.

123
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.480
Now these are permanently free.

124
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.080
Some of them are from Epic but there are a ton of them here.

125
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.879
So it's a great place to start.

126
00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:43.120
Once you've purchased one of these, once you've grabbed one, you've chosen, you've

127
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.440
added it to your library, you'll then find that it appears within the launcher.

128
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.360
So once you've purchased it and it shows up in your launcher, you can refresh to get

129
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.240
any new items that are coming in.

130
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.520
There is going to be a list that looks something like this.

131
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:08.439
Now you'll notice that on these yellow buttons, there are a couple of different options.

132
00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:15.639
There is either the add to a project, there is create a project, or there is install into

133
00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:18.000
the engine.

134
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.639
Now if, for example, something that requires creating a project, this needs to create its

135
00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:29.840
own project, you'll then need to migrate the assets that you want over into the project

136
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840
that you're looking at.

137
00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:34.960
We'll show you quickly how to do that.

138
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:43.320
But if it says add to a project, so for example, I have a blank and a dash of the effects in

139
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.000
this one, this is compatible with our version of the engine.

140
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.200
I'm going to select add to a project, like in first project, add to the project.

141
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.040
And you can see that it is going to add it in here.

142
00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:05.279
Now bear in mind, if you can see that it has this little yellow element here, that means

143
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:08.000
it's downloaded onto your computer.

144
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.480
You can see that my entire FAB library is 58 dig.

145
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.719
So you have to be careful.

146
00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:20.559
If you don't want one, you can just remove the local content, but it can get big.

147
00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:27.639
So now that I've imported it, you can see that we have a blank and dash of the effects.

148
00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:33.360
If I jump in here, I can add the effect to the level.

149
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.759
Yeah, see that effect is already there.

150
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.159
So it's as quick as that.

151
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:44.960
You can just really quickly just add in effects from the store.

152
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:52.799
Just a question of downloading it and dragging it in and all of the assets of that.

153
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:56.479
That brings us to the end of our first session on importing assets.

154
00:12:56.479 --> 00:13:00.559
Next up, we're going to go over the other methods you can use.
