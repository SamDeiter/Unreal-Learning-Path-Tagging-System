00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello and welcome to the next video on the interface.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
This time we're going to look at how you can manipulate

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.800
and move actors around a scene.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.359
Okay, so we're back in the editor now.

5
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.300
And before we start moving actors around,

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.140
let's add in a primitive or a shape

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.359
that we can see it slightly better on.

8
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.920
I'm gonna come over here

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.039
and I'm gonna come up to the add, the quickly add to project.

10
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm gonna come down and I will search for shapes.

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.439
I'm gonna select the cube.

12
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.480
That's gonna create a cube in front of me here.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.359
And I'll focus on that cube.

14
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.520
Bye, so we have a cube.

15
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.280
Now, you probably don't see this widget if you just come in

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.200
and that's because you'd be in selection mode.

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.600
If you look around, move stuff around,

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.879
you can see that in selection mode, there are no widgets,

19
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:10.879
but we do have a clear frame in order to select things.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.520
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come up

21
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.000
to the top left-hand corner here.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760
And you can see in this,

23
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.760
we have a blue highlighted select object.

24
00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.439
And next to it, we have another three options.

25
00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.439
So if I select the second one, which is translate,

26
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.760
you'll now be able to see that we get this widget

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.319
with these three axes pins.

28
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.400
And if you'd notice down in the details panel,

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.400
we have a location here.

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.640
And if I was to move the location,

31
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.520
it's going to change the location of the object.

32
00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:57.039
Also, if I was to change the rotation,

33
00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.879
it's gonna change the rotation too.

34
00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.759
And scale, I'll be able to scale it up and down

35
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.119
on different axes.

36
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000
And that is not the easiest way to do this.

37
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.439
It's far easier to do it within the editor itself

38
00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.759
in the viewport.

39
00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.719
So in translation mode,

40
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.560
you can see that I can now move the actor

41
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.640
on any one of the specific axes.

42
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.439
And if I was to come in closer,

43
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.439
you can see that I have a square between two of the axes.

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.400
And all this would do is you'll only move it

45
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.879
on the two selected axes.

46
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.520
So I'm left clicking and dragging it around.

47
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.000
And this is useful if you want to sort of move something

48
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.840
on the wall or on the floor.

49
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.879
You also select the center,

50
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.840
which is gonna move it,

51
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.560
it's slightly consistent with the camera itself.

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.599
I don't use that very much.

53
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.159
But that is the translate mode.

54
00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.439
It's gonna allow us to move the location

55
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.840
of the actor itself.

56
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.240
Next up, we have the rotate.

57
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.520
And this is gonna give us a slightly different widget.

58
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.360
It's going to give us a widget still with three axes.

59
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.120
It's gonna allow us to move it

60
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.719
on any of these specific axes.

61
00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.520
Now it's to rotate it in space accordingly.

62
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.200
There's not the option to select two axes within this.

63
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.320
Turn it to normal.

64
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.520
Final one is scale.

65
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.640
And again, with scale,

66
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.639
we can just select one of the specific axes, X, Y, Z.

67
00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.039
Or we can select two by going on the triangle in the middle

68
00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:58.359
that allow us to scale on the lock one of the axes.

69
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.399
Or we can select the middle,

70
00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.000
which will allow us to uniformly scale the whole thing.

71
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.599
Now, we've manually clicked on the different

72
00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.400
select object elements here.

73
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.599
However, that is not necessary

74
00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.160
because we have them on hotkeys.

75
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.759
And the hotkeys will be the first four buttons

76
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.399
in the top left-hand corner of a QWERTY keyboard.

77
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:30.040
So Q is selection mode, W is translate,

78
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.400
E is rotate and R is scale.

79
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.240
So you can quickly slip between these

80
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.040
by just clicking on the buttons.

81
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.800
So just to reiterate there,

82
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.600
in order to move them around,

83
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.200
the Q will give us the just select object,

84
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.640
W will give us the translate,

85
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.640
E will give us the rotate and R would give us the rotate.

86
00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.240
And R would give us the scale.

87
00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.839
Next up, let's have a look at these three buttons on top.

88
00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.599
You may have noticed, as I've been moving things,

89
00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.399
it's very hard to see,

90
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.759
that they are moving in increments.

91
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.039
So the moment I have this set of things,

92
00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.959
they're snapping in increments.

93
00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.919
Increments start off as quite small,

94
00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.319
so it's a little bit hard to see,

95
00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.959
but if I was to use the drop down here

96
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.560
and select a larger increment,

97
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.359
you'd see that it is snapping in a larger increment.

98
00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.719
Now we have three of these,

99
00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.319
one for translation, rotation and scale.

100
00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.120
And you can see next to each of them,

101
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.919
we have a drop down that determines our increments.

102
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.120
So I would, if I can come into this,

103
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.960
I've set it to 60 increments, so for rotation,

104
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.640
you'd see that it rotates in large increments like this.

105
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.759
And for scale, I'm gonna set it to one,

106
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.439
so if we were to change the scale,

107
00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.160
it's going to move up in quite large increments.

108
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.960
Now you might not always want this,

109
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.600
so if you want to turn this off,

110
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.000
you can just click on any of these.

111
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.080
The moment they're highlighted as on,

112
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.720
because they're in blue,

113
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.320
if I was to turn them off, for example,

114
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.920
let's do that on rotation,

115
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.360
now we can freely rotate.

116
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.080
Come that's exactly the same for scale and translation.

117
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.240
So that is snapping.

118
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.840
The increments are below,

119
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.679
you can go into edit to preferences

120
00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:56.079
and change the increments if you specifically need them.

121
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.919
We're talking about translation,

122
00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.039
the unreal units are centimeters.

123
00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.279
Another hot key that's worth knowing

124
00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.559
is if I was to grab this

125
00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.079
and press the end key,

126
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.639
that's going to drop it to the ground.

127
00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:24.560
So it just uses the collision to figure out

128
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.279
where things are or drop it to the ground at that point.

129
00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:34.519
Now we have looked at adding actors

130
00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:37.559
to your scene by using the add button

131
00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:39.639
in the top left hand corner.

132
00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.759
And in the next video,

133
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.599
we're going to be looking at using the content browser.

134
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:46.559
However, there is one other method

135
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.519
that I'd like to bring up whilst I'm here.

136
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.519
And that is if you were to hold down the alt P

137
00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:59.519
whilst moving or changing the transform of an object,

138
00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:03.839
rather than changing the translation of the object,

139
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.839
it is going to duplicate the actor itself.

140
00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.680
And this tends to be one of the quickest ways

141
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.399
to add an extra actor,

142
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:15.719
especially if you already have one in scene.

143
00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:16.639
It's a very quick way.

144
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.919
And you can see this will work for Penny or the,

145
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.360
or any of the actors that exist in the scene,

146
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.800
even if they are not static meshes

147
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.919
that we have at this point.

148
00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:32.279
Okay, and that brings us to the end of our interface section

149
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.919
on manipulating actors within the scene.

150
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.080
In the next video,

151
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.559
we're going to look at using the content browser.
