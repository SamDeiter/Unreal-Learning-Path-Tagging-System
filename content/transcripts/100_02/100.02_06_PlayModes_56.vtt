00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
Hello and welcome to the last video in about interfaces.

2
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.540
And in this, I'm just going to be going into a little bit more detail about the play option

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.160
in the editor.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.080
Okay, so here we are back in the editor, and I have added in three cubes, which are set

5
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
to rotate.

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.560
Don't worry about too much about how I've done it.

7
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:32.679
It's just so that we can see when the game is running and when it is not.

8
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.600
Now what I want to look at is the different play options that we have.

9
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.759
So you can see up here with our standard play, if we were to hit normal play, here would

10
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:50.280
default at the moment to playing it within the editor window.

11
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.359
Now I could push F11 to make this full screen.

12
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.799
That's fine, it just runs within the editor window.

13
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.120
Now if I press escape, that's going to bring me out of it.

14
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.039
Now it's set to play an editor, but we have a couple of options.

15
00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:14.319
So first option that we have is still play an editor, and that's what play means, but

16
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.319
it will do it in a separate window.

17
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.199
And this is useful if you want it running, so that you can make changes next to it.

18
00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.039
It's exactly the same thing.

19
00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.119
And again, escape will let you come out of it.

20
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.839
And you'll see that this has now changed the default to be playing a new window.

21
00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:38.359
As we swap between the models, they will sit as a default.

22
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.959
The next one that I want to look at is a standalone game.

23
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:51.479
And this is interesting because what it does is it fires up as if it was a compiled packaged

24
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.479
game.

25
00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.519
Now it obviously won't be as compiled as if it had gone through the packaging, but you

26
00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.479
can see it had to load the shaders there.

27
00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.479
And this runs independently.

28
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.039
Now in this case, escape will not work, because that's an editor function.

29
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:19.319
Escape within the actual game is going to be something you'd have to code in yourself.

30
00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.719
So I'm just going to manually kill it.

31
00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.799
Now the final option I want you to be aware of is called simulate.

32
00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.599
And what simulate does is it will not spawn the pawn that you have attached to the game.

33
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.560
It'll actually spawn something called a spectator pawn.

34
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.240
And this is going to allow you to move around the world and see how the games function it.

35
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.920
So if you have things like NPCs, they would run around, but it'll allow you to just check

36
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.360
and see what's going on without having to be spawned as a character.

37
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.400
And that's really useful.

38
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.240
You'll also have this option here where you can press F8.

39
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.000
All that it's going to do is that's going to now spawn the character and allow you to

40
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.680
move around.

41
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.960
So those are your main options.

42
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.560
So just to clarify that, we have a number of options here.

43
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.319
You have the selected viewport, which is the default one.

44
00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.039
The new editor window is going to create a new editor window and still allow you to see

45
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.080
this viewport behind it.

46
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.479
Standalone game, which runs it as a separate app.

47
00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:39.959
And finally, we have simulate, which will play in the editor with a spectator pawn for

48
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:40.959
free movement.

49
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.039
Also, I just want to iterate some of the hotkeys.

50
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:51.679
If you press Alt plus P, it will start the play mode that you have selected.

51
00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.439
Here in time.

52
00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.560
If you press F8, it will switch between the spectator pawn and the player pawn.

53
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.399
And finally, escape is going to end.

54
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.000
This will only work in the editor play modes.

55
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.080
And with that, that will bring us to the end of the interface sections.

56
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.759
We can now move on to have a look at importing assets into Unreal.
