00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello, and welcome to the last video in this course.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.339
For this, we're just going to be going over some final points to sort of round out your

3
00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:18.160
understanding of the engine and to give you a good idea of what your next steps or what

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.039
you would like to learn about next is to fit your personal workflow.

5
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.359
So for this, I'd like to start with coding.

6
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.280
Unreal Engine works with a number of different languages when it comes to coding, but the

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.159
main two are C++ and our visual scripting language, Blueprints.

8
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.759
Unreal Engine is built in C++.

9
00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.600
It is a very fast and powerful programming language, and it allows you to organize your

10
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.320
code into a reusable component, which is excellent for optimizing things like game performance.

11
00:00:53.759 --> 00:01:00.560
Underneath Unreal is built in this language, but it is not a necessity to learn this in

12
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.880
order to use Unreal Engine.

13
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200
That's where Blueprints goes in, so we're going to talk about.

14
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.799
As we mentioned, when creating a project, you can select it to be an either Blueprints

15
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.680
or C++.

16
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
It doesn't matter terribly, but if you're in C++, you are going to have to work with

17
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.120
an IE, such as Visual Studio.

18
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.079
So C++, very powerful, compiles down to be very fast, but it is a complicated programming

19
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.120
language and there is a bit of a barrier to entry that you have to learn how to program.

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.280
It also isn't directly in the editor, which means once you compile something, you're

21
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.320
still going to have to go back into the editor in order to implement its usage.

22
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.960
Blueprints are our visual scripting language.

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.479
This was added to the engine quite a while ago.

24
00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.799
When it was clear on computer games, you tend to have a lot of creative, non-coding people,

25
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.280
stuff like level designers and artists, that you would still like to expose some of the

26
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.639
power of the code to.

27
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:18.879
It is in a visual plug and play setup, allowing you to place nodes down, and it is much quicker

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.159
to learn and to get up and rolling.

29
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:30.400
As far as powerful, it does actually compile down to be C++, so when a program is packaged,

30
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.159
it can be pretty much as fast and it's often not the coding which will be your bottleneck.

31
00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.680
But the other excellent thing about this is because it's in editor, it's very quick to

32
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.000
make code changes and see them reflected within the editor sort of immediately, which is great

33
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.639
for an artist's workflow, even though it might not be as fast as C++.

34
00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.960
It is fast enough that many, many computer games have been released almost entirely in

35
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.360
Blueprints, so it is powerful enough for you to release something as a program.

36
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.680
Just going to show this in the engine quickly.

37
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.000
As you can see here, I've got a third person character.

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
If I drag this into the world, it looks like this.

39
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.439
If I was to also open this up, who would open up and it would show us the Blueprint coding

40
00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.280
language here.

41
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.639
So we can see that it has a number of functions such as being able to jump when a specific

42
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.520
key is being pushed.

43
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.879
And so this is where we would find it in something that's called an actor or a Blueprint.

44
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.879
Of course, but we can also find that we have an equivalent in the level Blueprint.

45
00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.319
So this would allow us to code stuff into a specific level.

46
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.039
Or we could find them all across the engine.

47
00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:02.280
Most of the elements of the engine have Blueprints attached to them.

48
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.719
And this is why it is something that's really important to learn.

49
00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.039
Even if you are not a coder, it is worth knowing the basics of Blueprints because it really

50
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:19.639
can be a force multiplier on whatever your workflow it is from animation to rendering

51
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.040
to materials.

52
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.199
Blueprints touch almost every part of the engine.

53
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.279
Even though it is a coding language, I do recommend you learn a little bit of it.

54
00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.480
It's easier than you'd imagine.

55
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.199
And it is incredibly powerful no matter what your role is.

56
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600
Next up, we have Sequencer.

57
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.560
Now Sequencer allows us to use a timeline to control what's going on within the engine.

58
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:59.160
Now this is most commonly used for things such as cinematics or rendering out animations.

59
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.120
But it can be used for a lot of different things within the engine.

60
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.560
And it's whenever you want something to be controlled over a timeline.

61
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.800
As a quick demonstration of how Sequencer would work, there is a flapper board icon

62
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.600
pop on the toolbar here.

63
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.319
I always press that and select Add a Level Sequence.

64
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.079
It's going to ask me to save something.

65
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:31.639
But after I do that, it will bring up a Sequence panel like this.

66
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:43.000
Now if there was to find a Skeletal Mesh, I'm just going to search for Skeletal Mesh.

67
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.199
And I'm going to bring him the Manny and rotate him to place the camera.

68
00:05:51.199 --> 00:06:00.279
I was to go back to my Sequence and add him, selection from Content Browser.

69
00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.039
You can see that we would get something that's called the Control Rig Rotom.

70
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.199
This is something that needs to be set up.

71
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.000
But it allows me to do stuff such as very simple animations.

72
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.839
And I can get a lot better.

73
00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.239
And see if I start with the arm in the air here.

74
00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.879
Can I just key that?

75
00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.799
And then I will key it again over here.

76
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:52.559
And in the middle, I'll move his arm to the other side and key that.

77
00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.879
And now you can see we've got a very simple straightforward animation.

78
00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.759
I'm just doing that quickly to sort of demonstrate what it does.

79
00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:04.920
You can also add cameras in and then you can use the Movie Rendering Queue to render stuff out.

80
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.240
And the system gets incredibly complicated with different shots and stuff like that.

81
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.599
So it's very powerful.

82
00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.000
But this just gives you an idea of if you are looking to generate animations,

83
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.079
you really want to learn about Sequencer.

84
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:28.439
And that's where you're going to get that from.

85
00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:32.319
Finally, I'd like to talk about Materials.

86
00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.240
So Unreal runs with a PBR workbook,

87
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.399
which means we do something that's called physical-based rendering.

88
00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:45.720
You try and discern how light would interact with the surface

89
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.120
so that we can create something as realistic as possible.

90
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.240
Now, we create Materials.

91
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.079
And this is very similar to how it is done in a lot of other programs.

92
00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:04.039
As you can see here, I have filtered the Content Browser by Materials.

93
00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:08.279
If I just drag them in, lay some on here,

94
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.959
you can see that we get a very different effect

95
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:15.919
dependent on what material is added to our mesh.

96
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:21.799
Now, if I was to open up one of these Materials,

97
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.000
this would show us an example of a Material Graph.

98
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.600
But the main thing to know about a Material Graph is we have the Output here,

99
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.000
where what is plugged in to any of these settings

100
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.480
is going to determine how it looks.

101
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.360
So for example, we have the Base Color is going to determine the color.

102
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.759
Roughness is going to determine how much light is diffused off of a surface.

103
00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:55.279
So lower a Roughness, the more reflective it is,

104
00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.639
emissive will make it grow.

105
00:08:57.639 --> 00:09:02.600
Normal is going to fake geometry to add sort of shadow

106
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.960
and elements to something where we don't have the geometry.

107
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.759
And there are a number of other ones here.

108
00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.679
We are able to change the Material domain,

109
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:17.399
Blend Options and a whole load of other different elements.

110
00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:21.200
But in this case, we are plugging textures

111
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:28.400
into the Output, which would then be stretched across the Material

112
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.720
based on how we use it in the coordinates.

113
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.400
And this same workflow can be used for post-process Materials,

114
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.040
for magic effects, numerous different elements.

115
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.960
But again, if you're a technical artist or working Materials,

116
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.519
this would be where you'd go to put together your Materials.

117
00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:56.320
And with that, we have come to the end of our course.

118
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.000
Hopefully that has given you a good foundation

119
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.280
and allowed you to know what sort of things

120
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.040
you would like to go into more depth into.

121
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.040
Thank you very much.
