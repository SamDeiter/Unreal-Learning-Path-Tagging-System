  "text": " So reflection is at the heart of some of the functionality we just talked about. For anyone who's not familiar with the term reflection, you might be familiar with it if you're used to something like C sharp, it's code's ability to examine itself. C++ doesn't have any reflection capability at the moment. I know there's some discussion about reflection getting added in the C++26 standard or something like that. I'm not completely certain about that. But for now, Unreal has a reflection system that implements itself and that all stems from the U object. So U object is Unreal's kind of base type for anything that is really in relation to the engine and gameplay functionality. U object is kind of the base, the start of anything that can be reflected comes from U object. Any game object, any bullet, visual effect, sound, cue, anything in the class hierarchy, it all comes from U object as the base. It's important noting that U objects, anything that extends from U downwards is only accessible on the game thread. Their memory is automatically handled by Unreal, which implements garbage collection and U objects support serialization and all that means for saving and networking and stuff like that. So it's important to highlight that the U in U object is actually important. Unreal has kind of a strong and strict naming convention where if you try to break this, you will actually get compiler errors. Anything that is just a raw object, it starts with U. So anything that is just data is a U object. As soon as something exists in the world and has a position and can run around and do things, it's an actor. Actor inherits from U object and at that point we start using the A letter. So all your classes would start with A, my snazzy car. That's only in the C++ itself, in the actual solution explorer it would still be just called class E car or whatever. Structs and non U object classes have the prefix of F. Enums have the prefix of E and any templated types using generics start with T. So and again this is a strong convention that you'll get compiler errors about if you don't pay attention to it. The other thing about when introducing a class that uses this reflection system, there's a couple of things you need to do. First off, going chronological at the top to bottom of the file, is you would need a generated H include. So if you look at any class inside Unreal, you'll see there'll be a generated H include if it's a kind of reflected class type. But also it's important to highlight that this include will normally complain at you if it's not the last include in your include list. So if we just quickly jump to some code, we would see this in whenever you make a game mode, you'd see it here. Whenever you create an Unreal project, typically it creates a game mode class for you. So I haven't written this, it gets automatically generated and you can see it's got some simple includes and then it's got this generated include itself. We'd also have some kind of reflection markup. So if it's a class, then it would be headed with a U class markup macro. If it's a struct, it would have U struct above it and if it's an enum, it would have U enum. The last thing for U class and U struct is it would have generated body. So you'd see this here, any struct that is headed with U struct or any class that's headed with U class needs a generated body within it. Otherwise, again, the compiler will complain at you. It's worth highlighting as well that when creating a new class, you can actually create classes through the editor itself. You don't have to go through the kind of laborious process of creating a class yourself and creating the header and creating the CPP and adding all this boilerplate. The Unreal editor can actually create it for you. If you just go to outside of your content, your C++ classes, you can add a new class this way or you can do file. This is maybe changed a little bit since tools, new C++ class and you can create that here. If I went to create a new porn and do all that, it would give me a bunch of things. And if I went to create that, we'll just give this a second. Okay, we'll probably edit that out so it's a little bit shorter, but it did eventually generate the class for me. And the other thing to highlight is that when you do classes this way, it will actually automatically regenerate your project files and it'll perform this live coding compile, which is kind of recompiles all that code so it will be updated. But if I just quickly jump back to my project, you see it's asking me to reload and when I do that, it's going to when I give a Visual Studio a second. And it's finally caught up. You see we've got our new porn here and if I open that up, yeah, you can see it's got all this markup for us. You can see our porn is called MyPorn in the actual Solution Explorer, but once it's within code it's referred to as a MyPorn because porn inherits from actor. It's already got a generated header include, it's already got a U-class markup, it's already got generated body. So it's just worth highlighting that if you go through the editor, it will generate all this boilerplate for you as well as some kind of stub functions you might typically need like begin, play and tick, which I'm sure we'll get to in another session. But just to highlight that that's all kind of done for you if you go through the editor. Certain IDEs also do provide the functionality to do that within code so you don't have to have editor open to do that. But otherwise you can just do this from scratch and just add this boilerplate yourself, it just takes a little bit longer. If we just jump to the presentation, it's worth highlighting as well that these macros, it's not just about exposing them to the Unreal Reflection system, although that is definitely an important part of it. There's a whole suite of different things that we can mark up with these macros. We've got U-property, U-functions, U-classes, U-struct and U-enum. We'll kind of dig into each of these and what they actually mean. First and foremost, the most important thing is that U-property, you'll see a lot. It's worth highlighting that we've said that Unreal has garbage collection and it's managed memory. U-property is a key component of that, which I'll dig into it a little bit more in a bit. So to kind of go through these in an order, we'll start off with U-class. So anytime you have a class type that is a reflected type, so anything that is U-object or down will need this U-class markup above it. You can just have U-classes blank, but you can also add in some extra metadata to provide some extra kind of information to the engine about how it might be used in the editor side of things. So typical ones might be blueprint type, which would mean that in blueprint code, this class is accessible. It's a type that exists. It's a type that blueprint understands exists. Blueprintable would mean that you can make blueprints that inherit from this type and then abstract, same as C++ abstract, it just means that this class has nothing within it. It kind of exists as a template to have other classes inherit from it and then implement each of these functions. All of the U-class markup, it can be found in object macros and the same is true for all these reflected types, the U struct, U property, object.macros.h contains the full list of all these definitions. We'll just quickly jump to that to show you. U property. Yeah, so these are all the markup for U properties and the same thing can be found in here for classes, structs, etc. So U properties, again, U property goes above any member variables of either a U struct or a U class. It's probably worth iterating this multiple times, but you can't introduce properties with U property above them. You can't introduce kind of editor facing variables if it's not with inside a class or a struct that also is a U class or a U struct. So you can't have U properties inside a non U class class, if that makes sense. So you would typically add it above variables. The important thing to highlight about this is that whenever you have a pointer type, the U property markup is required to prevent what's contained within that variable getting marked for garbage collection. So if you have an active variable or an object variable or something like that and it doesn't have U property above it, there's a good chance it will get cleaned up by garbage collection. So the U property means that this pointer type is reference counted and that it won't get cleaned up by garbage collection until there are no objects with U property above it referencing it. So a typical U property meta markup would be edit anywhere, which essentially means that this value is exposed to the editor and can be tweaked either at play in editor time or it can be tweaked within the editor or within blueprints. Edit defaults only means that this variable is exposed but can only be edited in blueprints in the actual kind of archetype, not within instances within the level. Visible anywhere is pretty self-explanatory, just means that you can see this value but you can't edit it. Replicated means that this is intended for network replication, but it will actually, that this isn't enough on its own. You will need to do some additional coding to kind of mark up this thing to get passed around the network. Transient which just means that this property isn't serialized and it will get filled with the zero value at load time. It's worth highlighting as well that when we're talking about pointers, there has been a transition from Unreal 4 to Unreal 5. A lot of the codebase you'll still see will have pointer types that look a little bit like this. If I go inside that pawn I just quickly created and you would see inside the header if it had a reference to an actor it might look like this, a actor pointer, right? A standard kind of raw pointer and then it's still absolutely fine. But with Unreal 5 what they introduced was this new type T object pointer. It is the size equivalent of a 64-bit pointer but it provides kind of a whole set of extra functionality on top. So it's generally advised that whenever you're having a member property that is a pointer type instead of a, so if I had this type as my actor and again that should definitely have you property above it because otherwise it's going to get garbage collected. So you might see something like this. The kind of encourage new type is that we use U-T object pointer like this. It's not required but it is encouraged. It brings a whole suite of other functionality with it that I'll just go into now. So most importantly it supports lazy load behavior. What that essentially means is that it's going to speed up your editor build time. So this is more about improved quality of life in editor than it is really very much to do with runtime performance. So it improves its lazy load behavior which will speed up your load times in editor. It supports access tracking which is not only useful but important to bear in mind when you're doing things like a range-based loop. It's that because the actual T object pointer itself will now have data inside it you want to be looping through those as a kind of like on a reference basis right. So you want auto ref rather than making copies of your T object pointers. When passing it around to functions and when returning it from functions it can just be used as a it can just return a raw pointer. So it won't have a complete knock-on effect across your entire code base. You mainly need to be worrying about it in your actual member variable declarations. It supports the same prevention of garbage collection like a normal raw pointer. Again it will still require this U property markup above it. And the other thing is it supports cook time dependency tracking which means that there essentially increases the chance that the cooker keeps a good track of everything that relies on everything else. Yeah the places you can already see a lot of the engine has actually made use of this. So if we go to the um sorry using the wrong hotkeys here but if we went to the actor class so actor.h yeah you can see that a lot of the engine's own code has already shifted to using T object pointers rather than raw pointers. If you've already got some raw pointers it is actually worth highlighting that there's a useful tool that can kind of speed up that transition which is this unreal object pointer tool that lives in your project in your engine binaries. One second if I can just locate that. So if you locate your unreal engine and you go to your binaries folder win64 and you kind of filter for your applications you'll find it here it's called unreal object pointer tool. So there's a couple of steps to actually using this. If you look up the unreal 5 migration guide it kind of goes into a bit more detail about that but that can just help you make that transition from kind of raw pointers to T object pointer. So the next type we're going to talk about is the U function. So this is added to any functions that need to be callable in Blueprints. It's also important to highlight that anytime you have a delegate or a timer that you kind of or a I think maybe it's just delegates and timers you will need to add even just a blank U function markup above it if you want this to be used. So it's essentially anything that interfaces with the actual engine level and it supports a couple of different markup metadata's. The most typical one is Blueprint callable meaning this C++ function can get called by Blueprint. If that's not there Blueprint won't know that this function exists. Blueprint cosmetic which is essentially saying that this is only relevant to a client side. This is only kind of a client side function the server doesn't need to know about this because it's purely a kind of visual thing. Server and client and net multicast these are about the way that information is passed around a server. So is this a message that comes from the server and goes to a client? Is this a function that goes from the client to the server to notify it of something like input? And net multicast is a function that comes from the server and goes to all clients. There's a lot more information that goes into that but those are typical ones that you might see. It's also worth highlighting that this U function would be required to allow any of these functions to be called over a network. Lastly we have U struct and EatUenum. U struct is very much like U class but rather than for classes it's for structs and it is actually required for as I mentioned previously if you have any U properties within a struct that struct must be a U struct type and it must therefore have a generated body line within it. The typical U struct is a U struct that is a function that the typical metadata that you would see above a U struct is to say that a blueprint type which again just means that this is a struct type that is visible to blueprint. You can pass it around in blueprints. It's also worth a kind of slight discrepancy between U classes and U structs is that with a lot of data inside a U class Unreal will automatically zero fill all of that data particularly pointer types. The same is not true for U structs so it's good process anyway to use your initializer lists to fill all your variables with the correct default values but you need to be particularly sensitive of that with U structs. You should be null pointering by default your pointers otherwise you might end up with some garbage data in there and that's particularly sensitive with U structs. Then U enums again just above enum types. Worth pointing out that Unreal currently only supports Uint 8 enums and I believe they need to be enum class types. A lot of the time you would see I'm just trying to think of any enum type off of my head. Collision type I think is one collision shape type. If it's used by engine you'll see it's an enum class and inherits from Uint 8. If this were a class actually that needed to be exposed to blueprint that would need to be a U enum but a U enum would only work if it's an enum class and it inherits from Uint 8. We can't have 32 bit enums that's not supported by the engine at the moment.",
