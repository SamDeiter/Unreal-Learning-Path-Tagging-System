  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at editing and troubleshooting when it comes to working with ray tracing. So let's get started. So one of the things you can do if you want to test out your ray tracing console commands is you can create a level blueprint and in it you can create an event begin play. So when you hit play, those commands will be active. You can also make it linked to a key command, say as like the X key, you can turn them on and off, X to on, Y for off, and you can chain them together if you want or have them go in a sequential order. That's up to you if you want to do that. That's not really my preferred way to check it, but that option is there. If you're familiar with blueprints, it should be pretty easy to tackle that. And you can start with such things such as ray tracing, reflection captures, you can turn it on and off and test it out. But what we're going to do is I'm going to show you how to use a different method, which I think is much better. We're going to be using the console variable tool. This is a lot easier. You don't have to hit play. You can see what you're getting in editor. But you know, you can still have the option to use the level blueprint to be able to do it. So you are playing and seeing a reactive change. But let's go and do this in Unreal and we'll take a look at how it works. So here we are in Unreal. So what I can do here is I can grab one of these console variables. I already have one that I punched in earlier. Hit the up arrow. We'll get the reflection captures here. Get this one and this reflection capture. I'll just go and grab this. There we go. I'm going to copy that, bring it and click on the plus here for console variables. Put that console variable in there and just hit enter. Unreal will show me its default state. Now the nice thing about using this is you can check it on the fly and we can also test it after the fact. So I'm going to get close up to this door. Bring this in just a little bit. And you can put as many console variables as you need and you can do so and also save them if you want to. You can save that preset and load it later, which is really nice. And I like to do this because you can do this and see the reaction in editor. So I can now hit one and you'll see that it's using the reflection captures as a fallback. Works out pretty nice. And then I can hit zero and put it back so I can do a test. So I can do this with any one of my console variables. I prefer this method over the level blueprint, but you can use it any way that you want. But I find this pretty great. If for some reason again in your system you can't or see you can't see the console variable just go to your plugins and type in console variable and just turn it on and you should be good to go. And it's really great. Again, emphasize on the fact that you can save it and you can load that preset in there. That's pretty nice. One thing also to consider and it's something I mentioned briefly in the past is when you're using ray tracing global illumination, you do have to be careful when it comes to small items in your scene. Now, case in point, if you built a model and you have a lot of little pieces of geometry in there and what can happen is it can slow things down. There's a tendency where those those photons are going to be hitting those little objects and going back and giving that information to the camera. So you got to be very deterministic. It's better to weld when you can or use normals when you can, but also be very also deterministic when you're using your normals. If you use it a high resolution textures and you have to test things out as you go. A big heavy factor, though, is going to be that roughness again. So double check your roughness in your material to be able to test out and see where the noise lies, where it's at and then work it out accordingly. Now, you can also turn on ray tracing global illumination instead of using or actually, I should say off instead of using it. You can use screen space, global illumination, and I'm going to show you that in just a bit. And actually can work out pretty good. It's not too bad, but it can maybe make it so things run a little bit smoother. You can also use lumen, which we talked about, but your mesh distance fields need to be generated in your project settings. So you make sure you turn that on there. So here are a few more ray tracing tips and tricks here where you can use ray tracing global illumination screen percentage. This can help performance by using this command. Trace is significantly less. You want to set it to 25 or 50. That can be helpful. Another one is enabling material sorting may improve the cost of shading and reflected surfaces and you can use this CVAR called sort materials and it works really great. You can use the also use the hybrid ray trace looking at reflections, making it easier on bounces after a particular distance. This one works really great. You can also plug this one in too. Ray tracing reflections are expensive and can be managed using reflection actors as a last bounce, which you saw us do just a minute ago. So this is the one that we just plugged in and that one is the reflection captures and that one works really great. And again, it can help with quality control when it comes to ray tracing. Let's jump into Unreal for a minute. I'm going to point out some things I mentioned earlier, just some factors that you do need to keep in mind. So we talked about Unreal, how there is a difference between your interiors when it comes to ray tracing versus your exteriors. You'll notice that we're at a pretty solid 63 frames per second kind of shuffles between 63, 64. And it's not too bad, but you'll notice it will get at least 20 to 25 frames more outside. Now we're at 90. It's actually about 30. So you can see the photons bouncing around are a lot more expensive when you're in the interior because they're in an enclosed area and those photons are bouncing back to the camera versus the exterior. So when you build your ray tracing scene, keep those things in mind when you're working with ray tracing. Here's some additional ray tracing commands you can take a look at for skylight contribution, ray tracing, global illumination, evaluate skylight. You can also see enable materials. This tests the effects of your materials and you can use the console command for that. You can also turn all your ray tracing effects off if you want to see what it looks like with or without. And that helps if you're kind of doing a hybrid where you're mixing lumen and you're mixing ray tracing, you can actually see, hey, do I like this effect? You can play with a few things if you want to when you do so. Again some things to keep in mind. So loss, reduce the bounces. Reducing bounces can make a scene smoother frame wise, but not necessarily with visuals. And again, translucent materials, as I always say, are expensive. In general, so keep that in mind. So you got to think about your milliseconds, how it's being hit. You can see maximum bounces for translucent surface. You can see set to one, you get 24.2 milliseconds. Set to two, 32 milliseconds. Set to three, 42.1 in delay milliseconds there. And GPU costs on translucency. So if you do timeout, we have a link here in the slides here. And this timeout will, this link here will show you how to correct that. So you'll have to go into your systems in your windows and you mess with your TDR delay and do some editing there. And again, emphasize here on setting up your resolution. If you are going to use that resolution captures as a fallback, set it to 1024 to 2048. Both of those work pretty well. You'll probably see minimal changes between them, but you definitely want to least have it at a 1024 leech. Each light again needs to be movable. They do have a raytraced samples per pixel inside of the light, which I mentioned earlier. You may see minimal changes with that, but that option is there to give you a little bit better with your shadow quality if you want to. But for the most part, by default, it works pretty well. You can see final gather recommended. We have a four and a 16, four for bounces, 16 for samples per pixel. And again, you can also see for best quality results, use brute force. And we talked about start low and then go high. So just make sure you keep those things in mind. So final gather emphasize again here, powers of two, eight, 16, 32 and 64. Now that even though that is lighter than brute force, you can get some pretty good options in there. It's just you still have to consider things and how they're laid out. You don't necessarily want to you don't want to throw the whole kitchen sink on this. You want to start low and then go high and then work with powers of two. But remember, those noise that noise will be very a lot more persistent when it comes to final gather. So brute force will take some of that away. So keep that in mind. You'll see at the bottom here, it says to aid in suppressing temporal ghosting artifacts. You can use the following command to modify the world space rejection criteria. So you can actually punch that in here. Ray tracing dot global illumination, final gather, and you'll see number of units and you can choose that and play with that number and see what you get. What's that? Did you say you wanted to have some cheap global illumination with your ray tracing reflections? Well, you can and you can replace that, which I mentioned earlier with screen space GI. We can do that all within our post process volume. So if I click on my post process volumes and scroll down, you'll see global illumination method. It'll ask me, do I want to do lumen? You'll notice we'll get an error because we don't have the mesh distance fields ready to go. And that's fine. We can set that to screen space and screen space works just great with ray tracing. It's not too shabby. Now, is it perfect? No, it's cheap. And as you move your camera around, so you have a glowing object, you'll see that deprecate kind of what we were talking about in other classes when it comes to using god rays. You'll actually turn and you'll see it disappear. If I had a glowing material floating around somewhere, you would actually see that happen. Oh, look, we have a glowing material. So let's go and bring a simple piece of geometry. How did that get there? I didn't know. So we'll put this piece of geometry here. We'll put that glowing material on there. And we can change this glowing material. Now you'll notice it gives off light. This is actually kind of nice. Kind of imitates a bit what you get from lumen. See, look, there's light coming off there. But if I turn my camera, you'll see it actually clip. Now we may get lucky and it doesn't quite do it as much, but you'll see right at the corner. Watch. Keep your eye right here. You'll see that change. So keep that in mind. If you decide to use screen space, there are some limitations with that, but it can be on the cheap. It can make increased frames a bit more and make it so you're not using ray tracing or lumen. You're using a bit of screen space with ray tracing reflections. So that is very much possible to be able to do that. So with Unreal 5.3, lights with ray traced shadows can now optionally shadow volumetric fog. You can enable this with the console variable, our volumetric fog dot inject ray traced lights, which is off by default due to performance costs. So again, be careful with this as it's expensive. Fog is always expensive. And I say that quite often. So just keep that in mind. Here's a link here that we have for ray tracing tips and tricks. So feel free to click on that one. So now on the next one, we're going to look at path tracer and look at the cool things we can produce. Thanks again.",
