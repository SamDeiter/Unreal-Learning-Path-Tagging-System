  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at Lumen visualizers, and we're also going to look at some tips and tricks to get you going in the right direction when it comes to Lumen. So let's get started. The Lumen visualizers allow us to actually see what's being done and being calculated under the hood. You also have under show the ability to turn off things that are being calculated one by not as a whole, as you would with the Lumen visualizers. The Lumen visualizers give you an overview of your old scene, your reflection in your surface catch. But under show under Lumen, we can actually pick walk through all the things being calculated on a more distinct level and turn them off. Let's go and take a look at this briefly in Unreal and to see how to access these. To do so, we're going to go underneath lit first off and go to Lumen and look at the Lumen overview. Again, these are the Lumen visualize mode. I'll click on overview. This is going to show me my geometry normals, my hardware ray tracing, hit lighting, and my Lumen scene. And it's showing pink missing surface catch coverage, yellow called surface catch. Basically, it's giving me kind of my overall scene look and what's being called and what's being calculated to my liking. Now, if you see, if you move away, you'll see some yellow and some even pink in the distance based on our angle and positioning. As we get closer, you'll see some of those go away. Now, some of these pieces, when they're all one piece welded, you will see some of those pink areas for Unreal's trying to calculate them as best they can. What you really want to avoid more than anything else are black areas. And that brings us to our next topic. To be able to see those black areas, we can use a Unreal visualize card placement, number one in our CVARS. Now, what this does overall, what is happening is Lumen generates an automatic. Now, it's a big word here, paramaterialization of the nearby scene surface called a surface catch. Used to quickly look up lighting at ray hit points in the scene, Lumen captures the material properties for each mesh from multiple angles called cards and are generated offline for each mesh. So these cards can be seen and visualized ahead of time. Now, if you get black areas on your mesh as you do this visualization, that is telling you that those black areas aren't being calculated correctly and there's an issue. You'll see two different pieces here. There's one which is a little bit more open and may even be welded in this particular case. But in this one, it's all one contained unit to be able to walk through and have people interact with. Unfortunately, Lumen doesn't really like that so much because it's having a hard time calculating where surfaces begin and end. So it's better to be able to build your stuff of best practice on an individual basis where you have a wall, make it very modulated, build it like as if you were building a Lego set or you can think of it as in the real world how a house is actually built. Now a lot of times that's a little bit better and even in production workflows, that's better because then you can customize each piece. If you're using Houdini, you can use or even our geometry nodes or I should say procedural generated nodes. You can actually use those in either case, whether it's Houdini geometry nodes or in Unreal and you can build things on a practical basis where it's individual pieces and change them on the fly. So that's really a better method when it comes to looking at things in Unreal. Let's go into Unreal and actually apply this visualization card placement and take a look at how things are being calculated on this dynamic level. In Unreal, I'm going to go to my output lock. I'm going to cheat a little bit. I already have the visual card placement, CVAR already active and ready to go. I'm going to hit my, let me get rid of this one here. I'm going to hit my up arrow and we'll see we have a lumen visualized card placement at one. Before we do that, though, let me make sure I put everything back to regular lit mode just for safe precautionary measures there. And I'm going to go ahead and switch that card placement to a one and hit enter. Now Unreal is going to show me how it is calculating these objects and their surface information all at one time. It seems to be doing a pretty good job. This is built very modularly. You'll see that there's pieces connected and pushed into each other as if it was built in the real world. And I'm going to go ahead and turn that off. I'm going to hit my up arrow, set that to zero and hit enter. And now we can see that it is turned off. So the surface catch can be used to see areas that don't have surface catch coverage. They're colored pink in the surface catch view mode of the level editor. And you'll see these areas are in pink. You'll notice, though, these areas will not bounce light and will appear black in reflections. So you've got to be careful with that. So to be able to find those black areas to make sure they do not become a problem, you can use your visualizer to maybe spot them. But also, if you need to, you can also increase the amount of mesh cards per task. Now, again, the best practice, as you see a note down here, is to separate your pieces as much as possible and even modulate them, because obviously that'll make it a little bit less on the draw calls. Does that mean you can't merge? No, you can merge pieces, but be aware of the issues that may occur. So just be very smart and deterministic when you do so. Only merge as needed. But at the same time, there's also the ability to merge nanite objects, which we can into other classes using the merge tool. Let's take a look here at some tips and tricks. So Lumen reflections support more than one bounce when hardware ray tracing is enabled with hit lighting. So remember, it actually can help out a lot if your card is able to do it. And the Max reflection bounces setting in the post process volume is set to two or greater. So keep those things in mind when you're actually using this particular feature. This can prevent black areas and reflections when there is enough performance budget to allow it. So, again, having a good card to be able to support this is going to be really key. Lumen reflections can be used without Lumen GI, so you can't turn those on if you needed for games and applications which use static lighting. So just be very deterministic. I always say remember where you park. That means remember your settings. So if you do mix and match your GI and your reflections, say maybe you're using raytraced reflections, you're using Lumen GI, you're using some other GI and you're using Lumen reflections, just remember where those settings lie and what you have set in so that you can troubleshoot things ahead of time. So just be careful with that. So Lumen hardware ray tracing optimizations, you'll see including enabling async compute for hardware ray tracing by default on console. So this is in there for you to actually check things and to make sure things are working correctly when it comes to producing things for console. Lumen overview visualization mode, you'll see in 5.3, it includes the view of geometry, which we saw normals of the Lumen scene, making it easier to spot issues with global distance fields in the case of software ray tracing or nanite fallback meshes in the case of hardware ray tracing. So we've added that and it's very helpful for you. You'll also see a CVAR here, it says Lumen reflections and visualize traces, and is now added for visualizing and debugging reflection rays. So you can also use that CVAR too. In 5.3, material AO updated, we've now updated it so that previously it was applied on top of the emissive and indirect lighting, but now you'll actually get a better result and you have to make sure your static is lighting is turned off, which we talked about previously, because Lumen, as you see at the very bottom, does not support static lighting. Quick review for softening up those shadows, we have source angle on a directional light will soften your shadows. Your source radius on a local light will soften your shadows. So reminder about ray tracing mode, this is going to be very beneficial for you, but you can choose this, whatever your card can support. If you're going to use a detailed tracing or global tracing, just be very deterministic when using it. So that's about it with this one. Here is some links to help you further your knowledge on these topics. And in the next video, we're going to take a look at Nanite and virtual shadow maps and how they work. Thanks again.",
