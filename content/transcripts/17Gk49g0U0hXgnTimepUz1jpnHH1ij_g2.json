  "text": " In this video, we'll examine how various DCC applications handle scene hierarchies and how best to preserve them in Unreal Engine. As we've already seen, Datasmith creates a hierarchy of parent and child relationships in Unreal Engine to mirror a similar setup that started in the DCC tool. Whenever possible, consider adopting various naming conventions and using tools in your DCC application to automate hierarchies and keep things organized. Consider using layers, groups, blocks, adjusting your pivot points, or using dummy or null objects which are quite similar to empty actors in Unreal Engine. Let's start with 3ds Max. Consider using the Layers tool which works exactly the same way in Unreal Engine as it does in 3ds Max. All objects in each layer will be preserved when it comes over into Unreal. If you'd like to preserve the parent-child actor relationship in the Outliner, if you'd like to preserve a parent-child actor relationship in the Unreal Engine Outliner, use the Group tool in 3ds Max to provide an empty actor for the child meshes to be attached to. Ensure the pivot points are in the correct place and liberally use the Rename tool to ensure you know what each object is. Be careful exporting any objects in 3ds Max that have been scaled or mirrored. If you have, use the Reset XForm tool in the Utilities menu prior to exporting. Also note instances are preserved from 3ds Max and will result in a single static mesh over in Unreal Engine 5. Here in SketchUp Pro, we can already see an example of when it can be important to rename your actors to ensure that you know what they are. If we didn't know what these are over in SketchUp, we're certainly not going to know what they are when they translate over to Unreal Engine. The way the hierarchies work is a group is used as a top parent under the Datasmith scene, then come the components, then come the various objects that are part of the component. If an object is separate and not part of a component or a group, it will lie directly under the Datasmith scene in the hierarchy. Be sure to name your objects, components, and groups according to a naming convention that works for you. Otherwise, as we can see, things get very messy very quickly. Like 3ds Max, components that have the same definition will become instanced in Unreal Engine 5 and only have a single static mesh definition per object. And again like 3ds Max, layers will be preserved, which is primarily helpful for selecting groups of actors at once and toggling on and off different categories of objects. In Revit, the hierarchy works like this. A level is used as a top parent under the Datasmith scene, then come the family types, then come the components inside of that family. The layer list that Unreal Engine will give you after a Revit file will be based on family types. Note that because of the nature of Revit, you'll be somewhat more limited in terms of how you can rename or rearrange different assets. Note that families also count as instanced geometry and will create one mesh in Unreal Engine that gets used by all family objects in the scene. Note that a family will create a single static mesh in Unreal Engine, which then becomes instanced throughout the scene, just like 3ds Max and SketchUp Pro. For Rhino, our layers become the top parent in UE5, then the defined blocks, then the various components of that block. Note that Rhino groups do not affect the hierarchy in UE5, unlike 3ds Max. In Rhino, we recommend using blocks as much as possible, as they'll also help with establishing pivot points. Otherwise, the pivot point of every object will be set to 0,0,0, resulting in objects that are very far away from their origin. Again, be sure to rename layers and individual objects in Rhino so when they come to Unreal Engine they still make sense. And note there's a robust scripting community for Rhino, and there are scripts out there that will rename objects based on layers, groups, or anything else you might like. Here are two Python scripts as examples. Note that instanced blocks in Rhino result in a single static mesh definition for the components of that block, again carrying on this trend that one piece of geometry can then be instanced many times when it makes its way back over to Unreal. In the next video, in the next video, we'll explore the modeling tools available to us in Unreal Engine.",
