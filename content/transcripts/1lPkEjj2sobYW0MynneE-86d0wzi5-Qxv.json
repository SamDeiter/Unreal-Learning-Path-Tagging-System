  "text": " We're going to take a look at the Blend Poses by nodes because sometimes you need to briefly transition from one animation to another, but unlike traditional animation, we don't know the exact time the transition needs to take place. So instead, these nodes listen to certain variables that store information and whenever those values change, the Blend node will smoothly switch from one input animation to another. And this is really useful if your character picks up a prop and needs to use an entirely different animation or animations. So if I hop into Unreal, so the first thing we're going to do is just disconnect the Blend multi node, alt click, bring down the output pose. And the next node we're going to look at, if I right click in an empty space and I type in Blend Pose, the first node is Blend Pose by Boole, which is short for Boolean, and we'll click on that one. Now Boolean is just a variable that stores true or false information. And if you ever forget that, if you look at the node, you'll notice there's a true pose and a false pose. And I'll go ahead and connect these two nodes together. And let's go ahead and use a variable that already exists that does have true false information. So there's this variable over here. It's called isInAir. And what I'm going to do is left click drag the isInAir variable onto the active value. And I want to make sure I get that nice green checkmark and then release. So now this node is listening to those values. And if you're wondering how those values get determined, we can go to the event graph. And here is where the isInAir variable is getting set. This character, it happens to already have an isFalling function. And it will return true if the character is not flying or not in water or not on the ground. And it's calculating that for us. We don't have to worry about it. And then if we go back to the animation graph, we can determine which animation we use when the character is in the air or when it's on the ground. Now this example I'm about to show you, it's a little goofy because normally you use state machines to transition. And it handles things like that already. You know, if you jump, it already changes the animation to the jump loop, for instance. So this is going to be a bit of an oversimplification, but I think it will get the point across. So how about if the character is in the air, we will use the jump loop animation. And I'm going to drag that on the true pose. And then if the character is not, we will use the idle animation. So I will drag that on the false pose. And let's go ahead and compile. And save and go over to third person example map. And let's just see what we did. I'll hit play. And if I, you know, move around, I'm just stuck in this idle position. I mean, this would be great if the character were on a hoverboard or something, right? Now, if I hit the space bar, the animation transitions between the idle and the falling animation. And then I will escape. And let's go back to the animation graph because I want to exaggerate these blend time values. Now, the true blend time value, that's how long it takes to transition to the true pose. And then likewise, the false blend time is how long it will take to get to the false animation pose. So let's really crank the first one up. So let's say it takes two seconds for the false animation to transition to the true animation. And then let me make the animation blend time for the false pose. So let's make it really jarring just so we can appreciate the fact that there is a blend time. So the transition to the true animation, it's going to be way too long. And the animation transition to the false pose, that's going to be really snappy and it's not going to look good. So let's compile and see what we did. So if I go back to third person example map and hit play, and then I'm roaming around. And if I hit the space bar, it takes a really long time for him to switch to that floating animation. But then, I mean, look, he also snaps really, really abruptly to his idle position. So I will hit escape and go back to third person in them. And now you can appreciate, OK, I can adjust these values. Maybe I want a little bit more than the default time. So I set it to point two and let's compile third person example map, hit play. And I mean, I'm OK with that. You could change it to the original point one that seems to work as well, too. But I just I wanted to show you that the true and the false transition time can be manipulated independently. So let's go back to our animation blueprint. And I'm just going to move a little bit further down in our animation graph because you don't just have to use true false value information. There's also if I right click and I type in the blend pose by int short for integer, that's the next one we'll look at. And then let's go ahead and disconnect blend pose by bool alt click, move down the output pose, connect those up. And an integer is just a nice number that doesn't have any decimal point values or fractional numbers. They're nice, clean numbers. So we could create a variable that. Is an integer, so if I go to variable and I do the plus symbol right here. And then I could call it which enum, for instance, and then if I go over to the details panel, I could change the variable type to integer. And then make sure you compile, because you have to compile before you can set the default value of your variable. Little tip right there and then. We could drag the which enum variable onto the active child index. So now this node is listening to the integer variable and it will use that to drive which animation is currently being used now with Boolean's. It was just true false and you knew that it was just going to be two different animations. But with integers, you could have any number of numbers. And if you right click on. The blend pose by int node, there is the add blend pin. And you can add however many animation inputs you need for your variable. So maybe. In the event graph, maybe I were to. Set up some blueprint functionality that modifies the variable, so maybe. As the character picks up more objects and puts it in its backpack. The value gets larger. And as the value gets larger, maybe we switch between different animations that make the character look more and more hunched over. And that's another thing that we could do and control dynamically. Now, one more thing I want to talk about is this blend pose by enumerator node. And enumerators, they are user specified variables instead of numbers or true false values. For example, you could have a damage state variable and instead of 123 as value options, you could decide to use small, medium, heavy, etc. And then the damage state could change how distressed the animations look. So these nodes are great for interactive experiences. And in the next video, we will switch back to developing our Frankenstein animation with the layered blend per bone node.",
