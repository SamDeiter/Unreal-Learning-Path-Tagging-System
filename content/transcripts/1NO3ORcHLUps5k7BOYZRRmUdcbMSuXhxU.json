  "text": " To start a new project, you typically use the Epic Games launcher. This is your hub to anything related to Unreal Engine. This includes Unreal Engine news, learning resources, Marketplace, and the versions of the engines installed along with a handy link to the projects you have already saved. To create a new project, you first start the engine, usually the most current version available to you. When Unreal starts, it'll ask you whether you want to open an existing project or create a new one. When you elect to create a new project, you base it on a startup template. The templates give you a set of enabled functionality. They are categorized by industry to assist you in making the right choice. You can choose the template that works best for you and the project you are working on. If you choose a template at this stage and then realize it is missing certain functionality that you need, you can still enable that functionality at a later time, so there is nothing destructive about your current choice. In this case, since this class is targeting AEC users, we'll choose that category and a simple blank template. You are then asked for additional options, which we will not use in this project. Still, note the starter pack option, which is disabled at this stage. The starter pack gives you access to assets and other sample files, so that you have something to work with. You can enable it here and now, or enable it at a later time if you so choose. Again, to reiterate then, you are not bound by the choices you make at this stage. Finally, you want to give your project a name and a path. The defaults will work for now. You may wish to shorten the path itself, because projects in Unreal Engine can be made of collections of files, folders and subfolders, so anything you can do to minimize the path length is often useful. Once this is done, Unreal exits and fires up again with the new project displayed. The screen shows the default interface at this stage. You're looking at what is called the main level. A level is a repository of objects placed in a scene. Right now, there are already a few components in place. You can create as many levels as you want, each with its own set of objects, or actors as they are referred to. To create a new level, choose File, New Level. With the AEC template we started off, you get a choice of using a completely blank level, or one that already contains a few actors. Choose the Time of Day level. Unreal will need a few moments to compensate for the light intensity between this level and the last one we used. Ultimately, you'll see that this new level contains a few actors in place, a floor, a shader ball and a couple of lines of text, as well as some additional actors that give you a startup lighting scenario. You can certainly see these actors in the viewport, but you can also see them listed in the World Outliner. You can also use the Outliner to select objects when they are too difficult to select in the viewport, such as when they are hidden behind other objects. You can also use the Outliner to organise your scene a bit better. For example, you can group many actors together inside one folder for easier access. Select all of the actors except the shader ball, the floor and the text. You can add or remove actors using the Ctrl key. Right-click on a selected actor in the Outliner and choose Move to, Create New Folder. Name the folder, exclamation mark Essentials. The exclamation mark prefix guarantees that this folder will remain at the top of the Outliner panel. Now click the shader ball to select it and press Delete to remove it from the level. Do the same with the floor and the two lines of text. This will make the scene empty except for the essential components. Let's import the Epic House scene. It was originally modelled in Revit and then brought into 3D Max for additional adjustment, and then exported to Datasmith. On the main toolbar, click the Datasmith button and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file you downloaded for this class. Under the assets slash ds, select and open the epichouse.udatasmith file. You are then asked where you want to store the data inside your Unreal project. At this time, your project is mostly empty, so you can create a folder to store that information or you can let Unreal create one for you using the project file name. Click OK for now. Next, you are asked what type of data you want to import. Typically, you certainly want to import the geometry and the materials you applied in your DCC or CAD application. Optionally, if you also have created lights, cameras or animations, you can import those too. However, this particular file doesn't have any cameras or animations saved, so you can leave these unchecked. Click the import button. After a few seconds, the file is imported and Shader's compiled to show the architectural project reconstructed in Unreal. There is a new hierarchy in the world outliner showing you the hierarchical structure of the building. Also note at the bottom of the screen in the panel named Content Browser, a new folder named after the datasmith file was automatically created and is now part of your Unreal project. There is a little icon next to the filters in the Content Browser that is labelled Show or Hide the Sources Panel. I suggest you keep the Show option activated as it lets you navigate the folder hierarchy a little bit easier, like you do in File Explorer. Navigation in the viewport is pretty straightforward. A right click and drag lets you look around from a fixed point. Right click and WSAD keys lets you move forward, backwards, left and right. Right click plus Q and E lets you change the height of your point of view. If the navigation motion is too fast or too slow, you can adjust it with a slider in the top right corner of the viewport. If an object is selected and you press F, that would frame the object in the viewport. And finally, Alt, left click and drag lets you orbit or tumble around the scene. There are other hotkeys for viewport navigation, but those few we talked about should be enough for most of your needs. This is a good time to save your work. You've created a new level and you've imported models, materials and textures into it. Note the tab in the top left hand corner. It says Untitled and is followed by a little asterisk. Similarly, if you look in the folders that were created at import time in the Content Browser, you will notice a series of thumbnails representing various assets, all of which also have an asterisk on them. Asterisks are an indication that the data has not yet been saved. On the Content Browser panel, click the Save All button. Since we have multiple assets to save, we might as well do them all in one sweep. A dialog appears showing all the data that is yet to be saved. Click the Save Selected button. You are prompted to give your level a new name. You can save it anywhere, but typically you create a separate folder to store your save levels. This can be done with a right click and you can name your folder Levels or Maps, as is often used in the game industry. Once that's done, you can give your level a new name and save it to that folder. Now if you were to double check, you will notice all the asterisks are gone.",
