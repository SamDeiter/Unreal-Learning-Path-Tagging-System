00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this section, we will review the Mesh to MetaHuman workflow using the Template Mesh option.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This workflow allows for a metahuman identity to be solved based on the geometry input,

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which results in a more precise match and better joint positioning for LODs.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's take a look at the requirements and steps of this workflow.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The Mesh to MetaHuman workflow using the Template Mesh option,

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which can also be referred to as the Conformed Mesh option,

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
allows users to conform a metahuman identity by directly assigning a specific template mesh.

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This forces a precise fit of the metahuman topology.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In order for this to work, the main requirement is that the input mesh

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
must already be conformed to the topology of the metahuman template mesh.

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In the previous sections, we went over different approaches for fitting metahuman topology to a scanner sculpt.

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This workflow allows us to use the fitted metahuman head geometry asset as an input

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and results in getting the geometry and joint positions closer to the target delta across all LODs.

14
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now let's move on to the next section where we will work through a hands-on exercise

15
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to create a metahuman identity with the Mesh to MetaHuman workflow using the template mesh option.
