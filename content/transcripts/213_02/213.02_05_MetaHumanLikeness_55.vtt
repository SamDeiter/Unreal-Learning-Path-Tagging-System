00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
In this section, we will touch upon different approaches for achieving likeness using the

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.200
MetaHuman Framework tools.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.719
We will also address expectations regarding how far customizations to the neutral pose

4
00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.679
can be pushed before encountering issues.

5
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.719
We can approach achieving likeness with MetaHuman characters using the various MetaHuman Framework

6
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:28.719
tools.

7
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.240
A good place to start is with the MetaHuman Creator.

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.859
Something to keep in mind is that the MetaHuman presets come from a database of real-world

9
00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.719
scanned people.

10
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.019
This means the more faces that are added to the database, the larger the options will

11
00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.719
be to achieve specific facial features.

12
00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.079
Another option is to use the mesh to MetaHuman workflow.

13
00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.320
The MetaHuman plugin allows users to create a MetaHuman identity from a mesh, from footage,

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200
or from a template mesh.

15
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.359
The MetaHuman identity can be solved based on image or geometry.

16
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:14.400
With the DNA calibration tools, MetaHuman customizations can be pushed even further.

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.519
This workflow requires some knowledge in rigging, modeling, and Python.

18
00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:25.039
Let's move on and address expectations for achieving likeness with our characters.

19
00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.959
It is important to keep in mind the golden triangle of the face when making changes to

20
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.079
the neutral pose.

21
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.920
The triangle is related to the database that the MetaHuman presets come from.

22
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.479
Stylized faces with exaggerated facial features introduce large deltas outside of the database

23
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.039
range.

24
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.640
And this can result in issues with range of motion when animation is applied.

25
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.200
Here are a few considerations when working with stylized MetaHuman faces.

26
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.960
For cinematics, if using only LOD0, certain facial features can be pushed further, such

27
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.879
as a stronger jawline, bigger ears, a larger forehead, or a larger upper nose and cheekbones.

28
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.120
It is possible to see breaks in the golden triangle area of the face.

29
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.280
However, you can get away with a lot more when using only LOD0.

30
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.159
For games where LODs in optimization are crucial, it is likely to see issues with range of motion

31
00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.960
with exaggerated facial features such as a big or tiny nose, lips, or eyes.

32
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.719
In addition, customizations to LOD0 will not be passed down to the lower LODs, as those

33
00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.719
are joints only and require joint matching.

34
00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:48.479
In cases like these, the mesh to MetaHuman workflow using the template mesh option may

35
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:52.719
help to transfer the larger shapes to the lower LODs.

36
00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.120
However, there will still be more work to do.

37
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120
And that is where DNA calibration comes in.

38
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.719
Now something to note about using a globally applied blend shape for customizations.

39
00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.599
At first, it might appear that this can help achieve more likeness with the neutral pose.

40
00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.599
But since the vertex and joint positions of the rig are not updated in the DNA file,

41
00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.319
the face may not behave correctly when animations are applied, and that shape will not be present

42
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.919
for lower LODs.

43
00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.079
Now that we have addressed expectations and considerations when working with stylized MetaHuman

44
00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.120
faces, let's move on to the next portion of our course, where we explore a variety of

45
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.759
customization workflows that can be used to modify the MetaHuman neutral pose.
