00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this portion of our course, we will go through a few simple use case scenarios using the DNA calibration library in Maya.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Using the scripts from the examples folder, we will use the DNA viewer runinMaya script to view metahumanDNA.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We will use the Propagate changes from Scene to DNA script to EditDNA files for exporting the head LODs as FBX.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So let's get started with DNA viewer.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The DNA viewer runinMaya script allows us to look at a DNA file and do things such as choose what LODs we want to assemble and what properties we want in them.

6
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now let's switch over to Maya and go through the steps for using this script to read a DNA file and assemble a functional rig.

7
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Inside of a new Maya scene, I have opened up the script editor and docked it over here.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Over here, in File Explorer, I have the DNA calibration examples folder open.

9
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I will select the DNA viewer runinMaya script and then right click on it and select Open with Notepad.

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I will copy all of this and in the script editor, I will use the plus sign over here to add a new Python window.

11
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then I will paste the script here.

12
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Next, I will select all of this, right click and select Execute.

13
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The DNA viewer window will pop up.

14
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now the first thing we will do is go over here to assign the path of the DNA file we want to look at.

15
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I will click here and search for the file.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The DNA files will be located in the DNA calibration data folder in the folder named DNA files.

17
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I am going to select the DNA file named Lena that I have added from the Unreal Fest Zip and now I can select Load DNA.

18
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Next, we can select what LODs we want to assemble and what properties we want in them.

19
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
For example, if we only want to assemble LOD 0 and the head mesh only, we can select only those two things.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
To assemble a fully functional rig, we will want to select all of the LODs and all of their contents.

21
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We can do this by choosing Select All Meshes.

22
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now for the build options, I will check on Joints, Blend Shapes and Skin Clusters.

23
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Notice that the rig logic will be grayed out.

24
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let's go here and assign the GUI path.

25
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This is located in the data folder and since we are using the latest version of MetaHuman,

26
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I will open up the MH4 folder and select the GUI that's in here.

27
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This will load the faceboard and selectable controls.

28
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Next, we will assign the Analog GUI path.

29
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This is located in the data folder right here.

30
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This loads the GUI for the controls affecting the I direction.

31
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Next, we will assign the Additional Assembly Script.

32
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
This is located in the data folder and again since we want to use the latest version of MetaHuman,

33
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I will open up the MH4 folder and select this one.

34
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now that we have assigned these, the RigLogic option can now be checked on

35
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and this will connect all of the functions of the rig giving it behavior.

36
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We can now select Process.

37
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We will get a warning from Maya asking us if we want to save the existing scene.

38
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I will select Discard.

39
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
This will begin to assemble the full rig and everything in the DNA file

40
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and this may take a moment.

41
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Now that it is loaded, I can minimize this

42
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and over here we can see the Lena DNA file.

43
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Since we enabled RigLogic,

44
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
we can select a control

45
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and we'll see that when we move it, the face is fully functional.

46
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And this is how you can use the DNA viewer run in Maya script.

47
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now let's do a quick review before we move on.

48
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We just went through the steps of using the DNA viewer run in Maya script.

49
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
This script allows us to visualize a DNA file,

50
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
choose what LODs we want to assemble and what properties we want in them.

51
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
To read and create a functional rig in Maya,

52
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
start by pasting the entire script in the script editor

53
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and then run the entire command.

54
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Once DNA viewer pops up, assign the path of the DNA file you wish to view.

55
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This will commonly be located in the data DNA files folder.

56
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Then select low DNA.

57
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Next, select the LODs and the contents you want to assemble.

58
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
If you want all the LODs, then select all meshes.

59
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Next, choose the build options.

60
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
To assemble a fully functioning rig,

61
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
check on joints, blend shapes and skin clusters.

62
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
To enable rig logic, you will need to assign the GUI path,

63
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
which is located in the data folder.

64
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This will load the faceboard GUI and as mentioned,

65
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
you will want to use the updated rig,

66
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so select the GUI file located in the data MH4 folder.

67
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Assign the analog GUI path,

68
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
which is the GUI for the controls affecting the eye direction.

69
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And then assign the additional assembly script path,

70
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
which is used for final tweaks or metadata.

71
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And this is located in the data MH4 folder for the updated rigs.

72
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Once all of these paths have been assigned,

73
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
rig logic and the build options can be enabled.

74
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This will connect all of the functions of the rig.

75
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Finally, you can select process,

76
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and this will assemble the full rig and everything in it.

77
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Now, let's move on to the next section,

78
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
where we will use the propagate changes to DNA script,

79
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and make some minor modeling changes to the rig,

80
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and edit the DNA file.
