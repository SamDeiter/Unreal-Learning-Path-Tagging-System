00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.299
In this section of our course, we will go through a hands-on exercise where we will

2
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:14.160
export the conformed mesh that is generated from a metahuman identity solve from the metahuman

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.519
identity asset window.

4
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.760
This exercise demonstrates one approach to fitting metahuman topology to a scanner sculpt

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.940
by using the conformed mesh to refit any details that were lost from the solve.

6
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.859
If you already fitted the metahuman head topology to your scanner sculpt using a metahuman preset,

7
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.899
you would skip these steps.

8
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.039
We will primarily work in Unreal Engine.

9
00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.420
As we work through this exercise, you will note that this is broken down into a step-by-step

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.939
process that is found in your slide deck.

11
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:54.340
As we complete portions of the practical exercise, I will review the completed steps.

12
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.340
Now, let's jump into Unreal Engine and go through the steps of exporting the conformed

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.659
mesh from the metahuman identity asset window.

14
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.300
Inside of Unreal Engine, to get started, we would first need to go through the steps of

15
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.460
generating a metahuman identity that will be used for fitting metahuman topology to a

16
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.780
scan using the standard mesh to metahuman workflow.

17
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.340
Since we already went through those steps and generated one in the metahuman introduction

18
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.120
class, let's locate that metahuman identity asset.

19
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.659
Under the courses folder, in the folder named MEH11301, let's navigate to the course topics

20
00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.340
folder.

21
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.060
In the folder named mesh to metahuman identity, it is located in the folder named EX for example.

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.299
The metahuman identity is named RCSCAN.

23
00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.859
Let's double-click on this to open it.

24
00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.560
Inside of here, the first step is to go down here to the command PROPT.

25
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:09.140
Then enter the command MHIDENITY EXPORT MESHES and the number 1 and press ENTER.

26
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.039
Now go up to the main toolbar and select metahuman identity solve.

27
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:21.919
What this does is it exports the metahuman identity conformed mesh.

28
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.919
Once this process completes, we can close this window.

29
00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:33.459
The next step is to locate the exported conformed mesh which will be in the file explorer saved

30
00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.879
folder of the Unreal Engine project.

31
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.780
To locate this easily, I'm going to go to the content folder and then right-click on

32
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.080
it and select SHOW AN EXPLORER.

33
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.699
This will open up the file explorer of our course project.

34
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:58.360
We want to navigate to the main project folder and then open up the SAVED folder.

35
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.920
Inside of here, at the bottom here, is an obj file named RCSCANED MESH.

36
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.639
This is the scanned mesh that was used for the solve.

37
00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.019
In the folder named RCSCAN, which is the name of our metahuman identity, we will see

38
00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.619
an obj file named CONFORMAL FACE MESH.

39
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:27.739
This is the metahuman identity conformed mesh that is of metahuman topology.

40
00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.099
Now before we move on, let's do a quick review of the steps we just covered.

41
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.339
We just went through the process of exporting the conformed mesh from the metahuman identity

42
00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.500
asset window.

43
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.360
Instead of manually fitting a metahuman preset to your scanner sculpt, you can simply use

44
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.159
the standard MESH to metahuman workflow to generate an initial metahuman identity.

45
00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.360
The benefits of this is that you can align the metahuman identity with the headscan,

46
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.039
making it easier to transfer textures from the scanned data to the identity.

47
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:07.479
To get started, you will first create an initial metahuman identity by importing and preparing

48
00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.960
the mesh.

49
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.379
Since this is an image-based solve, using a texture can help to track the facial features

50
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.379
better.

51
00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.900
Next, create a metahuman identity asset and populate it.

52
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.540
Create and track a neutral pose and run the identity solve.

53
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.460
From there, you can enable and adjust additional trackers and spend a good amount of time on

54
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.579
the eyes and mouth to get a more precise solve.

55
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:43.899
Once you are finished, submit the template mesh to the metahuman backend.

56
00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:50.159
To export the metahuman identity conformed mesh from the metahuman identity asset, in

57
00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:57.560
the command prompt, enter, mh, identity, export meshes, and the number 1.

58
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.199
Once you hit enter, in the main toolbar, select metahuman identity solve.

59
00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.740
Next, locate the conformed mesh.

60
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.079
To locate the conformed mesh, go to the File Explorer folder of the Unreal Engine project.

61
00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:20.539
In the saved folder, the obj file of the mesh that was used for the solve will include the

62
00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.919
name ScannedMesh.

63
00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.419
In the folder with the name of the metahuman identity asset, the obj file that includes

64
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.420
the name conformal face mesh will be the conformed mesh of the metahuman identity and it will

65
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.879
be of metahuman topology.

66
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.860
The next step of this workflow is to bring these meshes into your choice of 3D software

67
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.860
to inspect them.

68
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.980
And from there, you can refit any details that were lost during the solve back onto the conformed

69
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.300
mesh.

70
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.300
Let's jump into Autodesk Maya and inspect the meshes.

71
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.420
In a new Maya scene, I have added the scanned and conformed mesh obj files.

72
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:12.060
Over here in the Outliner, this is the scanned mesh, which is what was used for the solve.

73
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.180
Over here, I'm going to unhide the conformed mesh that was generated from the solve.

74
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.139
Since this is already of metahuman topology, we can use this to refit accents that may

75
00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.259
have been lost during the solve while preserving the existing polygon flow.

76
00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.340
Let's do a quick review before we move on.

77
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.740
The conformed mesh can be used to bring back volume and large accents that may have been

78
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.220
lost in the solve while preserving the existing polygon flow.

79
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.340
Just ensure to mask and protect important polygon flow regions, such as the eyes and

80
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.220
inside of the mouth, when projecting details onto the conformed mesh.

81
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.380
Once the metahuman topology has been refitted to the scanner sculpt, this can be used with

82
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.020
the mesh to metahuman workflow using the template mesh option to generate a metahuman identity

83
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.940
that will be solved based on geometry.

84
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.699
This method will give us a more precise match and better joint positioning for lower LODs.

85
00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.980
In the next section, we will review the mesh to metahuman workflow using the template mesh

86
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:31.139
option before moving on to the next hands-on exercise where we go through the steps of

87
00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.060
this workflow.
