00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Up until now, we have explored a variety of workflows for modifying the metahuman neutral pose.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Using the DNA calibration repository allows us to do a variety of other things which we will explore in the next course.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But for now, let's wrap up our course with some tips and resources for you to use as you continue your training with metahumans and Unreal Engine.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In this final section of our course, we will go over some tips and resources that you may find helpful when adding DNA calibration to your metahuman customization workflow.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We will take a look at the latest release of the DNA calibration repository and then review some resources that are related to the topics we covered in this course.

6
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So let's jump back into Maya one last time and look at a script from the latest release of the DNA calibration repository that allows us to build a rig with textures.

7
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Back inside of Maya, in the DNA calibration folder, you will find in the examples folder a script named DNAViewerBuildRigWithTextures.

8
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This script allows users to generate a functional rig in Maya with applied textures.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The assets this uses are located in the data folder.

10
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This script has already been configured to load the eta DNA file from the mh4 folder.

11
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I have already assembled eta with Oliver Textures.

12
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
To use this script, ensure that DirectX11 has been enabled.

13
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To do this, go to Preferences, Display, and then to Viewport 2.0 and ensure the rendering engine is set to DirectX11.

14
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In a new Python window, with the entire script pasted in here, ensure that you have assigned the path for the root directory pointing to the DNA calibration folder.

15
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If you wish to use this with your own character, scroll down here and assign the paths for the DNA file and the maps folder.

16
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Then select this entire script and execute it.

17
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now, let's review these steps before we move on.

18
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The latest update of the DNA calibration repository includes support for Maya 2024 and the DNAViewerBuildRigWithTextures script located in the examples folder.

19
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This script allows users to generate a functional rig with applied textures.

20
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In Maya, ensure that DirectX11 is enabled.

21
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
To do this, go to Preferences, Display, Viewport 2.0, and select DirectX11.

22
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In the script editor, paste the entire script in a new Python window.

23
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Assign the root directory to point to the DNA calibration folder and then execute the entire script.

24
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This will load a fully functional rig with textures.

25
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, let's finish off with some resources for you to use.

26
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
All of the online resources and links to some of the tools discussed today can be found by following the URLs on this slide.

27
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference.

28
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You will find the links to the DNA calibration repository on GitHub, the Mesh to MetaHuman tutorial on the Unreal Engine YouTube channel,

29
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the UnrealFest 2022 scan and texture-based workflow presentation, and the 2023 DNA calibration deep dive presentation.

30
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This brings us to the end of the MetaHuman fitting and DNA calibration course.

31
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In the next course, we will continue by exploring more advanced use cases using the DNA calibration library.

32
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We will also go through the steps of bringing the modified assets back into Unreal Engine in order to finalize the changes of our MetaHuman characters.

33
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I want to thank you for spending your time with me, and I hope that these videos help you as you continue working with MetaHumans in Unreal Engine.

34
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Thank you for watching.
