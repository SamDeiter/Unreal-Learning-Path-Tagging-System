00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
Hello and welcome to MetaHuman Fitting and DNA Calibration.

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.320
My name is Gabriela Crusenio-Tacis and I will be your host for this course.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.080
In this course, we will be going over recommended workflows that can be used to modify and customize

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.760
the neutral pose of the MetaHuman face using the MetaHuman Framework Toolset.

5
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.879
Due to the number of workflows that are involved on this topic,

6
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:32.320
this class has been split up into two courses.

7
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.799
The next course, MetaHuman DNA Calibration and Finalization,

8
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:44.719
will be the continuation of this course where we explore more advanced use cases using DNA calibration

9
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.480
and go over how we can bring the modified assets back into Unreal Engine.

10
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.640
It is worth noting that the DNA calibration workflows we will be covering in both courses

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.920
have changed in later Engine versions and we will be exploring those changes in a future update.

12
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.359
In this course, we begin by exploring the complexity of the MetaHuman face and MetaHuman Framework Tools

13
00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:19.040
such as the DNA calibration repository that can be used for making adjustments to the neutral pose.

14
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:27.600
We then touch upon expectations as to how far customizations can be pushed before encountering issues.

15
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.240
Next, we will cover common workflows for fitting MetaHuman topology to scan our sculpted meshes.

16
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240
From there, we move on to two hands-on exercises.

17
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.880
In the first one, we will export a MetaHuman identity conformed mesh from Unreal Engine to be used for additional fitting.

18
00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:54.959
And for the second one, we will use the mesh to MetaHuman workflow with the template mesh option

19
00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.319
to generate a MetaHuman identity that will be solved based on geometry.

20
00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:07.120
From there, we will delve into best practices for fitting the additional head geometry assets.

21
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.759
Then we move on to the DNA calibration section of this course.

22
00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.000
We will cover setting up the DNA calibration repository

23
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.479
and we'll get acquainted with the files and scripts that we will be using.

24
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:27.840
We will use the example script from the repository to modify the neutral pose inside of Autodesk Maya.

25
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.639
We will make some minor adjustments directly on the head mesh and with the joints and skin clusters.

26
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:40.879
Then we will update the MetaHuman DNA and export the head LODs as FBX.

27
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.360
Finally, we will wrap up this course with some final recommendations

28
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.720
and I will share some tips and resources for you to use

29
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.760
as you continue your work and training with MetaHumans.

30
00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.400
This course will be using the project MEH9130055 and there are two level maps.

31
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.920
Both maps are located in the content browser under the courses folder labeled MEH21302

32
00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:19.519
in the course maps folder. The first map is named MEH21302MAPS

33
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.479
which should load automatically. S stands for Standard MetaHuman.

34
00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.879
In this map we have two versions of the preset LENA.

35
00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.039
We have the original version and the version that has been modified

36
00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:37.039
using the 2023 UnrealFest DNA calibration script.

37
00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.199
The second map is named MEH21302MAPC for Custom.

38
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.479
I will double click on this to open it.

39
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.159
This map has a stylized MetaHuman named Atomic Savage

40
00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.519
that has been customized using more advanced DNA calibration scripts.

41
00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.759
The assets that we will be using in this project are located in the course assets folder.

42
00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:11.519
The folder named ATOMICSAnom contains a body animation that has been retargeted to this character.

43
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.480
The folder named CONFORMEDMASH contains the fitted conformed mesh that we will use for

44
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.439
one of the hands-on exercises. The folder named SEQUENCES contains two level sequences you can

45
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:31.839
play that include a body and face animation. The ATOMICS sequence can be used in the map

46
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.479
with ATOMICSavage and the sequence labeled LENADNA can be used in the map with the modified version

47
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:46.079
of LENA. The source files folder named 21302 FITTADNA assets will contain the assets that

48
00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:51.120
have been used for the modified MetaHumans in both maps if you wish to inspect them.

49
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:57.120
If at any point you need to reference the location of the course maps,

50
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.199
they can be found at the beginning of the slide deck after the training outline.

51
00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:06.719
As we go through this course you will find that many slides in this presentation

52
00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.799
contain a lot of information and I will summarize all of that. But if at any point you want to read

53
00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:19.919
what is on each of those slides, feel free to pause and dive right in. Now let's begin with the first

54
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:28.079
portion of this course by exploring the complexity of the MetaHuman face, DNA calibration, and expectations

55
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.079
for achieving likeness.
