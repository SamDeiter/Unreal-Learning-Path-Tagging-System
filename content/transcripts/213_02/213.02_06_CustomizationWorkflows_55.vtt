1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
In this portion of our course, we will explore various workflows that can be used to make

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.120
changes to the metahuman neutral pose.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.080
We begin with pipeline considerations for achieving likeness using DNA calibration.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.080
Then we cover different approaches for fitting metahuman topology to face scan data and sculpted

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.960
3D head meshes.

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.320
From there, we move on to two hands-on exercises.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.480
For the first exercise, we will export a metahuman identity-conformed mesh from Unreal Engine

8
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.240
that can be used for additional fitting.

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.280
For the second one, we will solve a metahuman identity based on geometry using the mesh-to-metahuman

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.879
workflow with the template mesh option.

11
00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.320
We then delve into best practices for fitting the metahuman head geometry and its additional

12
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.719
assets, such as the eyes, eyelashes, and so on, to our target delta.

13
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.359
Let's begin by exploring workflows for achieving likeness using 3D sculpted head meshes and

14
00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:09.519
face scan data.

15
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:15.519
In this section, we begin by looking at pipeline considerations for achieving likeness using

16
00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:18.180
DNA calibration.

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.460
We then delve into different approaches for fitting metahuman topology to face scan data

18
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.560
and sculpted 3D head meshes.

19
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.880
To finalize changes that have been made to the metahuman neutral pose, metahuman DNA

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.460
needs to be updated before bringing the modified assets back into Unreal Engine.

21
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
To do this, we can use the DNA calibration toolset.

22
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.299
The main step we will see when working with either scan or sculpted mesh workflows is

23
00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.019
that metahuman DNA will need to be recalibrated before bringing any changes back into Unreal

24
00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:56.299
Engine.

25
00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.699
One of the reasons is due to the relationship the vertex and joint positions have with each

26
00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:02.859
other.

27
00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.379
Each joint name has a value assigned as a vertex index.

28
00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.859
Once we start to work with DNA calibration, you will notice two commands we will be running,

29
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.980
which is to save the current vertex and joint positions, then update the vertex and joints

30
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.060
to their new positions, and save those changes to the DNA.

31
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.940
The images in the top right demonstrate the surface joint positions before and after they

32
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.060
have been updated once the vertex positions have been changed.

33
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.060
Surface joints are responsible for preserving volume, especially for lower LODs.

34
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.340
So once a change is made to the vertex positions, using commands, we are able to snap the surface

35
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.219
joints to their new vertex positions so that the volume is preserved.

36
00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.860
Simply put, when making changes to the vertex positions or joint positions, the DNA file

37
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.500
needs to account for these changes by updating the behavior and geometry layer of the DNA

38
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.620
file.

39
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.939
When we do this so that when we bring our finalized rig back into Unreal Engine, along

40
00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.020
with the updated DNA file, it will behave correctly.

41
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.099
Now, let's take a look at pipeline considerations when working with a face skin or sculpted

42
00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.340
head mesh.

43
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.500
When working with a head sculpt, the focus will be on fitting the metahuman topology

44
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.860
to the sculpt first, and then fitting the additional face geometry assets to it.

45
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.380
The first step would be to select a metahuman preset and wrap the LOD0 head topology to

46
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.140
the head sculpt.

47
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.940
The second step would be to use the mesh to metahuman workflow with the template mesh

48
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.100
option to create a metahuman identity that is solved based on geometry, as this will

49
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.620
get the geometry and joints closer to the target delta.

50
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.060
This differs from the standard mesh to metahuman workflow, which solves a metahuman identity

51
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.620
based on image and how the tracking markers are positioned.

52
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.460
The third step would be to refit any details that may have been lost from the solve, and

53
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.100
then manually fit all of the additional face geometry assets to the metahuman identity

54
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.379
head mesh vertex by vertex.

55
00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.459
This is the most time consuming portion of this workflow.

56
00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:34.699
The fourth step would be to use DNA calibration to update the vertex and joint positions

57
00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.099
and save those changes to the DNA file.

58
00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:44.539
The head LODs can then be exported as FBX, along with the new DNA file.

59
00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.860
And the final step would be to bring the modified assets back into Unreal Engine and configure

60
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.579
the new assets.

61
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:57.219
This workflow chart represents what a pipeline might look like, and it is not a hard roadmap

62
00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.019
as the steps may vary depending on a pipeline's needs.

63
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.459
Now, let's take a look at how this workflow may differ if using face scan data.

64
00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:12.899
For face scan data, the focus may be more on transferring the texture maps correctly

65
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.579
by aligning the head geometry with the original face scan.

66
00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:22.899
Step one would be to use the standard mesh to metahuman workflow to create an initial

67
00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:28.539
metahuman identity that is solved based on image, which relies on where the tracking markers

68
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.300
are placed on the facial features.

69
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.900
This would align the head geometry with the scan in order to transfer the textures.

70
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.300
Step two would be to export the conformed mesh from the metahuman identity asset and

71
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.700
refit any details that were lost from the solve.

72
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.900
Step three would be to use the mesh to metahuman workflow with the template mesh option in

73
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.259
order to get the geometry and joints closer to the target delta.

74
00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:02.740
And step four would be to use this new metahuman identity to refit any lost details and then

75
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.180
fit the additional head geometry assets.

76
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.539
Step five would be to update the changes to the vertex and joint positions and save those

77
00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:19.099
changes to the DNA and then export the head LODs as FBX bundled with the new DNA file.

78
00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:25.099
Step six would be to finalize the rig by bringing the modified assets into Unreal Engine and

79
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.820
then configure them.

80
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.700
The process of transferring textures is not included in this workflow chart.

81
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.820
As mentioned, these charts are not a hard roadmap.

82
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.180
They simply demonstrate different approaches for fitting and that by adding DNA calibration

83
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.540
to a workflow, this ensures that the metahuman DNA file will take into account changes that

84
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.180
have been made to the neutral pose.

85
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.020
And once those changes have been brought back into Unreal Engine, the metahuman face will

86
00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:56.079
behave correctly.

87
00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:02.419
In the next section, we will delve into approaches for fitting metahuman topology to a skin or

88
00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.500
sculpted mesh.
