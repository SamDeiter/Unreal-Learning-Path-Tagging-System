00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this section, we will go over the Propagate changes from Scene to DNA script.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This script allows us to save the deltas between the current and new vertex and joint positions of meshes,

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then saves those changes to the DNA file.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We will look at two simple use case scenarios using this script to edit the neutral pose.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In the first scenario, we will make some simple changes to the vertex positions,

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and in the second scenario, we will make some minor modeling changes using the joints and skin clusters.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, let's jump into Maya and begin by taking a look at the script and going over the workflow.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Inside of Maya, I have taken the Propagate changes from Scene to DNA script from the examples folder,

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and I have pasted it in the script editor in a new Python window.

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This has step-by-step instructions at the beginning.

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
To summarize the workflow for using this script, begin by loading the DNA file in a new Maya scene using the DNA viewer run in Maya script.

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Then, save the current vertex and joint positions, make modifications to the neutral pose,

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and once finished, set the new vertex and joint positions, and update the DNA file to include those changes.

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
To use the script, we will have to input the paths of the files we want to use.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If we scroll down to line 50, here we will input the name of the DNA file we are going to use.

16
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If I go to the DNA files folder, this is the same name of the DNA file I want to use.

17
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You can use Ada or Taro as those are already in the DNA files folder.

18
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Next, we will need to specify the root directory where the DNA calibration repository is located.

19
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In my case, it's in my C drive.

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Something to note is that the backward slash needs to be replaced with a forward slash.

21
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The output path is created through commands, and it will by default be named output.

22
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is where our modified DNA file will be saved.

23
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Some of these paths we do not need to worry about as they are already set up for us,

24
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
such as the path of the DNA files folder and the analog GUI folder.

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
As mentioned earlier, if we wish to use the newer version of MetaHumans with the additional face controls,

26
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we would change the path of the GUI and additional assembly script to point to those assets in the MH4 folder.

27
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You would add MH4 forward slash here for the GUI, and then do the same for the assembly script path.

28
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If you do not use the older version of MetaHuman, you can replace the GUI file

29
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and the additional assembly script file from the MH4 folder with those in the main data folder

30
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
so that you do not have to keep updating the paths for these, which is what I have done.

31
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is the only input that is needed for this script.

32
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now, before we use this script, let's do a quick review of what we just covered.

33
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We can use the Propagate changes from Scene to DNA script to edit the neutral pose.

34
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
This script records the current vertex and joint positions for all meshes.

35
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Once changes are made, it saves the delta between those two states and updates the DNA file.

36
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The workflow is as follows.

37
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
First, run the commands that save the current vertex and joint positions of the head mesh.

38
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Then, make modifications to the neutral mesh.

39
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
When finished, run the rest of the commands to set the new vertex and joint positions,

40
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and then update the DNA file to include those changes.

41
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
For the script input, on line 50, enter the name of the DNA file you wish to edit.

42
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
For the root directory, enter the path that points to the DNA calibration folder

43
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and make sure you use a forward slash.

44
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Then, update the paths for the GUI and additional assembly script

45
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to point to the MH4 folder if using the newer versions of MetaHumans.

46
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now that we have an idea of the workflow and what input we need to use,

47
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in the next section we will go through executing the various commands and will edit the neutral pose.
