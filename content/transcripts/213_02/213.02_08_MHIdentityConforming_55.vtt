00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the previous section, we covered fitting metahuman topology to metahuman presets.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Another approach is to use the Mesh to Metahuman workflow, with the standard Mesh or Template Mesh option also referred to as Conformed Mesh.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this section, we will review some important terminology that relates to metahuman identity conforming,

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and go over what a metahuman identity asset is, what conforming means and how it works, what exporting the conformed mesh means and how it can be used.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A metahuman identity asset contains the template of a head mesh and a reference to the matching rig that is generated from the input source data such as a scanner sculpt.

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Conforming refers to the process of configuring the metahuman identity to approximate the volume that is found from the metahuman preset database.

7
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The results may not match the source data precisely as this process uses the metahuman standard topology.

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The conformed mesh of the metahuman identity that has been generated can be exported directly from the metahuman identity asset window, locally on the user's workstation.

9
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Since this is of metahuman topology, it can be used for refitting any lost details to the scanner sculpt.

10
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In the next section, we will go through a hands-on exercise where we will export the conformed mesh from the metahuman identity asset window.
