00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
In this portion of our course, we begin by looking at the complexity of the metahuman

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.279
face.

3
00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:16.800
Then, we delve into metahuman DNA, the DNA calibration repository, and go over expectations

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.280
for achieving likeness with our characters.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.879
Let's get started by first exploring the complexity of the metahuman face.

6
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.519
In this section of our course, we begin by looking at the complexity of the metahuman

7
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.879
face.

8
00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:38.280
We will take a look at the metahuman face component and its associated assets, including

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.879
all of its geometry and how these work with rig logic.

10
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.320
Let's begin by answering the question, what is the metahuman framework?

11
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.159
The metahuman framework is a single product made up of a variety of collaborating parts,

12
00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.259
carefully designed to work together seamlessly.

13
00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:06.640
The assets that make up the metahuman framework include the body and head meshes, skeletons

14
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.240
and control rigs, animation blueprints, materials and animated maps, clothing, grooms, metahuman

15
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.039
DNA and rig logic.

16
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.100
In this course, we are focused on one of those assets, the metahuman face.

17
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.780
The face is tied to all of these assets, and for this reason, a few things should be considered

18
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.280
when making modifications to the neutral pose so that it behaves correctly.

19
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.680
The metahuman face component is made up of several assets.

20
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.360
Let's take a look at the head geometry first.

21
00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.159
Inside of Maya, we can see the assets that make up the head geometry.

22
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.640
These meshes include the head, the teeth, the saliva, the left and right eye, the eye

23
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.640
shell, the eyelashes, the eye edge and cartilage.

24
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.379
And each of these have their own LODs.

25
00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.039
There are also the joints, skin clusters and blend shapes.

26
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:17.159
Now let's take a look at the assets that make up the metahuman face component in Unreal

27
00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.400
Engine.

28
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.799
In Unreal Engine, the face component assets include the skeleton, the skeletal mesh, animation

29
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.879
sequences, animation blueprints and the face pose process animation blueprint.

30
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.000
As we saw in the metahuman blueprint and animation course, the face pose process animation blueprint

31
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.520
is where the rig logic node lives, and is responsible for triggering the animated blood

32
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.159
flow and normal maps.

33
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.599
Now let's delve into rig logic a bit more.

34
00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:02.879
Rig logic is a runtime, facial rig evaluation solver system developed by 3Lateral and has

35
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:10.280
taken over a decade's worth of research and development to parameterize the human face.

36
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.719
It relies on a universal set of rules for defining the muscular system of the face and utilizes

37
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.159
the proprietary file format called metahuman DNA.

38
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.400
At the core of facial animation, the important elements that the metahuman face rig includes

39
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.439
are the joint and skin weight deformers, blend shape deformers, base and animated texture

40
00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:42.319
setups, the rig logic plugin and metahuman DNA, the user interface of the face control

41
00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.840
rig and built in LODs.

42
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.039
In simpler terms, rig logic is what allows animations to be shared by all metahumans

43
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:59.400
and LODs, while working under the hood to activate blend shapes, corrective blend shapes,

44
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.599
joint transforms and animated maps.

45
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.359
Now we have just gone over the assets that make up the metahuman face.

46
00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.319
In the next section, we will take a closer look at metahuman DNA.
