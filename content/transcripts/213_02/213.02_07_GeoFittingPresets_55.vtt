00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.439
In this section, we will delve into fitting metahuman topology to scan in sculpted meshes.

2
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:14.960
One approach is to use the metahuman presets for fitting metahuman topology to a target

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.120
delta.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.359
And another approach is to use the standard mesh to metahuman workflow to generate an

5
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.800
identity.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.839
We will first explore using metahuman presets for fitting and how the metahuman identity

7
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.159
texture can be a helpful reference for the fitting process.

8
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:39.200
The goal of fitting is to first wrap metahuman topology to a scanner sculpt as this will

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.359
be the target delta.

10
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.000
From there, that asset can be used with the mesh to metahuman workflow using the template

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.079
mesh option to generate a metahuman identity whose geometry and joints are closer to the

12
00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.719
target delta.

13
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.240
Begin by going to the metahuman creator and selecting a preset.

14
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.719
Then download the metahuman source assets from the Quixel Bridge standalone application

15
00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.280
and using the LOD0 head mesh from the Maya scene, fit it to the model.

16
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.640
The metahuman identity texture can be used as a reference during the fitting process.

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.680
When fitting important polygon flow transitions, the metahuman identity texture can be a helpful

18
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200
reference.

19
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.439
It can be found inside of Unreal Engine by going to all, plugins, metahuman content,

20
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.120
identity template.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.600
In the material named metahuman identity head, you can locate the texture there and export

22
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.680
it.

23
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.159
Some important polygon flow transition regions include the eyes, particularly the inner edge

24
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.680
of the eyelid.

25
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.480
For the mouth area, pay close attention to the inner and outer vermilion and the contact

26
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.920
edge of the lips, as well as the transition regions of the nose bridge and middle of the

27
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.200
neck.

28
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.280
Now that we have a better idea of how we can approach fitting metahuman topology using

29
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.759
metahuman presets, in the next section we will review some important terminology that

30
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.319
relates to metahuman identity conforming before delving into fitting metahuman topology using

31
00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.159
the mesh to metahuman workflow.
