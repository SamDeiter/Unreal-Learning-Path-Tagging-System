00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.599
When finalizing customizations to the MetaHuman Neutral Pose, DNA calibration can be used

2
00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.320
for updating MetaHuman DNA.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.480
In this portion of our course, we delve into setting up the MetaHuman DNA calibration library.

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.359
So let's get started with the requirements for using the library and how to set it up.

5
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.039
In this section, we will be setting up the DNA calibration library.

6
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.719
We will also look at the folder contents and become acquainted with some of the scripts.

7
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.240
First, let's review the instructions and requirements for using the repository.

8
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.599
To get started with setting up the DNA calibration repository, sign in to GitHub and then locate

9
00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:48.599
the MetaHuman DNA calibration repository.

10
00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.200
Next, download the latest release and then unzip the folder.

11
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.760
Place the DNA calibration folder in a desired location.

12
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.800
In my case, I saved it to my C drive.

13
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.320
Next, go to Edit Environmental Variables and create a new variable named Maya Module Path

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.520
in all caps as shown on the slide.

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.320
Then set the path location of the DNA calibration folder as the variable value.

16
00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:24.479
Python 3.9 or higher is required for Maya versions 2023 or later,

17
00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.519
and the Quixel Bridge Maya plugin needs to be installed.

18
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:33.439
Now that we have reviewed the setups and requirements, let's go over the folders and

19
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.039
files of the repository.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.560
Inside of the DNA calibration folder, the main files we will be using are located in the Data

21
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.960
folder and Examples folder.

22
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.960
The Data folder contains the files that are needed to load the DNA.

23
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.840
The Body folder is where the prepared skeleton Maya files are placed,

24
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.320
and the DNA files folder is where the DNA files are placed.

25
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.240
Other important files include the GUI and Analog GUI Maya scenes and the additional assembly script.

26
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.359
At the time of the release of MetaHuman Animator in 2023,

27
00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:16.000
the number of joints and expressions increased with the latest version of MetaHuman.

28
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:22.799
The MH4 folder contains the GUI scene and assembly script for these current rigs.

29
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.319
Update the paths in the scripts you use so that they switch to the new rig version.

30
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.199
The Examples folder contains scripts with common commands.

31
00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.679
We will be looking at the DNA viewer run in Maya script,

32
00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.759
the grab changes from scene and propagate to DNA script,

33
00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.079
and the export FBX script.

34
00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.919
The Unreal Fest script is also included in the repository.

35
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:53.280
And you will find the Assets and Scripts showcased at the Unreal Fest

36
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.560
MetaHuman DNA calibration deep dive presentation.

37
00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.000
Now let's review the scripts that we will be using.

38
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.520
The three scripts that we will be using are located in the Examples folder.

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The DNA viewer run in Maya script allows you to use a GUI window in Maya

40
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.319
to create a scene with a functional rig.

41
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.719
We can use this to load a DNA file and view the MetaHuman face inside of Maya.

42
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.439
The grab changes from scene and propagate to DNA script

43
00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.560
allows you to transfer changes from the Maya scene to the DNA file.

44
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.280
If we want to adjust the head geometry, we can first save the current state,

45
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.319
make our changes, and then save those changes and update the DNA file.

46
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.439
The export FBX script allows you to generate a functional rig in a new Maya scene,

47
00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.120
and then export the head LODs as FBX files.

48
00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:57.120
All of the scripts in the Examples folder contain step-by-step instructions at the beginning.

49
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.920
In the Unreal Fest Script folder, you will find that these scripts

50
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.640
include a combination of different functions bundled into one script,

51
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.200
including commands from the Examples folder.

52
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.879
In the next section, we will go through a few simple use case scenarios

53
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.879
for using the DNA calibration library with Autodesk Maya.
