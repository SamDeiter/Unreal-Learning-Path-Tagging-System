00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
In this section, we will go over the final fitting process before DNA calibration is

2
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.160
used.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.560
We will go over how to assemble and prepare the assets for fitting.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.280
In the following section, we will continue with best practices for the final fitting

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
process.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.199
The goal of the fitting process is to get the head geometry and the additional assets

7
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.440
fitted as close to the target delta as possible.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.240
In by downloading the source assets of your character from the Quixel Bridge standalone

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.920
application.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.439
Then assemble the necessary geometry for the final fitting process.

11
00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.680
If you would like to inspect the assets in the Maya scene I will be showing, it is located

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.140
in the source files folder of our course, inside of the atomic savage folder, in the

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.000
folder named Modeling Assets.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.859
Now let's jump into Maya to review the assets.

15
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.200
Inside of the Maya scene named Atomic S01 fitting, over here on the left in the Outliner

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.799
you will find all of the assets that have been used for this character.

17
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.379
The first group over here named Original Metahuman Creator contains the Atomic Savage head geometry

18
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.840
assembled from the source assets.

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.439
This includes the head LOD2 and LOD0 along with all of the LOD0 additional assets.

20
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.680
I'm going to bring the head mesh closer to view to show you that for this version the

21
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.359
region influence has been used on the eye area.

22
00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:42.680
In the Outliner, right below this there is a version of the head geometry that demonstrates

23
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.840
what the polygon flow of the eye area looks like without using the region influence.

24
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.000
Now let's take a look at the original ZBrush head sculpt.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.260
Over here in this group named ZBrush Initial Fitting, this mesh here is the original head

26
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.320
sculpt and here we have the version that the Metahuman Topology has been fitted to.

27
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.900
This asset is the target delta.

28
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.080
Now the assets that would need to be assembled in a new Maya scene include the fitted mesh,

29
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.080
this here is a copy of it and I will hide it for now along with all of these right below

30
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.720
that I am selecting.

31
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.760
These assets include the head LOD0 mesh and the head LOD2 mesh.

32
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.360
The LOD2 mesh is used for easier fitting and manipulating polygons.

33
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.120
Then we have all of the LOD assets which include the teeth, the saliva, the eye shell, the

34
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.000
eye right, the eye left, the cartilage, the eyelashes and the eye edge.

35
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.240
Finally over here we have a copy of the left and right eye.

36
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.920
With the assets assembled, the next step is to prepare these assets for the final fitting

37
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.080
process.

38
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.800
I am going to hide the fitted head until we meet it.

39
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.200
Something to note is that the following steps I will show have already been performed but

40
00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.119
I will go through them in order to demonstrate what this process looks like.

41
00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.759
So let's begin by preparing these assets for fitting.

42
00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:26.639
The first step is to wrap all of the additional assets and the head LOD2 to the head LOD0

43
00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.839
mesh.

44
00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:37.839
To do this, select head LOD2 and all of the additional assets first, then select LOD0.

45
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.360
Next go up here to deform, then go to wrap and open up the wrap options.

46
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.159
Leave everything at default and select apply.

47
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.640
As mentioned, these steps have already been performed, I am just demonstrating these for

48
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.000
you.

49
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.400
The second step is to blend shape the head LOD and wrapped assets to the fitted head.

50
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.199
To do this I will unhide the fitted head mesh.

51
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:11.399
Now select the fitted head mesh first and then select head LOD0 that everything has

52
00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:18.360
been wrapped to, then go up here to deform and go to blend shape and open up the blend

53
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.199
shape options.

54
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.120
Leave everything at default and apply.

55
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.439
Now if I press G to bring up the shape editor, we can use the slider to inspect the result

56
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.759
of the blend shape.

57
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:45.720
As a best practice, select all of these assets and then go to mesh display up here and select

58
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.159
unlock normals and then select soften edge.

59
00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.560
Now I am going to hide the fitted head again.

60
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.280
If we inspect these assets, such as the eye shell, I will bring this closer to view.

61
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.160
These will need to be adjusted vertex by vertex to the fitted head mesh.

62
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.160
I am going to hide the eye shell and select the right and left eye.

63
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.959
These have been warped from the wrapping process, hence this is why we keep a copy of the eyes.

64
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.839
If you wish to inspect the final fitted assets, they are in the group labeled final fitted

65
00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.239
head additional geo.

66
00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.680
Now we have just gone over the assembly and preparation process for the final fitting

67
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680
process.

68
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.039
Let's do a quick review of the steps we just covered before moving on.

69
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.279
The goal of the final fitting process is to fit the metahuman identity solve and its

70
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:53.359
additional head geometry assets to the fitted LOD0 head mesh.

71
00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:59.239
To get started, begin by assembling the assets that will be needed for the final fitting.

72
00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:03.599
Download the source assets from the Quixel Bridge standalone application and assemble

73
00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.359
the head geometry in a new scene.

74
00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:13.559
The meshes include the original LOD0 head mesh of the 3D model which is the target delta,

75
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.240
and the metahuman identity solve, the LOD2 head mesh and the LOD0 head mesh along with

76
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.879
all of the additional LOD0 head geometry assets which include the teeth, the saliva, the eye

77
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:33.040
shell, the left and right eye, the cartilage, the eyelashes and the eye edge.

78
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.879
With everything assembled, the next step is to prepare the assets for fitting.

79
00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.319
The first step is to wrap everything to the LOD0 head mesh.

80
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:49.000
Select the LOD2 head mesh and the additional assets, then select the LOD0 head mesh.

81
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.839
Go to deform and select wrap.

82
00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:59.560
The reason why we wrap LOD0 and LOD2 is because LOD2 makes it easier for fitting and manipulating

83
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.120
polygons.

84
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.560
Subdividing LOD2 results in LOD0.

85
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.000
Once everything has been wrapped to LOD0, the next step is to create a blend shape between

86
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.160
the wrapped assets and the fitted 3D head model.

87
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.800
To blend shape the wrapped assets to the fitted 3D head model, first select the fitted head

88
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.199
model and then select the LOD0 head mesh.

89
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.800
Then go to deform and select blend shape.

90
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.639
As a best practice, you can unlock the normals and soften the edges by selecting the wrapped

91
00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:41.959
geometry, then going to mesh display and selecting unlock normals and soften edge.

92
00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:46.839
Before you create the blend shape, ensure you keep a copy of the eyes as they will become

93
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.120
deformed during the process.

94
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.479
The wrapped eyes will be used as a positional reference later on.

95
00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:58.439
We have just gone over the steps for assembling and preparing the neutral pose assets for

96
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.839
the final fitting process.

97
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:04.839
In the next section we will continue going over the final fitting process.
