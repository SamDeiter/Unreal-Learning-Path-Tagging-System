  "text": " All right, continuing from our last section, let's answer that question. Where do you need to be for real-time production with Unreal Engine? First, Unreal Engine has an open platform, so that means free public access. The entire source code for whatever version of the engine you are using internally is what you can use in your projects via GitHub. At Epic, we believe that having an open platform is critical to a more cooperative user experience. Open platforms allow for collaborative development of the base application while also allowing a robust plugin infrastructure and a unified asset format. By storing data in Unreal Engine's format, you will always be able to read your data because you have access to the source code of the program. That is not the case for most legacy applications. This means Unreal Engine is extensible and customizable. You're free to modify, extend, customize, and automate your productions with free access to the entire C++ source code. Speaking of C++, Unreal Engine also has a robust and extensive C++ API. The Blueprint visual scripting system that is highly intuitive allows artists to create code without needing to be a programmer themselves. Additionally, Python scripting helps automate repeatable actions throughout the program. Unreal Engine is the world's most open and advanced real-time 3D creation application with a comprehensive toolset that gives users everything they need to start, grow, and stand out from the crowd. Whether it's worldbuilding, animation, rendering, simulation, or gameplay, Unreal Engine can handle it all with a wide range of support options for all major platforms, integrated media, and developer tools. Whether you're creating a PC, AR, VR, or mixed reality experience, Unreal Engine has you covered. All this makes Unreal Engine an extremely strong centralized hub for your real-time And with a one-asset, many uses core structure, the Unreal Engine asset format can be implemented and utilized for any number of different applications. This is ideal for any animation and visual effects studio that is also looking for ways to unify the asset libraries created within their studio. Then once tied to the latest version of Unreal Engine, version 5, studios will have access to a number of new technologies to improve the look of your production. Nanite is our latest innovation in virtualized geometry systems. Lumen provides fully dynamic global illumination. Virtual textures that support up to 8K resolutions and improved spatialized audio will increase the sense of immersion in the interactive experiences. Overall, Unreal Engine is uniquely positioned to meet your creative expectations. And if you're interested in seeing what an Unreal Engine production can produce, let's end this section with a few linear content examples made with Unreal Engine. Real Effects, Super Robot Brothers, which can be viewed on Netflix, and Braun Animation's Fables are great examples of productions made entirely with Unreal Engine. As is the Meerkat short film created by Weta, located online under the URL below. Feel free to check them out at any time. OK, that's it for this section. Next is a production overview for the real-time pipeline.",
