  "text": " So let's start with the scene assembly now. Part one, we'll talk about the neutral baseline. So what does that neutral baseline mean? So this is a calibrated scene for building accurate lighting consistency. We'll do a calibrated baseline, sorry, is critical. And the principles through a tier two are disabling auto exposure. So that's making sure in the project settings or the post process volume, we disable auto exposure. We'll also disable all artistic effects such as bloom, chromatic aberration, grain, coloration, those types of effects within the post processing volume. We'll use the calibration tools and we'll avoid colorized lighting or post processing coloration until calibrated baseline is established. And then we'll add material previews to check for consistency and we'll use a high quality model and materials. So to start off with, what we'll do is we'll open the 00-start map located in the Classroom Walkthrough folder. So back in the engine, if you just remove any filters that you've got assigned, you can go down the content map list to the Classroom folder. We can go to Walkthrough and you'll find 00-start. So we can just double click that and you don't need to save any of the previous content if you've edited it. And then whilst the map's loading, we want to include collections, contain all necessary Classroom assets. So we'll go to the Content Browser, we'll go to View Options and we'll select the Doc Collections and then from Calibration Collections, we can add the Color Calibrator, the Calibration Blueprint and also the Static Mesh Shader Ball. And then from the Place Axis Panel, we'll add a Skylight, a Directional Light and a Post Process Volume. So let's go ahead and do that now. So when the scene is loaded up, the 00-start, just go into Unlit Mode for a second and just make sure your camera is in a place where you can see the scene. And then you want to go to the Collections tab at the bottom left here. You want to find the Classroom tab, go to Calibration and we'll add the BP Calibration, sorry, we'll add the Calibrator and we'll add the Shader Ball as well and just allow those shaders to build. And then from our Place Axis tab, we will go to the Lights, we will add a Skylight, Directional Light and also a Post Process Volume. So we can just type in Post Process on the search bar and then drag in a Post Process Volume. So we'll keep things nice and organized if we pan to the side of the car here. We'll put our Color Calibrator here, we'll put the Calibration Tool here just next to it and we'll just bring everything into view, just keep things nice and organized, maybe we'll take that a little bit more camera facing. The Post Process Volume is fine just anywhere in the back, I'll lift the light out of place. Right, because it's not directional, that can just be above and then we'll move the Shader Ball over to the side and maybe we'll duplicate this maybe four or five times holding down the Alt key and just click drag, hold down Alt, drag, Alt, drag, Alt, drag, just so we have some basic scenes set up here. Next we want to make sure our Post Process Volume is set to neutral. We essentially do this by changing these four properties. So the intent here is to disable auto exposure essentially and all the artistic effects as we mentioned before. So we'll talk about the Bloom Chromatic Calibration fill grain, we'll add our artistic effects with another Post Process that overrides this later in the course. So we just want to make sure infinite extent unbound, just make sure the Post Process affects the entire scene. So the Min and Max EV just clamps it to one essentially so we don't get any auto exposure and then we want exposure compensation around minus 5.5. So let's go ahead and change those in the editor. So we'll select the Post Process Volume, type unbound and we'll tick that, we'll go to Min and we'll tick exposure on Min and clamp that to one. We'll go to type Max, Max EV set to one and then we'll type compensation and we'll tick that and we'll do minus 5.5. And we can just go into lit mode as well just to make sure everything is there. So minus 5.5 for me isn't working too well so I'm just going to go to maybe a minus 3, let's see minus 3, maybe a minus 1, maybe a 0. So yeah essentially just compensate the exposure to whatever works for you. I've just set it to minus 1 here and then once we've set the exposure we just want the automotive materials selected for our content browser. So we've duplicated the shader ball already and we're just going to apply the various automotive materials. So you can see the car paint in the automotive materials here and we just want to set the elements as the different car paints in the shader balls. So back in our editor, we'll click condensed collections down now, we'll go back into our project, we'll go to the automotive materials, we'll select the material here and we'll just apply some of these materials to the shader balls. So when I click on the shader ball just delete any such information you might have put in there and we'll just assign some of these car paints here. So we've got the trim there, we've got another left in material, zooming in a little bit, we've got the chrome ball and we've got the glass as well and we'll just build those shaders out now. And then we just want to make sure we set our skylight and our directional light properties. So skylight is going to cast global ambient light into the scene using HDRI. The SLS capture scene, if your skylight is added before the lighting it will cast black lighting so we want to recapture the light after lighting has been added and then we'll use a specific cube map here which is the small hanger 01 4K from the collections HDRI. So we can go back down to our collections and then the skylight details panel we want to set the mobility to movable, cube map resolution to 512 or 1024, intensity at 30 and the lower hemisphere is solid color unchecked. So let's go ahead and do that now, jump in editor. So when we go to the skylight I will select it in our outlining here and we'll make sure we set the cube map first. So I'll just give us a bit more real estate. Well first of all we should set this to movable actually so let's go to all and just set movable on the skylight. The SLS captured scene is fine, let's go to our cube map so our cube map should be in our collections down here. If we just give ourselves a bit more real estate, close this down, HDRI. If you've got any filters on just make sure you remove that filter. So we've got the small hangar 01 4K here which we'll assign here. So we'll just set the cube map to specify the cube map, we'll plug that cube map in and then the cube map resolution we want it as 512 and the intensity scale was at 30 and then in advanced the lower hemisphere is solid color, you can leave that unchecked there. So making sure now we adjust our exposure, let's go back to our post process volume, the compensation, let's put that back down to minus 5.5, we get some good exposure there and now let's sort our directional light out. So our directional light property 0 as follows, this is for previewing our scene and we'll be replacing this but in the details panel we want to make sure mobility is movable and intensity is 300 lux. So then going to our directional light, just remove any filters that we've got going on, we want movable and then intensity is 300 and again this is just for preview purposes, I will be removing this after. So essentially we've set up our scene, we've got all the components, you could rotate this directional light around a little bit just to help you preview things a little bit more just so you don't have any dark shadowing going on but that's essentially our basic scene set up to begin assembly. And just to give you a brief overview of the entire assembly that we've got going on, this is your main viewport image with some materials assigned to the shader balls here and then we've got our calibration tools set up ready for use, our content browser was that we use these calibration tools, we placed some actors using the skylight and the directional light, we also found a post process volume and we've got everything organised in our world outlining here just to keep things tidy.",
