  "text": " I'd like us to spend as much time in Unreal Engine as possible, but let's begin today's class just by reviewing the topics we'll be covering, as well as the project we'll be operating in, and just some basic understanding of how light operates in Unreal Engine. So some of these topics will include the lighting terminology of Unreal Engine, the different types and the different mobility they can have, a basic scene setup for how we actually just make sure we can see what we're doing, a static daylight setup that includes a skylight as well as a sunlight, looking at how to use HDRIs, exploring using a dynamic sun system, which will include geolocating us and making sure the sun is operating as we'd expect it to in the real world, setting up a night scene, which will have some different light types, including IES profiles, using post-processing to control exposure, color, and other visual aspects of our scene, as well as configuring our scene for light mass and doing a bake, probably a few bakes actually. Now the project we'll be working in is an adaptation of Xavier Corbero's Labyrinth House. It's a nice simple scene that lends itself well to just testing out light and shadow, both in daytime and nighttime. And it's actually built using pretty much just the standard meshes that Unreal Engine comes with with starter content. So beginning to think about the lighting terminology, let's think about our definitions. So to start, we have direct lighting compared to indirect lighting. As you may have experienced in other DCC programs, you can have your light cast in a very direct way where you have very hard shadows, and the areas that are in shadows are essentially in total darkness. But then as soon as you start to add bounced light, where the light hits a surface and then hits another surface, that starts to give us indirect lighting and starts to brighten up some of our darker areas. And we'll often find that our skylight is very effective at keeping our shadows from being too dark. Baked or static lighting is how we can calculate all the lighting in our scene ahead of time to minimize the impact on real-time performance. Essentially what we do is we tell the objects that are not going to move and the lights that are not going to move to be static, we hit bake, and once that processing is done, we no longer have to worry about that impact on our scene's performance. Compare that with real-time or dynamic lighting, which gets updated every single frame, sometimes 60, 90, 120 times per second depending on your project, maybe at that higher level if you're in VR for example. And because this is fully dynamic and you're processing all the light and shadow in real-time, it's very expensive. But also worth noting that it doesn't necessarily look as good as static lighting because you don't get any of that bounced light we were just talking about in the last slide. You can use both of these together as well. You can have some lights and objects set to static and other ones set to movable or dynamic. And also it's worth considering that Unreal Engine has access to ray tracing, which means that we can have a very realistic scene using ray tracing settings for lighting, shadows, global illumination, ambient occlusion. We can also use path tracing for kind of a ground truth reference for how light and shadow would actually behave in the real world if we'd like to compare that to the results we're getting in real-time. But it is very expensive. Some of the light types we have access to include the directional light, which is often our sun or moon. We have our point light, also known as an omni light in some other programs, and that of course casts light and shadow from every direction. We have our spotlight, which has a cone, and we can set an inner and outer cone radius. And of course, here we deal with attenuation for how far out that light will project. We have our rectangle light, and the real benefit of that is that we can set the source width and length. So we actually have light emanating from an area. This would also be called an area light in some other programs. Our skylight, as previously mentioned, is often how we achieve our ambient lighting and help brighten up our darker areas. That can be achieved using an HDRI or the actual lighting of the scene. And that can be updated every frame, or it can be fixed and just updated once. We can also use an HDRI backdrop, which is a blueprint which allows us to select any kind of a cube map skybox as an HDRI and make sure that we are using the lighting from that image to actually light our scene. In that case, we probably wouldn't use the sun, for example, because the HDRI is doing that for us. And lastly, it is worth mentioning that we have access to the sun and sky blueprint, which automates the sun position and allows us to geolocate exactly where our scene is so that the sunlight moves and behaves as we'd expect it to for that actual location in the world. Some of the light properties we have access to include intensity, and that can use what is called unitless in Unreal Engine, where it simply has a brightness of, for example, 500. We also can change the light color here, where we pick any color we like from a color wheel, or we can actually use a Kelvin color temperature, which allows for a warmer, cooler light and looks like how light often does in the real world. Interior lighting, artificial light tends to be warmer, daylight tends to be cooler. We can also start to affect things like the attenuation, as previously mentioned, where we're deciding how far out our light should be affecting our scene. It's very important to not let your attenuation radius get too large, whether you're doing a static or dynamic light, because then you'll have calculations for areas of your project that aren't even being lit by that light. So often you'll want to pull that in so that it's only actually affecting the area that you care about. And we'll see that more when we're in Unreal Engine together. And then it's also worth mentioning, we can see things like the inverse squared falloff setting, which is right here. And if we uncheck that, we can start to have our light cast much further out with the energy dissipating less than it would in the real world. I often will do that if I'm trying to get a light to ambiently light a scene and I'm not so concerned with everyone seeing where the source of it might be from. Maybe I'm just trying to give a blue wash to the general area. And I might even turn off shadows, for example, when doing that to give you even less of a sense of the directionality of the light. And then last here is the IES profiles, which you'll often use with the spotlight or point light, just to say exactly how a bulb should behave. You can look at this wall here where we have IES profiles casting very particular light and shadows. Our light mobility settings, as alluded to before, have to do with whether you're going to bake your lighting or have it be real time, though you will notice we have three settings here. So static, of course, is for our baked lighting. We select this for any object or light that will not be moving. And once the light has actually baked, that's very, very cheap to use. We have our movable light, which is fully real time and is the most expensive but gives no indirect lighting. And then we have this center one called stationary. And this is a fascinating mobility setting because in some ways it allows us to borrow from the best of both worlds. We can bake our lighting and those stationary lights become baked. And that means that the location is fixed. We can't move where the light is. And most of the lighting settings have to remain the same. But we can change the intensity as well as the color without having to do a rebake, which allows us some level of control. For example, if you want to be able to turn a light on and off in real time and then it's still not nearly as expensive as a movable light. And you also can get some of the indirect bounced lighting that you don't get with movable because it is also a baked light. Worth noting that you do have a maximum of four overlapping stationary lights in Unreal Engine because of the complexity of allowing the adjustments of the intensity and color in real time. And if you do find yourself with a bulb that has a red X through it, that's probably what's happening and all you need to do is pull in your attenuation or maybe pull the lights further apart. Or lastly, just decide that maybe one of those lights wants to be static or movable instead of stationary. Next up, let's hop into Unreal Engine and explore some of these concepts in practice.",
