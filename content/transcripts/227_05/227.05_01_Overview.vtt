Hello, and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on the UMG fundamentals for HMI in

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
design.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.220
So today we'll be covering setting up for modularity in this scene that you can see

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.600
on the right hand side here.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.240
And we'll try to design with flexibility and ease in mind for other people using this

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
interaction.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.280
We'll talk about new ways to input and display information.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.840
We'll talk about organizing menus and also animating user interfaces.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.840
So let's jump in.
