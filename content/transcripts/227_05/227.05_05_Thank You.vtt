So thank you again for watching today's course. Hopefully it gave you a really good overview of how to use UMG in your projects, all the different powerful functionality that UMG has.

Again, just thinking about the approach in terms of controller and getting input into the controller and then setting up a camera in your scene so you can configure in this example,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a car configurator with sliders on the UMG and different button clicks and even add in some animation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So you can obviously spend hours on the styling to get exactly how you want to customize it, but hopefully you found the functionality today useful and we'll see you in the next course. Thanks.
