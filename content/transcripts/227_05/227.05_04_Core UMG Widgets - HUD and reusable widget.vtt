WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
So with that context in mind, let's now jump into creating a core UMG widget and talk about

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.640
creating a HUD and a reusable widget.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.940
So we'll jump into an engine now.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680
And when we're in engine, we'll start by creating a new HUD widget.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.880
So I've got a HMI folder here.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.680
I'll just right click and go to new folder and I'll type blueprints here because we'll

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.640
be making a few different blueprints today.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm going to right click and I'll go to user interface and then we'll go to widget blueprint

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
at the bottom here.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.560
I use a widget is fine.

11
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.720
So we'll just click that and we'll type HUD underscore UMG today.

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.800
And then we'll just hit enter to open it up.

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.240
And what I like to do is I like to just pin this next to the map here so it's a bit easier

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.180
to toggle between the two.

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.420
So now that we've created a new widget, we want to check the fill screen at the top right

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.260
of the viewport here.

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.660
So we've got fill screen here and we can set a desired screen size.

18
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.980
And so we'll do desired on screen.

19
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.340
If you'd like to set a specific screen size there, we have these options.

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.380
We can also just do a custom on screen as well.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.020
So whichever kind of aspects you want to work with, I'm just going to use 1920, 1080,

22
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.300
which is going to be my aspect on the PC, but you can set the real estate to whatever

23
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.320
you would like it to be there.

24
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.580
And then on the top left hand side, we just need a canvas panel, which we will drag down

25
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.680
into here and so that we have our canvas panel now part of our hierarchy in the bottom left

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.180
hand side here.

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.940
So we've got our basic layout.

28
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.140
We will jump into creating a new blueprint now so that we can actually add this widget

29
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.940
to some kind of class.

30
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.220
So I'm just going to compile and save.

31
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.380
Again, we're just building the foundations right now of our functionality.

32
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.180
So I'm back in my content browser.

33
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.880
I'm going to go to new blueprint class by right clicking and this time we will select

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.560
player controller.

35
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.920
And this is just going to be a display controller.

36
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.280
And what we were talking about in the PowerPoint just a few minutes ago is that we need some

37
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.680
kind of controller that can interact with the scene.

38
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.760
As you recall, controllers can take input and consume input commands.

39
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.980
So that's why we've created a controller right now.

40
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.760
So I'm going to hit enter to open it up again.

41
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.760
Alternatively, you can just double click this, but when it's already selected, you can just

42
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.360
hit enter to open.

43
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.200
I'm just going to save it just to make sure we have the save preferences.

44
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.460
And I'll go to the event graph in the top middle here.

45
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.480
So when we go to the event graph, we can delete the tick if you'd like it like to delete that.

46
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.260
Again, it doesn't really have functionality, it just cleans it up a bit.

47
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.220
And so we'll go from the event begin play, and we'll create a widget.

48
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.220
So create widget.

49
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.660
So you just draw, drag off the the white execution pin and go to create widget.

50
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.780
And we'll have something like that.

51
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.900
And then we just want to find the hood that we just created.

52
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.680
So we called it hood underscore UMG.

53
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.560
So we'll add that there.

54
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.260
And then we want to promote this to a variable.

55
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.040
So we'll drag off the blue pin and say promotes a variable.

56
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.940
And we'll call this hood underscore UMG reference, something like this.

57
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.440
It doesn't matter what the specific name is, as long as it's consistent with your naming

58
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.040
convention and that you remember what that name is for use later on.

59
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.220
And then the last thing we want to do, we've got the controller, we've created our hood

60
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.400
widget, now we just need to add it to the screen.

61
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.540
So to do that, we say add to viewport.

62
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.280
So we'll just click add to viewport.

63
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.880
And as we now add functionality to this widget, it will get added to the viewport as long

64
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.160
as we have our game mode set correctly, which we will do in the coming time here.

65
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.640
So let's create our first bit of functionality to make sure we can see our UMG display and

66
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.920
just make sure everything's working correctly.

67
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.180
So I'm going to go back into the hood UMG now.

68
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.380
I'm going to find a vertical box.

69
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.500
So I'll go to vertical box.

70
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.660
I'm going to drag and drop that down into here.

71
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.820
And so you'll see a new box has been added and we can position this wherever we would

72
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820
like.

73
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820
We can change the positioning.

74
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.180
It doesn't really matter too much for these purposes, but I'll just drag it out so you

75
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.620
can see that happening.

76
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.260
And maybe I'll make it a little bit bigger.

77
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And we want to add a text box.

78
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.540
So we'll just display some kind of text on the screen.

79
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.420
So I'll get the text box and drag and drop that down to the vertical box as well.

80
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:27.260
And then I will also add a name slot underneath that.

81
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.680
There we go.

82
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.840
So the text is just a text block there.

83
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.160
And the name slot comes in at 180 by default.

84
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.040
I'm just going to rename that at the top here.

85
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.080
Just name slot and then I'll compile and save.

86
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.560
And then we can jump into our graph, which is on the top right here to start adding some

87
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.760
kind of functionality.

88
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.600
So we'll go to the graph.

89
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.860
And we've got the event pre construct, which is what we want to use at the moment.

90
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.420
So we want a few variables on the left hand side to add before we get into any kind of

91
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.540
functionality.

92
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.880
So we want to actually find our text block and make sure that our text block is editable.

93
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.980
So let's go back into our designer.

94
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.340
Let's get this text block here, select the text block, and then just say is variable.

95
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.260
We can take that up there, compile and save.

96
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.060
And we'll go back into our graph.

97
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.980
And you can now see that that text block is there.

98
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.420
So we can also rename that.

99
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.100
You don't need to do this, but I just want to make sure that the text block just nice

100
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.660
clean naming conventions, compile and save, go back there.

101
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.900
And so everything looks a little bit more organized.

102
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.300
And then we just want to create a new variable as well.

103
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.540
Something along the lines of display text.

104
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.660
And we'll create a named variable from this.

105
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.180
So we'll change it from Boolean to will it be a text?

106
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.440
I believe it might be a text variable.

107
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.960
So we'll just compile and save that.

108
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.840
And then we'll drag out the display text.

109
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.160
I'm going to hold down control on my keyboard and drag out alternatively, you can just left

110
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160
mouse drag out.

111
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.520
But then it'll say do you want to get or set the variable by holding down control, you

112
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.040
will get the variable.

113
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.040
And by holding down alt, you will set the variable.

114
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.080
So that's just a little shortcut in case you want to use that there.

115
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.360
I'll compile and save.

116
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.840
And then we want to set the text.

117
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.240
So I'm just going to move these two events, we don't really need them at the moment.

118
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.800
I'm going to grab the text block.

119
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.600
So I'm going to hold down control again and drag that out.

120
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:40.480
And I'll drag off the blue pin of the text block and just say set text.

121
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.760
So select set text there.

122
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.380
And then we'll have the text there.

123
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.960
And that'll be plugged in like that.

124
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.280
So we're under pre construct, we've got some display text, and you want the text block

125
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.680
to set the text.

126
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.340
Now it's not going to set any text because we don't have any default information.

127
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.840
So we'll just type test there, compile and save.

128
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.560
And so that's our basic setup for making sure we have editable content.

129
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.600
And the last thing we want to do is just make sure that variable is public, so that that

130
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.040
is instance editable.

131
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.020
And then we'll compile and save.

132
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.920
And then before we move on, let's just make sure we can display the content on our screen.

133
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.880
So we'll go to the display map and we need to create a new game mode.

134
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.680
So we'll right click and go to blueprint class.

135
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.680
And we'll select game mode base from here.

136
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:46.520
And we'll just call that display game mode.

137
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.620
And then open that up.

138
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.380
And we just want to make sure the player controller is assigned correctly.

139
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.160
So the player controller is our display controller.

140
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.960
And we'll compile and save that.

141
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.680
We'll go to our default map, we'll make sure on the world settings, if you don't have world

142
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.040
settings open, you can make sure that the windows open on world settings, and just make

143
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.020
sure that display game mode is set there.

144
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.400
And then we'll save all.

145
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.200
I'm going to full screen my window by pressing F11 and go and hit alt and P on the keyboard.

146
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.560
And you'll see that our test is now visible on the top left hand side there.

147
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:33.440
So you'll throughout this process, we've kind of created a new game mode that will display,

148
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.100
well, use some kind of controller that takes input in the controller.

149
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:48.140
We've added the UMG to the screen via this blueprint scripting here.

150
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.020
And then the controller says load this HUD and add it to the screen.

151
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.340
And the HUD that we've created, which we can find by searching here is this UMG HUD.

152
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.300
And the UMG HUD basically says, get some text and display text.

153
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.500
So whatever's in this variable right now, if I change this to hello, and compile and

154
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:17.660
save, then if I full screen and press alt P on the keyboard, you can see hello there.

155
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.060
So we've got some really nice basic functionality of a UMG setup.

156
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.580
We know that everything's working correctly before we move on.

157
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.340
So let's jump into the next section.

158
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.900
Next we'll create a right panel widget using a sub menu, which will house a lot of interactive

159
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.020
functionality that we can add to our scene.

160
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.140
So let's jump into the editor again.

161
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.340
And so we're back in editor now, we've got our HUD UMG class open.

162
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.540
Now that we know this is working, I'm going to change custom back to fill screen, because

163
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:54.220
that's going to be the desired behavior we want as we start adding more panels to our

164
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.620
user interface.

165
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.980
So we want to start by creating this right hand panel.

166
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.960
So we want a size box.

167
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.220
So we'll type in size on the top left hand side, grab a size box and get a size box at

168
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.220
the bottom here.

169
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.900
I will add it outside this vertical box actually, size box, and we'll call this size box, the

170
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.340
right panel, for example.

171
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:24.380
So we'll just call this right panel size box.

172
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.500
So we know exactly what that is.

173
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.900
We want a grid panel view.

174
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:36.860
So we want to get the grid and we want a grid panel view on this section here.

175
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.740
So we want to child the grid panel, make sure that's underneath the size box there, and

176
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.460
just compile and save.

177
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:52.740
And we'll get this grid size box and just bring it over into some better real estate

178
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.940
there.

179
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.940
For example, there, you can even anchor it to the right right hand side there instead

180
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.900
of the left, if you wanted to make sure it's right aligned.

181
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:07.360
And so in this panel, we want to add three buttons.

182
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.020
So we want an open and close button and a tab button.

183
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.200
So we will add the open button first.

184
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.740
So we'll go to button, add the button here, and that can go under the grid panel.

185
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.520
And then we'll call, we'll just keep, because we're adding so many components at the same

186
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.120
time, we'll just keep all our naming consistent.

187
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:39.840
So we want open, close, button, and then we will add another button as well.

188
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:47.080
And this one will be called tab 01 button.

189
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.280
And then we'll add some text to, oh, I changed the open, close button text in there.

190
00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:00.080
So let's rename that open, close button and selecting this button here.

191
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.080
And we'll call this tab 01 button.

192
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.380
And then we want some text under this tab button.

193
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.720
So we'll add the text similar to how we did last time.

194
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.760
And we've got the text block there.

195
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.880
And this text will be the audio text box.

196
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.880
So we'll just say audio here.

197
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.240
And then we want another tab button.

198
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.280
So I'm just going to duplicate this by right clicking duplicate, and that'll bring the

199
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.600
button with it as well.

200
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.680
So this will be tab 02 button.

201
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.440
And then keep that renamed.

202
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:45.200
And then this one, instead of audio, will be radio.

203
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.640
If I can spell radio, there we go.

204
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.760
And then I'll just make sure in the audio text book, I've got audio.

205
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.720
So it says audio.

206
00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.160
And then I will call this text radio.

207
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160
There we go.

208
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.360
We'll compile and save and then start formatting everything now.

209
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.440
So to begin with, we want to sort out our grid panel here.

210
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.040
And we want to add the properties to the fill rule.

211
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.200
So let's add a column fill.

212
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.400
Let's add three indexes here.

213
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:32.400
And you want to input one, one, and leave index zero as zero.

214
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.140
And then on the row, we want zero.

215
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.940
And then we want a one on the one integer and zero there.

216
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.380
And then we will compile and save.

217
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.640
And then we just want to make sure our buttons are aligned correctly.

218
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.940
So the open close button will click the downward arrow there.

219
00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.720
On audio, we will click that button there.

220
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.140
And then on our radio will go one, two.

221
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.860
And so we've got our button functionality as well.

222
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:22.640
So we can add spacing as well and padding where needed if you want to on the options.

223
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:29.440
We can do that by just typing padding and then answering some kind of numerical value.

224
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:37.960
If it's 10 or 20 or whatever that padding might be, maybe 20 looks good there.

225
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.640
We'll just give it its own spacing.

226
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.640
Something like that.

227
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.420
Again, as soon as we start getting down to the visual level, it's up to you how you want

228
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.680
to format things.

229
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.100
But that'll be our basic layout.

230
00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:01.660
And then the last option that we want, the last palette option is a widget switcher.

231
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:07.420
So we just want to drag and drop the widget switcher down here and just remove that and

232
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.240
make sure the widget switcher is called widget switcher.

233
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.720
And we'll compile and save that.

234
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.840
And then we will drop down the slot and the grid slot.

235
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:28.700
And under the row variable, we want to change row to one and the column to one and the column

236
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.160
span to two.

237
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160
There we go.

238
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.640
And then compile and save again.

239
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.180
And that's our basic right panel setup.

240
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.500
So we'll move into scripting the functionality next.

241
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:49.900
So into our graph, we will find some spare real estate and we want to select the tab

242
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.860
01 button here.

243
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.420
And as soon as you select that, you'll see an on clicked event.

244
00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.860
So we'll just add the on clicked event and we will find the widget switcher, hold down

245
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:10.400
Ctrl and drag to get the variable and we'll type set active widget index.

246
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.800
And we'll hook that into there.

247
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.720
And then we'll also find tab 02 button on clicked.

248
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.320
And then the exact same thing.

249
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.080
So we'll copy and paste that.

250
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:28.220
So I've just Ctrl C, Ctrl V the function there, and we'll change this index to one.

251
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:35.780
And that'll set up some basic activity with the widget switcher on how to select each

252
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.780
one.

253
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.060
Next, we will go back into our designer.

254
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:50.820
And under our widget switcher, we will get a vertical, vertical, get a vertical box.

255
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.460
We've got that there.

256
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.040
And we will get a horizontal box as well.

257
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040
Horizontal box.

258
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.360
And we're going to start building out a volume widget here.

259
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.720
So we will get the vertical box, this will be the audio tab.

260
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.160
So we want some kind of text input combo, which will be volume.

261
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:28.060
So text, vertical, we'll call this volume.

262
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.620
Let's just select the text box volume.

263
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.580
And we could even center this up.

264
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.420
I could even add some padding if you wanted.

265
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.120
I won't start getting deep into the visual style at the moment.

266
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:52.540
So we got our text box, text says volume, and then we want a spin, spin box as well

267
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.680
adding to the vertical box.

268
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.460
And that'll be this here.

269
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:08.220
So we want to make sure on this that there is some numerical value in there.

270
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.200
We also want to set some kind of properties as well.

271
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.220
So we want to make sure that the slider has the options set.

272
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.180
So we'll scroll down here to slider.

273
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:27.080
And the min property here is going to be zero.

274
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.420
So just make sure that that's at zero.

275
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:36.980
The max is going to be zero.

276
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.260
We could actually go to zero to 11 there actually.

277
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.740
And then always use Delta snap.

278
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:48.860
We can enable, we can make sure the Delta is at one there.

279
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.140
Slider exponent is also okay there.

280
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.340
And there should be, is the slider enabled?

281
00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.020
Let's just check.

282
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.780
Yeah, so is enabled.

283
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.780
That's okay.

284
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.620
We've got the basic functionality in the slider set there.

285
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:14.860
And I might just add some padding to this just to give it a bit more space in there.

286
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.300
So again, just compile and save.

287
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.460
Next we will add another text box.

288
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.020
So add text below in this here.

289
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.780
Again we'll center it up.

290
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.820
We'll just make sure everything's aligned correctly.

291
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.940
And we'll call this text.

292
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.700
Let's find the text option.

293
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.980
And we'll call this balance.

294
00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:48.460
And we could even just start naming these text blocks as well.

295
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.260
So we know exactly what each of the text blocks are, just in case we need to reference them

296
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.260
in blueprint.

297
00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.780
That is purely just naming convention, so it's not going to affect any functionality.

298
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.820
So you can name them whatever you'd like.

299
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.980
And then we want a slider now for balance.

300
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.420
So we'll add a slider onto the vertical box.

301
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:24.420
And the slider is going to have these values of, so value is 0.5 here.

302
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.580
And the thumb image size is going to be 60.

303
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.980
Let's make sure we get the correct options here.

304
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.780
So we can type in thumb image.

305
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.620
And this will be the normal thumb image.

306
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:51.180
So from 8 and 14, we just want to change to 60 on both inputs there.

307
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.980
So 60 and 60.

308
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.380
And then if we cancel that out, the last thing we want is the thickness.

309
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.980
So again, I'll just type this property, the bar thickness.

310
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.980
I'll just change that to 1.

311
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.980
Oh, 10.

312
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.980
There we go.

313
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.100
That'll look better.

314
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.580
And then you can compile and save.

315
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.460
So we've got some basic UMG layouts for the volume and balance here.

316
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.420
Now let's switch to our horizontal box that we added before.

317
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.100
So we can either just select this and all of the other information will disappear just

318
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.020
because we've gone from the vertical box to the horizontal box.

319
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.780
So don't worry if anything disappears.

320
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.860
It's because we've got the horizontal box there.

321
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.820
Alternatively, just to show that the widget switcher is working as intended, you can actually

322
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.740
change the active widget index from 0.

323
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.460
If I can just select 0 to 1 and it'll go from 0 to 1, which is exactly what we did

324
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.500
in the graph here.

325
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.860
So it's just toggling between two different options, which is a really nice functionality.

326
00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.020
So we've got our horizontal box.

327
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.860
And again, we want to create a couple of options here.

328
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.140
So we want two different text inputs.

329
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.540
We want saved and we want the station slider here.

330
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:19.780
So on the horizontal box, we will go to a text input and we'll drag the horizontal box

331
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:26.600
here and this one will be called saved in the text.

332
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.800
So we'll just select the text box there and we'll type saved.

333
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.660
So we've got that there.

334
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.700
And then we will make sure we have a named slot.

335
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:44.940
So named slots underneath here.

336
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:52.340
And that name slot can actually go underneath the text in this instance.

337
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:59.840
And we will, so to get the name slot underneath there, we'll need a vertical box.

338
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.380
So add the vertical box under the horizontal box, and then we'll add the text under the

339
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.820
vertical and the named under there.

340
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.020
And so that will get them to stack OK.

341
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.580
And then we want the combo box adding.

342
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:21.660
So combo box, which is the string version, and that will just go under the named slot

343
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.100
there.

344
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.820
So that'll be our basic vertical box functionality.

345
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:33.860
And so then we will add the exact same, but call this a station.

346
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:43.180
So we can maybe even right click, duplicate the vertical box here, and then we'll change

347
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.260
this text to station instead of saved.

348
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.060
So station will be there.

349
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.520
And we don't actually need the combo box this time.

350
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.740
So we can delete that one.

351
00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:03.300
I'll rename this name slot to maybe let's call it station named slot.

352
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.780
And you don't need to rename your content.

353
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:11.500
It's more just to keep organized as this list ever expands.

354
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.820
It's good to keep things organized.

355
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.500
So I'll call this, this other one station named slot.

356
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.300
There we go.

357
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.780
So we can see exactly what we're doing.

358
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:29.140
And then on the second vertical, we'll call this vertical, we'll rename it, let's say

359
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.060
text input combo.

360
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.060
And this will be the station one.

361
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:48.660
And then this one will rename text input combo.

362
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.580
And this will be the saved one.

363
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.300
So this helps keep things a little bit more organized.

364
00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.580
And then on the second text input combo, which is the station, we just now want to

365
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.860
add a slider.

366
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:12.980
So we will go to the top, we will add a slider, and we will add this to here.

367
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.900
And we can actually change this version of the slider.

368
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:23.820
If we type in orientation, we can actually change this to vertical, which will look much

369
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.620
better.

370
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:35.060
So the values for this one will be, let's see on the slider, we've got the value, let's

371
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.380
call this 80.

372
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.700
Let's say the min value is 80.

373
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:48.140
And the max value in this instance will be 110.

374
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.460
We've already changed the orientation.

375
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.340
Let's change the step size.

376
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.740
And we'll call this point one instead of point zero one.

377
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:04.420
We'll change the thumb size again.

378
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:11.540
And we will call this one, maybe 40 by 100.

379
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.140
And again, changing that bar thickness as we did last time as well.

380
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.660
We'll change this one to 10.

381
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.180
So that's our basic styling done.

382
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.060
And we now want to make sure this gets resized correctly.

383
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.820
So let's maybe move this down here.

384
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.900
And then maybe let's just try and fill this out here.

385
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.340
So that will look much better.

386
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.840
We could even change the horizontal.

387
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.400
So we can change all the padding, things like this.

388
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.360
So maybe let's try value of 20 again.

389
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.320
And then maybe on each individual padding as well, we just pad this out a little bit

390
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320
more.

391
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.060
Again, we're working with a lot of different properties.

392
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:07.160
So you can kind of balance this to however you want it to look.

393
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.160
And then this slider, this slider, let's just check the value here.

394
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.720
That thumb, that thumb size doesn't feel right.

395
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.740
So let's just check the thumb.

396
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.700
So normal thumb image size.

397
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.660
Let's see, let's try 40 and 100.

398
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.980
There we go.

399
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.960
That's made it look much better.

400
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:44.220
So yeah, that value can then be set to 80 and we're okay to move on.

401
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.760
So compile and save and we'll move on to the next section.

402
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.500
So let's move into some visual scripting now.

403
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.740
So we'll go back to our graph.

404
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.840
And this time we want the station slider.

405
00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.700
So the slider that we've got is our station slider, which again, we didn't rename.

406
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.680
So let's go in there and rename it so we can keep track of everything.

407
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:10.620
So this slider 260 is our station slider, but let's make sure that's named correctly

408
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.040
so we know exactly where it is.

409
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.520
We'll compile and save, jump back into the graph.

410
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.360
And now we've got the slider station here.

411
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.940
So we actually want the, you've got a few different options, but we actually want the

412
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.820
value changed option on the bottom here.

413
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.140
So we'll just click on value changed.

414
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.500
And then we just want to create a new custom event.

415
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:43.160
So just right click custom event and we'll call this update station text.

416
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.800
And we will actually then compile and save on the value changed.

417
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.000
And this will just keep things modular.

418
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.720
We will update the station text.

419
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.820
So we'll click up, enter there and whatever we named this custom event, that's what this

420
00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.820
is calling.

421
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.880
So if we double click this, you'll see that we go to this section here, which is really

422
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880
nice functionality.

423
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:15.480
And we can actually add a new pin into the value by, I used to be able to drag that.

424
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:25.200
I'm pretty sure, but anyway, we'll add a new input here and we'll call this just value.

425
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.540
There we go.

426
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.960
Change this to a float.

427
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.940
So now we've got a value value.

428
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.160
You'll see that this box is updated here and we can just drag and drop that in there.

429
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.980
So whatever value the slider feeds into this event, we'll get this output here.

430
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.620
This is what we were talking about when we were referring to working in a modular way.

431
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:52.140
So you can have this functionality over here, which feeds out to this functionality here.

432
00:30:52.140 --> 00:31:00.800
So now we just want to update the text on the combo station based on whatever value

433
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.460
is being fed into here.

434
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.960
So we need to make sure we've got the correct text assigned.

435
00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:12.800
And again, going back to good naming, we want to make sure that the text input combo there,

436
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.760
that station, we want to change that to get the text box here.

437
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.780
So the text is station.

438
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:29.520
Want to make sure that is a variable and we'll call this station text, compile and save.

439
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.800
So we're looking for a station text.

440
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.880
So we've got station text here.

441
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:40.640
We'll grab this and then we'll do a set text as we did before.

442
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.840
We've got a set text.

443
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.680
There we go.

444
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:54.920
We want to get this value and do a to text, which is in brackets, the flow.

445
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.960
So we have a few different properties down here that we can edit.

446
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.360
We'll just move this into position.

447
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.880
We'll drag this into here.

448
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.320
The use grouping, all these values are okay.

449
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:17.800
The min max digits can be two and three.

450
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.400
And the min max fractional digits are both one each.

451
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.720
There we go.

452
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.120
We'll just compile and save that.

453
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.560
Next we will edit the saved station.

454
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:39.320
So we'll go back into the designer and the combo box here, which is the saved.

455
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.600
We have this combo box that we can select.

456
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:53.520
And so we want to make sure that the default option, we'll just type in non here and set

457
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.720
non to the selected option.

458
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:05.880
And then content pattern, that should be okay as is.

459
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.440
We want to make sure that the down arrow is false.

460
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.760
So has down arrow is false.

461
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.200
And then item style, the text color is white.

462
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.760
So item style.

463
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.200
And we want to find the text color, make that white.

464
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.600
There we go.

465
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:38.800
And then the font, the size can be 20 in this instance.

466
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.160
And an outline can be two.

467
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.640
So let's see, outline size is two.

468
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.960
And you can also of course add a button padding if you want to.

469
00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.440
And I've just compiled and saved this and noticed that the text isn't the correct color.

470
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.920
So let's just make sure we fix that before moving on.

471
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.200
So you can actually, I think maybe change the foreground color.

472
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:15.340
Yeah, let's just change that foreground color to a white and then non should be correct.

473
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.200
So you should end up with something like this.

474
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.680
If I go back down to the horizontal box, I'll actually maybe just try and collapse some of this here

475
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.720
so we can see a little bit better.

476
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.760
But that should be overall what we're looking at for that section.

477
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.240
Next, we want to create a list of saved stations.

478
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:41.360
So we'll go back into our graph here and we'll create a new variable, which is a saved station list.

479
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:57.040
So let's say saved station list and the variable type will be a string to float.

480
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.680
Let's just add a string.

481
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.080
Let's change that to an array, a map.

482
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.160
And then so yeah, string and then to map.

483
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.880
And then we want the actual flow here.

484
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.680
There we go.

485
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.280
And then we can compile and save that.

486
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:26.640
And as we're adding variables, sometimes it's easier to just separate these out into maybe call it the setting config,

487
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.640
the category config or something like this.

488
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.040
And then if you do the display text and change that to config,

489
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.360
it'll create its own group of variables that you edit.

490
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:45.160
So sometimes if you've got a whole list of variables here, it can just be a little bit easier to keep everything organized there.

491
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.840
So just worth keeping in mind.

492
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.680
The pre-construct, we'll just delete this now because this was just a test.

493
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.520
So I won't do that.

494
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.440
I'll compile and save.

495
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.600
And then now we want to get this saved station list.

496
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.120
And then we want to get the keys from this.

497
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.600
So we'll type keys.

498
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.360
We'll add this to the execution line.

499
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.200
There we go.

500
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.200
And then we'll for each from this array.

501
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.440
So let's for each loop through this series of keys here.

502
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:29.440
So we'll just loop through the whole station list and to try and find a certain variable.

503
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.560
So from the array, we'll do add option.

504
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.680
Well, from the actual station list, sorry, which is the combo box that we added before.

505
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:47.360
So let's just make sure we have combo.

506
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.360
So we've called that combo box string.

507
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.040
So let's rename that combo.

508
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.080
Again, this is why naming convention is good.

509
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.800
So combo box save station.

510
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.280
Let's go back to our graph now.

511
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.120
Let's go back into here.

512
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.000
Drag this out, holding down control.

513
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.720
And then we'll add the option from here.

514
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.200
Add option array element into there.

515
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.640
So that's our pre-construct.

516
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.040
So we can compile and save.

517
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.360
And then we want on the combo saved stations.

518
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.320
We actually want to change this property.

519
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.920
So let's start commenting out our code so we know exactly what we're doing.

520
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.960
So you can actually select a few boxes and you can just say like pre-construct and press

521
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.960
C on the keyboard.

522
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.600
Add that comment box and you can actually change the color if you want.

523
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:52.040
If you're looking at any kind of execution wiring or anything like this, you can go to

524
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.680
town on the font size, all this kind of stuff.

525
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.680
So I just I'm going to keep things organized.

526
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.480
Pressing C on my keyboard again.

527
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.280
Widget switcher is there.

528
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.920
Slider station.

529
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.920
This is purely for organization.

530
00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.520
So it's completely up to you if you decide to do this.

531
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.720
But it just helps see things at a higher level, exactly what's going on,

532
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.840
especially when you've got a lot of blueprint being coded.

533
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.640
So I'm just going to compile and save that.

534
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:36.600
So from this combo box saved stations now, we will see the on selection changed here.

535
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:44.760
So let's add this as a property here and we'll go get the saved station list from here.

536
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.640
And we will drag off and type find.

537
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.920
The selected item we will add into here.

538
00:38:52.920 --> 00:39:00.760
We will look for a specific value and then the slider station text, which is in the designer.

539
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.480
So the slider station text, which is this, we'll go back into our graph.

540
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.800
So that's the station text that we've got selected.

541
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.760
Now we want to set a value here.

542
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.000
Set.

543
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.480
That's not the text that we want, is it?

544
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.920
It's the actual slider.

545
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.080
So let's grab the slider.

546
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.720
There we go.

547
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.200
Slider.

548
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.440
Station.

549
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.040
Let's grab the slider.

550
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.160
That's what we want to do.

551
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.280
Set value and drag that into there.

552
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.440
And then the value can get passed out into there.

553
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.680
And now, now we want to update the station text.

554
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.960
So go back to our designer, we'll get our station text, go back into our graph.

555
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.680
And then we will check that out there.

556
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:56.600
And actually we have a update station text function already created.

557
00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:02.200
So let's just call that update station text because now we're reusing functionality.

558
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.800
So we'll type update station text and you'll see that option there.

559
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.200
And you just want to make sure whatever you called this event that we created before,

560
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.960
you can just call that here and we can just drag out from the find and add that in there.

561
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.000
If you want to clean things up, you can double click and create

562
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.160
re-root nodes on the actual line.

563
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.280
And I can hold down alt on my keyboard and drag that in there.

564
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.640
If you just want to make things a little bit cleaner, I'm just going to compile and save

565
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.720
and we can move on to the next section.

566
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.960
And then lastly, it'd be useful to show you some animation functionality if you want to add this

567
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.000
for yourself.

568
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.680
So we can actually go back into the designer and you'll see I've got an animation window

569
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.880
open at the bottom here.

570
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.280
If you don't have that open, you can just go to window, animations,

571
00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.000
and this animation box will appear for you.

572
00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:03.800
And I'll just select the right panel size box and we will add an animation

573
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.400
and we will just call this a close open panel.

574
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.720
And if we select that now, we can add a track.

575
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.600
So we want to make sure we have the right panel size box here.

576
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.720
We will go to track, add rights panel size box.

577
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.720
And we can now add a transform.

578
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:36.920
So we'll go to track and we will add a transform and we can actually drop down this transform here.

579
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.560
And we don't actually care about any of the other properties here.

580
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.520
We mostly care about the translation.

581
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.760
So I'm going to right click and delete the rotation.

582
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.520
I'm going to delete the scale.

583
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.800
I'm going to delete the shear.

584
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.440
I just care about the translation.

585
00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:00.280
I actually only really care about the translation in X because I want to move from left to right.

586
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.600
So I'm going to drag out maybe however many seconds you want the animation to go over.

587
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.520
I'm just going to drag to maybe three seconds.

588
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:15.320
I'm going to add an X key there and then I'm going to go back over to here

589
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:24.840
and I want to change this translation maybe to maybe to 843.

590
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.000
For example, I'm just scrolling across here.

591
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.920
And now when I press play, you'll see that this slides into view over three seconds.

592
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.240
So again, this is a very rudimentary kind of animation.

593
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.400
I'm sure you could create something much nicer with giving a bit more time.

594
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:49.720
And I just want to show you some basic animation inside of UMG if you wanted to add that.

595
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.000
So to actually add that functionality.

596
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.760
So we've got the animation here, but it's not actually part of the project.

597
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.960
So if we want to add that into the project, we can go back into our graph

598
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.480
and we can find some empty space and the open close button that we created at the very start.

599
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.840
We can just go to the on clicks of the open close button

600
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.200
and we can get the close open animation.

601
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.240
So we can make sure that we find the animation.

602
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.960
Let's just make sure it's a variable.

603
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:34.200
So let me just go to the graph, open, close panel.

604
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:36.920
There we go.

605
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.440
Just make sure it's called that.

606
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.280
So close open panel.

607
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.080
So I'll just right click close open panel and then I can play that animation.

608
00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.880
So actually I want to play the animation forward in this instance.

609
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.560
So play animation forward.

610
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.800
I'll just delete that.

611
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.000
And there we go.

612
00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.120
And then we can actually just play that animation in reverse as well.

613
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.440
Now, every time we click this button, we want it to do the opposite of what it just did.

614
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.720
So I can drag out from the execution pin.

615
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.400
I can flip flop here, add that flip flop in there, and actually just drag that into that.

616
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.240
So every time I click the button, it'll play the animation.

617
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:25.800
And every time I click it again, it'll reverse that animation.

618
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.240
So keep flip flop in between, play in reverse, play in reverse.

619
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.800
And therefore that will add the desired functionality that we want.

620
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.040
So now let's make sure this all works in situ.

621
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.520
So I'm going to go back to my designer.

622
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.920
I'm going to find this first key.

623
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.640
I'll make sure that the first key is this little button here

624
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.520
because that's going to open the actual animation.

625
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.760
So we'll see that that will open on the side.

626
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.760
I can delete this text for now.

627
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.880
That was just example.

628
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.240
So we'll compile and save.

629
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.040
So this is everything that we've seen so far.

630
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.040
Because we've got our controller, we're adding the UMG to the screen.

631
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.440
So that's already added.

632
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.040
So let's go back into our map.

633
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.240
Let's just make sure everything is saved before we try this out.

634
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.280
We'll go to full screen hitting F11.

635
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.240
I'm going to press Alt and P on my keyboard.

636
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.840
Now it's out by default, but let's just check that this is working.

637
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.760
So we can actually change that first key.

638
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:35.000
But you'll see that this opens and closes, reversing and opening.

639
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.240
So that's really nice functionality.

640
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.000
And we have the different audio and radio stations

641
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.520
and we can update these based on those properties.

642
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:50.120
So hopefully that gives you a good overview of the UMG

643
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.400
and different functionalities we can add inside of our interfaces.

644
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.240
If we had our test map open, then we'd be able to see our car

645
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.320
in the background and have all that, the functionality

646
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.400
required for that car configurator opening and closing.

647
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.640
So hopefully you found that useful and we'll jump into the closing comments.
