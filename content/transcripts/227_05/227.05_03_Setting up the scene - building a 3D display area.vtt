00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
And then let's quickly go over the scene setup for the demo today so that you can get a rough

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.680
representation of what we're working with today. So we want to display the vehicle blueprint,

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.160
which is an actor here, and the actor will take in data from the UI. We'll use the data to update

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.120
the 3d model in some way. And also we can also hold a 3d widget component. So if you see this

5
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.760
components box at the top left hand side here, you can see an add button, you can actually add

6
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.280
widgets to this blueprint, which is really powerful functionality. Here's the vehicle blueprint

7
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.800
component. And then also we have our scene setup. So we just have this blank level, we've got a

8
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.920
camera actor. And if you go into the camera actor properties, you want to make sure auto activate

9
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280
for player is player zero. And this means that we can possess this camera like we were talking

10
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.760
about before with our controller, we can take input when we actually want to play this experience.

11
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520
We have a rec light setup, you can use a point light as well. They're both set to stationary.

12
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.680
We want the vehicle in there. And then we've just created a cube, which is the mesh floor,

13
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.160
and just stretched out there. So that's the basic scene setup that we'll be working with today.
