00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540
Let's cover some UMG fundamentals first and how to set up your interface in the scene

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.780
that we'll be looking at today.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.080
So to get started, we can open a blank template and we can create an empty level to begin

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080
a project.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
And then what we can actually do is add a feature or content pack into the existing

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.600
blank project so that we can just include some specific content for what we need today.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.160
So we're going to include the vehicle template asset and we'll just click add to project

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.480
and this will give us access to this car model that you can see in the scene there.

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.960
So it's a nice clean way to work.

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.400
You don't have to come with all the bulk of other information from other content packs.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.080
So go ahead and do that, save all and we're good to get started.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.280
We'll be using the game mode today to store information and so I think it'd be useful

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.660
to cover what a game mode is and especially in relation to HMI.

14
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.440
So the game mode first of all is singleton so it can be accessed by any class, meaning

15
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.240
that whenever you have a session active, you can find the game mode based on any class

16
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.560
that's currently in that scene.

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.840
It holds data so you can easily access and store data inside the game mode.

18
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
And the cool thing about this is that it only exists as long as the level is open.

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.520
So we use the game instance and also save states for long term data storage.

20
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.880
So if you just want to access information during the actual session, then you can have

21
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.840
whatever variables or information you want to store inside the game mode and that will

22
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840
be fine.

23
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.680
It's like a one shot use of data.

24
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.000
If we're wanting to maybe change the color of a car and actually save that information,

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.840
you wouldn't want to do that on the game mode.

26
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.760
You'd want to do it either in the game instance or in a save state.

27
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.560
So it's worth highlighting the differences there.

28
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.300
When we talk about controller in this instance in HMI, we're talking about something that

29
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.200
we can possess.

30
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.120
So we will when we load the session and play the session, controller will become active

31
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.240
and we can interact with this scene with our controller.

32
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.160
So for our purposes today, our controller will be our camera manager.

33
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.480
So it's a digital representation of a user and we possess it like a pawn in a scene.

34
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.920
It can have input assigned to it.

35
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.400
So we can bind either keyboard and mouse events or any other peripheral that you have plugged

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400
in.

37
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.260
We can actually take input into the controller.

38
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.480
So it allows for a lot of flexibility there as well.

39
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.400
And as you can see in a HMI, the controller can be used to change the interaction modes

40
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520
and manage the information as well.

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.080
So a lot of power in the controller and that is what we'll be using today to interact with

42
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
that scene.

43
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.600
A pawn on the other hand is a representation of generally your avatar in the world.

44
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.920
So it's the user's visual or digital form.

45
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.480
It's a CDO Singleton, but the HMI is like any visible pawn.

46
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.280
So we just possess a camera to see the visual elements and there's no visual element needed

47
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.080
because we don't need to move or manipulate anything.

48
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.180
And then in a standard HMI game mode, the pawn class is set to none.

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.960
So in that screen that we saw here, when we have a pawn class, we won't need any kind

50
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.400
of pawn class assigned because the controller will be handling everything in this instance.

51
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.160
And then looking at some default properties for our project settings, we want to go to

52
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.960
the edit button at the top of our Unreal Engine window and go down to project settings, which

53
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.800
you'll find towards the bottom.

54
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.600
And you can go to the maps and mode sections and we just want to change some of these properties.

55
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.240
So if you can't find any of these properties, there's a search bar at the top of project

56
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.160
settings, which you can easily find any of these parameters here.

57
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
But we want to change the game mode up here.

58
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.760
We want to change the default map to whatever map we want to load at the start and we want

59
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.420
to change the game instance.

60
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.800
So whatever you call your map, if you go to file, save as, and you call your map something,

61
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.060
for example, display map in this instance, you just want to make sure that that's assigned.

62
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.460
In case we package up the game or the executable and we want to share this with someone else,

63
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.500
that will load the correct map by default.

64
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.340
So it's worth keeping those settings in mind.

65
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.780
And today we'll be displaying some kind of data on the screen that we want to interact

66
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.340
with and we use UMG for this, which stands for Unreal Motion Graphics.

67
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.340
And they're the properties that you can see on the right hand side here.

68
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.240
And we can design those, which we'll jump into in just a few moments.

69
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.340
So what is this display of data?

70
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.160
So it's a collapse UI.

71
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.480
We have widgets as templates, so you can create a widget and assign it to various different

72
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.360
interactive elements throughout this HMI demo.

73
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.620
We have widget switches, which are contextual menu changes.

74
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.240
So we can switch from one menu to another menu.

75
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.400
We have widget layering.

76
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.640
We have text displays, as you can see on the right there, where you can format your text,

77
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040
however you'd like it.

78
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.720
And we can actually bind events to the input of clicking any of these buttons.

79
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.240
So if we click this audio button, we can fire off some kind of logic, which will cause a

80
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.880
state change in this demo, which will be really powerful moving forward.
