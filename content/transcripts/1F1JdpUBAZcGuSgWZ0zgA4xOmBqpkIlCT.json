  "text": " Now the next thing we could take a look at is how to spawn these controls using the controlStackAtItem function instead of the spawnTransformControlNode. Now a lot of the logic is going to be the same, but it'll be slightly simplified. And we'll take a look at some of the settings that make it different from the spawnControlNode. Now if I just change this back to our ManiSimpleMesh, we're going to use the same basic principles. So we're going to find all of the bones, and we're going to create their hierarchy based on the parent's name. But something like the transform is going to be set automatically based on the bone information, so we don't have to find this transform information anymore. So let's take a quick look. So I'm going to just alt-click to disconnect that current flow of logic and just bring this down here. And we'll just essentially recreate a handful of this. So if we search for itemNameSearch, again we'll leave that partial name as none and search for all of the bones. And then search for a forEach. And we'll grab the controlStackAtItem function here. Connect those up. Connect up the element to the item. And you can see that pretty quickly we have all of the controls created, and they're not yet in their own hierarchy, but they're outside of the skeleton's hierarchy. So in order to correct this hierarchy, we need to just find the parents again in the same way that we did here. So we need to get the parent of the element. And out of the name, we want to add underscore control. Now we know we want to add underscore control because in the controlStackAtItem control suffix, that says underscore control there by default. If you change this to be anything else, you would also need to update this here. But if you pop open the parent pin and connect up the result and the name pin together, and remember to change the type to control, you'll see that, oh, if we just compile that, you'll see that all of our controls are now in the correct hierarchy. And that hierarchy is based upon your bones. So it can be a little quicker sometimes to use the controlStackAtItem function because it takes a lot of the information that it needs from the item that you're connecting in here. So it's going to name the controls based on the item you're connecting in, so you're not having to kind of do that creation yourself here. And as well as the transforms, it'll get that from the item itself. So as well as the sort of traditional settings that you have access to here with things like the limits and the shape, you can also do things like add nulls. I just compile that above each of the items that this controlStack is creating. And that just allows you to have sort of an extra level of control and build more functionality into your rig. You can also add nulls below the item that you're creating, as well as secondary controls. So you can add essentially a child control for each control that's being created here. And then each of those secondary controls has their own settings here. You can also customize the control suffix and the null suffix if you wanted to edit those. There are also a few different useful options down here where you can zero the values on the controls if you're adding a null so that you don't get any sort of extra offset values there. You can also choose to orient the controls to world, which can be useful for things like AK feet, for example. And you can also tell it to automatically tag all the controls that are being created so that, you know, that's one less bit of logic that you need to set up. So you can see how this can be quite useful because it has a lot of extra functionality built in that you wouldn't have to build the logic for. And if we wanted to finish this off just with the same sort of colorizing options, we could add our tag for bones here. I just control D this add tag. I connect the item there. There we go. And we can also colorize the controls again. And find items with tag. And search for controls here because that's the tag that we're getting given here. And there you go, automatically colorized once again. Now, whilst we've created an incredibly fast rig here, super fast, simple FK rig, one thing that it's not is user friendly. So as you can see at the moment, we can't really select, you know, any of the fingers with any intent other than perhaps grabbing them from the scene here, from the hierarchy here. But it's not really that super user friendly. So one thing that we'd recommend is to actually build this out in sort of segments, which I have an example of here. So what we've got here is we've built the sort of central spine here with one control stack item function. And then we've built out the arms with another and the fingers with another. So it's building off the same general nodes that we've been using. So the item name search node, in this case, we're searching for the spine. And then for each of those, we're finding the parent to sort out the hierarchy. But what we're doing is inside the settings of this node, or this function, should I say, is we're updating both the visuals of the actual control itself. So this is a hexagon thick and we're updating the scale and the rotation of it. So we're essentially customizing the look of the control sort of part of the body. Now that was for the spine. So for the spine, for both of the arms, what we've done is tag the arm bones as arm bones. And for each of those things, we're doing the same setup. We're getting the parent to create the hierarchy, and we're just updating what the shape looks like and the transforms of the shape to suit our character a bit better. And very, very similar. The only thing we're doing slightly differently with the hands is instead of using the get parent node, which we've done a few times, what we're doing here is we're getting the children of the hand bone for both the hand left and the hand R. And we're essentially stitching those two arrays together with this append node. And then other than that, we're again doing the exact same logic. So for each of those, we're finding the parent to create a hierarchy and customizing the look of the controls. And the last thing that we've done with these is to actually tag our finger bones and controls as well as our arm controls and spine controls separately so that down in the forwards logic here, we can just find all of our bones that are tagged with spine bones, arm bones and finger bones and append those arrays together to plug into the FK chain. And the same with the controls. Find all the controls, append them all together and connect them up to the FK chain. That way we get just the controls we want. And we can customize the shape and the look of each of the controls per body part. So now that we have a more functional rig, but using the exact same methods that we were using when we were creating controls for every bone in the hierarchy. And again, this can be extrapolated out if you go to your preview settings for any of your characters that you have here. In this case, we'd need to make sure that all of our bone names are the same between our characters because we're searching for things like hand bone names, spine bone names. So if we were to swap for another biped like this Bungee Man for example, we should see that it just re-rigs itself. So we have all of our spine bones here, spine control should I say, our arm controls and our finger controls here. And now you can kind of start to see the power of it where we've made this one control rig, but it's actually usable for many different characters within our one project.",
