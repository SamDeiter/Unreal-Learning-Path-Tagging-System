  "text": " It's also worth noting you can create collisions in your DCC program as long as you name them correctly in the outliner. So give the collision mesh the name of the component that you're adding collision to and then just add the prefix UCX underscore. And if you name your objects UCX underscore, when you import the FBX inside of Unreal, Unreal will know that that is a collision object. So you can see on our image on the right hand side here, we've got this large shell over the more complex geometry in this yellow zone. So we just added some basic primitive shapes around the object, which we then called UCX underscore and Unreal will detect that shell as the collision. You know, if you had imported inside of Unreal without any collision, you may have either had to do lots of complex collisions set up or if you would tick the box, generate collision, you may have ended up with more complex collision than need be. So it's good practice in my mind to set it up in your DCC program and just making sure that you know the collision is set at the root of where you created the asset. But as we mentioned, there are multiple ways to create collisions and it'll be dependent on what your preferred pipeline is there.",
