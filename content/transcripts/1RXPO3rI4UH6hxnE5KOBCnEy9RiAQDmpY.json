  "text": " While Static Mesh import via FBX works fine for individual assets, it doesn't do too well with fully constructed scenes. In fact, it doesn't do too well with assets that are based on hierarchical structure. I will explain. Look at this Cessna plane asset inside 3ds Max. It's a simple asset, but one that has been set up with a certain hierarchy in mind. The main body of the plane is a single mesh, but there are smaller parts like flaps, ailerons and rudder that were kept separate for animation purposes. These were hierarchically linked to animation helpers, essentially non-rendered null objects, which you can animate in local rotation mode to control the various components. Although this hierarchy is retained when you export the FBX file, you get unpredictable results when importing that file in Unreal. In Unreal, create a folder and name it Cessna. Go into that folder and import the file named sm-cessna-172-fbx. Reset the FBX import options to their defaults and import the file. The Content Browser shows the materials and the meshes related to that asset, but not the animation helpers. If you drag the meshes into the scene, the plane looks good, but a glance at the outliner shows that you have lost your hierarchy. This means it would be very hard to animate the various parts at this time. As you can see, using a drag-and-drop or the Import button for that matter, it doesn't help when dealing with an asset that has a hierarchy. In order to preserve that hierarchy, you need to work a bit differently. Delete the actors that make the plane and in fact, delete the assets in the Content Browser as well. To import the file and preserve the hierarchy, you need to use the option under File, Import into Level. Choose a folder to import it into, in this case the Cessna folder you created earlier. And then you are presented with a different FBX import dialog than the one you are used to. Note the Scene tab and click the Expand All button. You can see how the whole hierarchy is stored and accounted for in the FBX file, including the null objects. How the tabs show you more details about what's stored, such as the Static Meshes tab, where you have some of the same options you find in the regular FBX import dialog. For example, you can set the Normal Import to the default, and the Static Meshes to the default. You can also use the Import method to import normals and tangents, which works better with FBX files generated in 3ds Max. All the tabs cater for skeletal meshes, if any are present, or materials that you can override at import time. Let's keep it simple and stick with the Scene tab for now. Aside from the preserved hierarchy, note the drop-down option that's labeled Hierarchy Type. It defaults to an option that reads Create One Blueprint Asset. Arguably, that's the best option you can use and the one that gives you the most flexibility. It ensures all the hierarchy comes in as designed and is contained inside one actor blueprint. This makes scene management easier as you are dealing with a single actor in the scene rather than many. And being a blueprint, you can add intelligence to the actor by developing a specific code if you need it. You also want to import the models as dynamic objects if you are planning to animate them. Import the file. In the Content Browser, one of the assets is indeed a Blueprint. Open it to take a peek. The Plane components are listed in the Blueprint Editor. The hierarchy is preserved and every component is set to Movable because of that dynamic option you chose at import time. Close the Blueprint Editor and take a look at the imported plane. It is a single Blueprint actor in the Outliner but the various components still appear in the Details panel. This means you can still select the helper component, such as the one controlling the rudder or the left aileron, and rotate it locally. Ultimately, you can drag in another instance of the asset that you can control independently. This is your workflow to bring FBX hierarchies into Unreal. Another option would be to use Datasmith interoperability instead of FBX, but that discussion is for another class on another day.",
