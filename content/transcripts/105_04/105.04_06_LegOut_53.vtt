1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Continue from the last section or open the level named 04 Cinematics Render. If you need to, select and open the level sequence that is in this level.

2
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.000
Now that we have the animation sequence defined, it's time to output the results to disk.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Mainly you have two ways of doing this. One is to use Movie Render Queue or MRQ for short, and this method delivers the best outputs. We'll cover it in the next section.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.500
The other method is to use a legacy output, and as the name implies, it is older technology with less quality and fewer features, but its simplicity can be used for fast previews.

5
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.500
For still renderings or essentially screenshots, you can go to a frame you like,

6
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.500
and then use the Viewport menu to access the High Resolution Screenshot option.

7
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Here you can define a Screenshot Multiplied value, but be careful not to go overboard. If your current screen is set to HD, a 2x multiplier will give you a 4K resolution.

8
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500
In general, try to restrict yourself to a maximum of 3x for a preview.

9
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.500
You have some additional features to choose from, but for now, click the Capture button to save this frame to disk.

10
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
The image is saved to the Project Saved folder, and you can open it in File Manager.

11
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:41.500
You can view its properties, and note that in my case, the resolution is set to 2432x1368. That's double the resolution seen in my current viewport.

12
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Note that the Multiplier works on the viewport resolution, and not on your Windows desktop resolution.

13
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
View the image.

14
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.500
You'll see that it has some anti-aliasing issues that you can greatly improve later in MRQ, but for a preview, it's acceptable.

15
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.500
You'll also notice that any non-renderable icons in the viewer are also saved as part of the image. After all, it's just a screen capture.

16
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.500
So you may want to hide these with the G key prior to exporting the image.

17
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.500
To render animation previews, you can use the Movie Screen Capture, and the G key to export the image.

18
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.500
You can also use the G key to export the image.

19
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500
You can also use the G key to export the image.

20
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500
You can also use the G key to export the image.

21
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:47.500
To render animation previews, you can use the Movie Screen Capture, Legacy option, from the Sequencer toolbar, and then click the Render button.

22
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.500
A dialog opens giving you various output options including AVI files.

23
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.500
You can change the frame rate,

24
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
or the resolution,

25
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
or the resolution.

26
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.500
You can also change compression quality, although you cannot change the codec. A higher compression quality results in a bigger AVI file.

27
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500
There are some additional options to choose from but none that affect the quality of the output.

28
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.500
As you click the Capture Movie button, you can save your scene and wait for the AVI output to compile.

29
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.500
You will see it render in a preview window.

30
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Once it's done, it will be saved to the Project Save folder under a dedicated Video Captures subfolder.

31
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.500
From there, you can double-click it to play it back with your assigned movie player.

32
00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:10.500
This would work fine as a quick preview to share with clients and colleagues but when it comes to creating high-quality outputs, you had better rely on Mover in the queue, which we'll learn about in the next section.

33
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500
Thank you for watching!
