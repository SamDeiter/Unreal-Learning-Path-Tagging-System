1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Continue from the last section or load the level named 04 Cinematics Render.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you need to, select and open the level sequence that is in this level.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
As you may have noticed it from the last section, Movie Render Queue is accessible from Sequencer,

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but it is also available in the Windows menu under Cinematics.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If these options are not present when using a different project, make sure you visit the Plugins dialog,

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and ensure Movie Render Queue is active.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The Additional Render Passes option is currently in beta and is used to create mats, which is not needed for this project even though the plugin is enabled.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When you start Movie Render Queue from the Windows menu, it starts with a blank job list.

9
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But if you start it from within Sequencer, it picks up the level sequence you have already defined, in this case Sequencer Render.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Otherwise, you can add the sequence using the Render button, thus creating a batch render job.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If you expand the job entry, you'll see the three camera shots defined in the level sequence.

12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
All three are active, but you can disable one or more that you don't need to render.

13
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For this demo, I'll keep all three active, although it will take longer to render.

14
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
To adjust render parameters, you can click on Save Config. Ultimately, you'll be able to save and load your own presets.

15
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Here you can start making adjustments such as the output type, currently set to JPEG Sequence.

16
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You can opt for something better such as a PNG or EXR sequences, but JPEG will be fine for now.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can edit the parameters of the deferred rendering or add to them.

18
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is where you could add path tracing to your render queue, for example, as long as ray tracing is enabled in your project.

19
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Another option would be to add a lighting-only entry to the queue to render a sequence like the style you see in Viewport mode.

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This could potentially be used later as a multiplier layer in the compositing software.

21
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Under Output, you can set things like an output folder, resolution and frame rate, among other options.

22
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Perhaps more importantly, you can add parameters to control quality such as anti-aliasing.

23
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You can override the default anti-aliasing and increase the temporal count substantially to increase anti-aliasing quality. I'll go with a value of 32.

24
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This will increase render time significantly, but will provide higher quality renders.

25
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This number, like many numbers in UE5, should be kept to a power of 2.

26
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Another quality control settings you can add is Games Override.

27
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000
If nothing else, this option ensures Lot 0 for all meshes is active all the time, so meshes will remain in high quality display even if you're not close to them.

28
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This entry also sets shadows in high quality mode, among other options.

29
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Finally, add a Console Variables entry to the queue.

30
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This allows you to specify console variables that will affect the rendering process only, not the project itself.

31
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:07.000
For example, you can add a couple of variable entries, one for the Bloom quality by entering r.bloomQuality,

32
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and then setting its value to 5, the range being from 0 to 5.

33
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I add another for Motion Blur quality by entering r.motionBlurQuality,

34
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and setting its value to 4, this variable ranging from 0 to 4.

35
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Once you have made your adjustments, you can opt to save the preset so you can use it again at a later time.

36
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You can then accept the changes and go back to the main window.

37
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
At this time, you can elect to render locally or remote to send the job as a separate process and free your local resources.

38
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
For now, go ahead and render locally.

39
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The render will be slow but mostly because it's rendering all 32 anti-aliasing subframes of roughly a thousand frames as defined by the Playback Area and Sequencer.

40
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The estimated render time for the current camera shot is shown in the Preview window. I'll speed up the process.

41
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The Low Quality label only refers to the current Preview window and does not denote the quality of the rendered frames to disk.

42
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
As it renders the sequence, you can view the results by visiting the Output folder and viewing one of the images.

43
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You'll find out that the anti-aliasing is of far better quality than the screenshot tool gave us earlier.

44
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Once all images are saved to disk, you can compile them together into an animation by using programs like Adobe Premiere or even Photoshop.

45
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:33.000
In Photoshop, you only need to open the first image and select the Image Sequence option.

46
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Once loaded, make sure the timeline is displayed.

47
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then click the Play button to view the animation.

48
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This brings us to the end of this class. Make sure you save your work and exit the project.
