1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Make sure you have downloaded and extracted the zip file provided for this class. Open the project named Cinematics Arc if you'd like to follow along.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The project is mostly the same one that you used in the Sequencer for Architecture class and contains several saved levels.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you load the final scene, the level named 04 Cinematics Render, you see an architectural dwelling with a few characters in a plaza.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If you go into Play mode, you get a sense of what you are trying to achieve.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The previous Sequencer class takes care of the character animations,

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as well as the animated time of day and the lights coming on towards the end of the animation.

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In this class, you learn to set and animate various camera shots and arrange them to play in a certain order in Sequencer, as seen in the playback.

8
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Exit Play mode when done and load the map named 01 Cinematics Cam Pan.

9
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You still have the characters and light animations, but this will be your starting point to create various camera shots.

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Select and load the level sequence.

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You can see the current animated tracks, but nothing that relates to camera shots just yet.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
To create these camera shots, you first need to create physical cameras. In Unreal Engine 5, you need to create Cine Camera Actors.

13
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Cine cameras are a relatively new addition to Unreal Engine. They are meant to replace the older camera system that had less to offer.

14
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In the Add to Project panel, if you do a search for camera, you'll see multiple options.

15
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Note the two options that read Camera Actor and Cine Camera Actor.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Camera Actor is the older method of working. You can still use it, but as stated before, it's old technology that has less to offer.

17
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
As you place a camera actor in the scene, you can see a preview of the camera shot,

18
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but in the Details panel, there's very little in terms of parameters.

19
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can switch between perspective and orthographic projection modes,

20
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
change the field of view,

21
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and fiddle a bit with the aspect ratio, but that's about it.

22
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Delete this camera and try the same with the Cine Camera.

23
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Placement is just as easy, but note how many more properties are available in the Details panel.

24
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You have Tracking settings that enable you to follow another actor,

25
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you can set the film back to match real-world cameras,

26
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
choose from various lens settings,

27
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and adjust their parameters,

28
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
adjust focal length and f-stops,

29
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and even manually adjust the focus settings for specific shot types.

30
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
To test it out, you can right-click the camera and pilot it to place it in the right spot.

31
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You'll notice that you have focus effects already, but you can adjust them further to your liking.

32
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
At any time, you can exit or eject Cinecam mode and go back to your perspective view.

33
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You can go back to it by piloting the camera again or by using the viewport menu.

34
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The focus method can be set to Do Not Override and let the post-process handle focus for you.

35
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It can be set to Disable to completely turn it off.

36
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It can be set to Tracking and thus be dependent on an actor you're tracking in the scene,

37
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
or it can be set to Manual which arguably gives you the most freedom.

38
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:05.000
In that mode, you can set the manual focus distance or use the eyedropper to pick a point on screen.

39
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Enabling the Debug Plane makes it easier to view the focus plane.

40
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Right now, the focus is on the background and the dancing mannequin is blurred.

41
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You can change that by adjusting the focal distance, bringing the dancing mannequin into focus and blurring the background.

42
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
With cameras in the scene, you can use them to override the post-process volume effects.

43
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
For example, you can set the camera exposure to be different from the rest of the scene or maybe decide on a black and white or a stylized shot.

44
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You'll notice that this effect will only influence this camera and nothing else in the scene.

45
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You can toggle the camera effect to see the results or even eject the camera view altogether.

46
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The perspective view and the camera thumbnail show two totally different results.

47
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Now that you have covered the basics of a cine camera, it is time to animate its motion.

48
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
In the next section, you'll animate a simple panning motion.

49
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Delete this camera before moving on, you won't need it in the next section.
