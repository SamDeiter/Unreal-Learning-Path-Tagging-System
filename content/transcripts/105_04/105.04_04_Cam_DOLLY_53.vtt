00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Continue from the last section or load the level named 02 Cinematics Cam Dolly. Earlier, you animated the camera by moving it linearly from point A to point B.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you need the camera to follow a particular path, you could theoretically create multiple keyframes along a trajectory, but that seldom translates into a smooth transition.

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In the real world, you'd usually rely on a dolly or a rig rail. You have such a tool in Unreal Engine.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's animate a camera across the grass looking at the plaza.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Using the Add to Project icon, look inside the Cinematics section and drag Camera-Rig Rail Actor into the scene.

6
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Reorient it towards the plaza.

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The rig has a path. Select the endpoint and move it across the grass.

8
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Holding Alt down, move it again to create an additional point on the path.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
All three points can now be adjusted for locations and tangents.

10
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You can add more points if you need to.

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now that you have the rig in place, you can create a camera actor to link to it.

12
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Keep in mind it can be a different actor, like a car or a character. But for now, we need a camera to follow the rig.

13
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Add a cine camera to the scene.

14
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Name it Cam Dolly.

15
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Name it Cam Dolly.

16
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But before you move it to the cameras folder, link it first to the rail rig.

17
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Zero out the camera coordinates to match the rig's position in space, but then move it up in space to a human height level.

18
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Reorient it to look at the plaza.

19
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
At this point, you can move both the rig rail and the camera to the cameras folder.

20
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You may need to relink the camera to the path.

21
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If you select the rail and change its current position on rail value, you can see the camera traveling alongside it.

22
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The Lock Orientation to Rail option enables the camera to rotate as it travels,

23
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but this may be more suitable for a vehicle traveling along a path than a camera, as a good camera shot typically needs a focal point.

24
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So instead, we'll set the camera to track a focal point, something to look at as it travels through space.

25
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is done by selecting the camera and enabling the Look At tracking feature.

26
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
By selecting an object in the scene, such as the dancing character,

27
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then scrubbing through the rail position, you'll see the camera focusing on one subject.

28
00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
However, the dancing character may not be the best focal point as it's bouncing up and down like a bunny rabbit, and that could ultimately ruin the camera shot.

29
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Instead, simply create a non-renderable actor to act as a focal point.

30
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This way, you can place it in the scene exactly where you need it, and even possibly animate it for subtle focal point changes.

31
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You are now ready to animate the camera in Sequencer, but first, a word of warning.

32
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The rig rail itself is by default visible in the scene and will render if seen in a camera shot.

33
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
To prevent that from happening, make sure you disable the Render Render button.

34
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This will allow you to render the scene in a single shot, and the camera will be able to see the scene in the same way.

35
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
To prevent that from happening, make sure you disable its Show Rail Visualization option.

36
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If your Level Sequence is not open, select it in the viewport and open it.

37
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You can minimize all the existing tracks and then add both the Camera Rig Rail actor and the Dolly Camera itself to the Sequence.

38
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
For now, we are mostly interested in the Current Position on Rail option of the Rig Rail, so add the track for that.

39
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We already have a camera pan animation running between frame 0 and 300. We'll ensure the next animation runs between 300 and 600 or thereabout.

40
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Go to about frame 270. This will ensure a small one-second overlap between the previous and the new camera shots.

41
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
At frame 270, create a keyframe with the rig camera at 0 or at the beginning of the rail position.

42
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.000
At around 630, create a keyframe at position 1 or the end of the rail position.

43
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Scrub the animation to see the camera move along the path.

44
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Somewhere around frame 300, maybe around frame 295, you need to switch the cameras from one cut to the next.

45
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
If you activate the Camera Cuts track, it is currently viewing the camera pan shot only.

46
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But at frame 295, you can easily add a different shot by using the Plus button. In this case, we need a cut to the Dolly Cam.

47
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
As you scrub through the animation, you are now transitioning between the two shots.

48
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Save your work. In the next section, you'll add the third shot, one that is created with the help of a crane.
