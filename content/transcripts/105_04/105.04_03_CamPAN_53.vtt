00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
Continue your work from the last section. If you have just opened your project, you will need to load the level named 01 Cinematics Cam Pan.

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.000
You'll also need to select and open the level sequence in anticipation of more animation work.

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.500
You'll start with a simple motion, with a camera panning in the scene, essentially moving in a straight line from point A to point B.

4
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.300
In the last section, you learned how to place a camera in the scene and adjust its transforms.

5
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:46.100
Sometimes, an easier way to place a camera is to adjust your perspective view, and then choose the Create Camera Here option in the Viewport menu.

6
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.300
You can then switch to the Camera View to fine-tune it.

7
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:05.700
For a bit of housekeeping, you can rename the camera to Cam Pan,

8
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.700
and place it in a new folder called Cameras.

9
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.400
If you scrub the animation at this stage, you'll notice it is about 1000 frames long, with a few characters animated and others posed.

10
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.400
The time of day is also animated, as are some lights in the scene around frame 600.

11
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:41.400
If you want to mute some of these animations, such as the time of day or solar time, you can do so with a right-click on the track.

12
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.000
To animate the camera, you need to add it to Sequencer. This is easily done with a click and drag from the Outliner.

13
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.500
It adds a camera track with the core properties that can be animated, and then adds a camera track with the same properties.

14
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can also add a camera track to the sequence, and then add a camera track to the sequence.

15
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.100
You can also add a camera track with the core properties that can be animated, such as Transforms, Aperture and Focal Length.

16
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.100
But it also adds a Camera Cuts track, where you can define various camera shots to be played in sequence.

17
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.100
The little camera icon in the camera track lets you toggle between what the camera sees and a regular view.

18
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.200
The same icon on the Camera Cuts track will let you view the camera shots as you define them in the track.

19
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.200
Currently, it is hard to see, as you only have one camera, so we'll revisit this one.

20
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.200
For now, let's animate the camera. At frame 0, make sure the camera is active, ensure it is in a starting spot you like and create a Transform keyframe for it.

21
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
This will simultaneously create location, rotation and scale keyframes.

22
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.100
We don't really need a scale keyframe, so an alternative would have been to create keyframes for location and rotation only. This will do fine though.

23
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.700
Scrub through to about frame 300. That's about a third of the current animation length.

24
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.900
Move the camera to the right by driving it, and set another Transform keyframe.

25
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.400
Scrub between these two keyframes to see the end results. You can also playback the animation using the playback controls.

26
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.200
To restrict the playback between frame 0 and 300, you can adjust the playback range.

27
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.400
You can define the range by dragging the green and red markers,

28
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.900
or by using the square brackets as specific frames. In this case, using the left bracket at frame 0,

29
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.700
and the right bracket at frame 300.

30
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.700
If you want the animation to loop, you can adjust the last icon in the playback controls accordingly.

31
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:49.400
Note the ease-in, ease-out nature of the camera pan. I actually like this, but if you prefer to fine-tune that effect, or indeed eliminate it and replace it with a linear motion, you can certainly do that.

32
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.900
You can select the Transform track, and open the Curve Editor to adjust the tangents.

33
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.900
But for a linear effect, you can simply select all keyframes and turn their interpolation to Linear.

34
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.900
If you don't need the power of the Curve Editor, you can make keyframe interpolation changes directly in Sequencer.

35
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.900
So now we have our first camera animation. Before we move on to the next, there's one last viewing mode to mention.

36
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.900
We talked about Cinematic View versus Array View.

37
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.900
There's also the option to use a Cinematic Viewport, which adds playback controls to the view.

38
00:05:45.900 --> 00:06:06.480
You can also use the

39
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.400
You can use it in conjunction with the Camera Cuts track to view what the cameras are looking at.

40
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.400
The advantage of this mode is that it still gives you access to playback controls if you go full-screen using F11.

41
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.400
This will give you more real estate to view your camera compositions and better analyze your shots.

42
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.400
Save your work. In the next section, you create a dolly shot using a Rig Rail.

43
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.900
Thanks for watching!
