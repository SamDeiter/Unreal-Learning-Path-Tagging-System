1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Continue from the last section or open the level named 03 Cinematics Cam Crane.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here you'll experiment with yet another animated camera option by using a crane.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The workflow is similar to what you did in the last section, but you'll be using a crane rig instead of a ray rig.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Make sure your level sequence is accessible in the level. You will need it to animate the rig later.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To create a rig, use the Cinematics menu like you did before.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It looks different from the ray rig obviously, but it operates just as easily.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Move it into the Cameras folder.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Note that you can control and later animate options like Pitch, and Yaw, and Arm Length as you see fit.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Much like you did before, you can easily create a new camera,

10
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
name it adequately,

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and link it to the rig.

12
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
By resetting its location, it will match the head of the rig arm.

13
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The camera is currently fixed on a single point,

14
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but as earlier, you can pick a point of your choice by using a non-rendered actor in the scene.

15
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You can create and rename such an actor Crane Focus,

16
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
move it to the Cameras folder,

17
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and then set its location at a point of interest in the scene, maybe near the penthouse.

18
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can always adjust it later.

19
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Once you have done that, you can use the camera's tracking options to look at the null actor.

20
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This will ensure the camera is looking at a fixed point once you start adjusting or animating the rig's features.

21
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To animate this rig and create a camera shot, let's add both the crane rig and its associated camera into the level sequence.

22
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There's a chance the Solar Time Track may be muted currently.

23
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You may want to unmute it at this time.

24
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The same is true for the Materials Parameter Collection which controls the exterior lighting.

25
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Let's animate the crane shot somewhere between frames 500 and 1000.

26
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Scrub to frame 500 or thereabout.

27
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000
At frame 500, you need to pin the crane in place. For that, you need to keyframe the pitch and yaw values as well as the arm length.

28
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
If you've already set these as an animation start, you're good to go.

29
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In Sequencer, you need to create tracks for all three values.

30
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But you can also use the Details panel as a shortcut.

31
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Using the Details panel, you can add a keyframe for the crane pitch, the yaw and the arm length and that also creates the necessary tracks in Sequencer.

32
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Go to the end of the animation and fiddle with these three values to result with a different camera position.

33
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I prefer to use Sequencer to update the keyframe values.

34
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:44.000
If you need to, add another set of keyframes midway through for better interpolation.

35
00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Do not worry about the light flickering, these artifacts will not show in the final rendering.

36
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:22.000
When you're done, you can activate the Camera Shots track and add the crane shot for the last part of the sequence, at around frame 580.

37
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Scrub or playback the animation to view the results.

38
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We'll cover rendering starting with the next section but before you go, note that the crane may be visible in some camera shots.

39
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
To prevent that from happening, you can go to the beginning of the animation at frame 0,

40
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
enable the option Hidden in-game

41
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and keyframe it. This adds a visibility track which now has a small keyframe set to black, which means the object will be invisible throughout.

42
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It has indeed disappeared from the camera shots.

43
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Save your work before you move on to the next section.
