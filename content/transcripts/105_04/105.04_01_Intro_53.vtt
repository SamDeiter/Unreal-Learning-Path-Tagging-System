Hello, and welcome to this session on Cinematics for Architecture in Unreal Engine.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.600
My name is Amer Yasin, and I will be your instructor.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.280
This is a follow-up to the Sequencer for Architecture introductory class.

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.880
Make sure you have familiarized yourself with the process of using Sequencer in UE5 before

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.160
tackling this one.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.600
Here you'll learn about creating cinematic shots in Sequencer by experimenting with

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.400
cine cameras and what they have to offer.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.840
You'll learn how to create and set up such cameras, how to animate them in different

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.760
ways, and ultimately how to output high-quality stills and animations to disk using various

10
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.560
techniques, including Movie Render Queue.

11
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.560
Let's start.
