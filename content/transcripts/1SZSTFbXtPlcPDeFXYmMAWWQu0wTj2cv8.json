  "text": " Next up, let's have a look at distance fields and how they can be used with the materials. So this is, I've got a slide 14. You'll see this rather ominous black and white zone. So I'm using a post-process volume to sort of generate this sort of visual interpretation of distance fields. And if I hit simulate here, this was going to look a little bit better. So you can see what's happening is we are getting a higher value around where two meshes are going to intersect. So the concept behind distance fields is it is the distance you are from a close edge to another surface. So as more surfaces become interconnected, you'll get a brighter color. Now, this will be in the same value as if we were looking at the depth tests and the custom depth tests. The values aren't usually in zero to one, they're in sort of numbers of centimeters. So if you plug this value directly in, you're going to get a really, really high value and it's not going to be much use to you. But you can do a little bit of math to group okra in order to get some good effects out of it. OK, so next, let's have a look at the different kind of effects you can generate. So this is a false field type effect. You can see in this as the fields pass through the mesh, I'm using the distance fields as a method of creating this sort of outline to make it look like it's intersected. So this is just sort of one good use of it in a relatively sort of static material. Now, next up, what we have on slide 16 is this little sign. In order to see this functioning, you really need to play in the editor. So if you use the A, W and S, S and D keys, you can move around in the space to jump. You can see the effect of how this material is adapting to the environmental grounder. I think it's most prominent when you can see it sort of coming over the edge here as we move about. And it's got a couple of other just sort of little effects in it to make use the world position offset to make it bob up and down. But it can give you a really, really pleasant sort of feeling of it adapting and sort of a meta ball if you've ever worked with with Blender. The material is adapting to the closeness of the outer elements. Now, if I was to jump in, let's have a quick look at the slide material. Now, there's quite a bit in here, so I won't try and break it all down. But the primary bits that we are interested in are it's the distance to nearest surface. So you can see here, this is how I'm getting the distance field in there. So this is going to provide us with a value which is between which is in centimeters. And then we're going to have a value of about a centimeter. And that's going to allow us to manipulate and edit materials accordingly. I've used parameters in most cases here because it's really tricky to get those numbers absolutely sort of spot on. But the distance the nearest surface is what's going to allow you to do these kind of things. Probably the easiest example is still this force field. If I was to open up a force field, I would have to do this. Probably the easiest example is still this force field. If I was to open it up, you can see that we have the... You can see that we have the... Where's the distance to? Yeah, the distance the nearest surface. And I'm just having to do some maths on it in order to build out a distance field mask. So that is that is that the maths that I've used in this instance just to create the mask around the distance field. So if I was to take that and plug that directly into the emissive and then apply and simulate, you'll be able to see when they pass through, you can see it's just that mask which is penetrating the mesh.",
