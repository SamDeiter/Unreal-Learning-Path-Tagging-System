  "text": " So, after going through the cooking process, let's look at how we're actually packaging our game now. So as you saw at the start, we kind of just went off the default project settings, but let's talk about the different options available to us here. So even though there are more settings that we are outside the scope of this course, we want to highlight the development build and shipping build. These two options are things that you'll be using most frequently. There are other packaging options, like I said, and I've included a link just to a full breakdown of this in the documentation below. But let's take a look at development and shipping first. So the purpose of development build, I mean, as the name states, you know, it's for internal testing and development. We do have the shipping option and that's more for public release and distribution. Now, that being said, there's no harm in testing shipping builds every now and then. You know, say for every 10 builds you make, maybe one of them is shipping or maybe you have a higher percentage, but you don't only want to be testing development builds. And then the first time your shipping build is tested is on the end user. That's not a good process. But for the most part, development will be where you're doing your development builds and shipping is where you're doing your shipping builds. Like I said, every nine times out of 10, maybe development and then every 10th build, maybe shipping or something, some kind of ratio like that, depending on your development process, of course. So what do we get in each of these builds? So in development, we've got debugging and the login included. Whereas, you know, for obvious reasons, we want to remove this from the shipping build because we don't want end players giving access to any of the debug information. In development, we do have the console commands and profiling tools and visual debugging, which is disabled and removed in shipping builds. For the most part, I will caveat this in that there are a few talks online from Unreal Fest and other places about actually getting access to some profiling in shipping builds. But, you know, for the most part, this is disabled and removed in shipping builds. In development builds, because they're focusing on deploying the build and not for shipping, these tend to be less optimized and it's just focusing on the functionality and debugging and it does have a larger file size due to extra data. This is why I was saying that you don't just want to be only testing development builds. You do want to be testing shipping builds every now and then because they're going to be optimized for performance on your target platforms. It's going to be most in line with your file size because it removes all the extra data. So if you're looking to really squeeze out every millisecond for your performance or you're looking for a certain disk size download, that's why you'd want to test your shipping builds. You really want to know what the end user is experiencing and seeing. So, you know, development builds are there for the purpose of faster iteration, but they will be less optimized and have a larger file size because of that. Now, for the development builds, you should not be deploying or distributing these development builds. I mean, you obviously can do, but it's not intended for public release. But the deployment is simpler, whereas the shipping build, once you finish your project and it's ready to ship, this is intended for public release and, you know, platform specific packaging and your DRM. So hopefully that gives you a good overview of the two different build options and why you might use one over the other. So, as I mentioned at the very start of this course, hopefully you could have just gone to package your project, clicked package for Windows and everything would have worked great. And that's the course over and done with. And you don't need to listen to my voice anymore. But some of you will have experienced broken builds and it may not package right out of the box and it may not be as easy as I made it seem. So if you if you do get errors, how do I fix these errors? Hopefully we can get into all of these things to help you out. So packaging when you're working on games should be run at regular intervals. We should be able to package at least, you know, weekly and not run into build errors. And this will help you clean errors as you go. If you're on a three month game project and you only wait till month 28 to package, that's probably not ideal. You just want to be keeping these builds going as frequently as you can. So just get ahead of errors, especially if you're working with any, you know, downloaded content or any files where you have people that aren't as familiar with Unreal developing or anything like this. You really want to any large project changes, you want to make sure everything is packaging OK. You also want to ensure that there are no extraneous references to any of the assets that we're using and that we're deleting anything across the project that we're not using. So this is kind of a common, a common occurrence that we see in blueprints where, you know, we're testing all these different variables. You can see this image at the bottom right where I've just got this test pool and I've got this new vector and I was just like, create this variable. This is like, I'll delete this when I'm done testing. Like I shouldn't leave this around. I've got my final, final variable that ends up ultimately not being my final variable. And you've just got these random variables just left behind. So I was trying to prototype something quickly. You would be surprised at the amount of issues that these can cause. They might be misreferenced somewhere. They can just cause headaches. So where possible, you know, when you are working in blueprints, just try and keep things clean and organized. It doesn't hurt to categorize your variables and keep things ordered. But these can cause packaging issues. So you should work with good blueprint communication and structures, especially when you're thinking about packaging and shipping projects here. We can also update redirect references. So this should be done at regular intervals as well. But what you can do is you can click one of your subfolders here. I would not recommend just doing the kitchen sink approach and right clicking on the full content folder. I would go subfolder at a time and just fix up redirects as you go. And just to explain what redirects are, they're almost like breadcrumbs left behind in Unreal Engine. So say I made a blueprint and I had intended to put it in the blueprints folder, but for some reason I put it in this audio folder. And in Unreal Engine, what I can do is I can just move the blueprint. I can drag and drop it over into the blueprints folder and it'll say, do I want to move it here? And I'm like, yeah, I want to move it here. Now, what Unreal Engine will do is it'll leave an invisible blueprints, invisible redirects behind. You can show these redirects in your content browser flags, you know, the visibility flags, but essentially they're invisible by default. And when packaging, although Unreal Engine knows that your blueprint is in the blueprints folder, it first goes to the audio folder because that was the original place that it was in. And it says, is this blueprint in the audio folder? And it'll find a redirector and it'll say, oh, no, it's not in the audio folder, it's in the blueprints folder now. And then, you know, that's an extra process that Unreal has to go through to then find your blueprint to help package it. That in itself would maybe work, you know, it's kind of project specific, but, you know, that might work. It's not to say that all redirectors won't package, but you can imagine this happening on multiple different occasions. And this is why I say don't just click your content folder because there might be redirectors or redirectors. Say you've put something in your audio folder that's moved to the character folder, that's moved to the blueprints folder or something like this. And if you just right click in the content folder, Unreal might get confused about which director was supposed to go in which chain. It starts trying to clean stuff up and you break everything. So this should be almost like a project spring clean, where you just keep this going. By spring clean, I don't mean do it once a year. Do it on a frequent basis, especially as part of your packaging process. But you want to be updating these redirectors because there's no need for the most part on these projects to have the redirectors left behind. So just make sure you're updating the redirectors as you go. What you can do as well. So some teams might be prototyping in a project and they may have just loads of this prototype content and they may just want to move to a brand new clean project. That's just like, right. We know that this is an empty project. We know that we want to keep this nice and organized. And you can actually get content across from one project to the next by right clicking. Say you want a level migrating. You can right click on a level. Go to asset actions and click migrate. And what migrate will do is it will take that level with all of its references across to the new project. Now, this is quite a heavy handed way of doing things. It's not advised to just do this by default and it'll work straight out of the box. There are complications that happen. It tends to work better on large or smaller asset references. Say you've got maybe a sound cue and a sound WAV and you want to migrate the sound cue and then it'll take the WAV with it and it'll keep everything referenced correctly. That tends to work OK. However, if it's a level with loads of referencing, it can, you know, trip up a little bit. But if you really need to use migrate for any reason, you know, use it sparingly, use it in an organized way, but it can help, you know, strip out some of the unused content and into a clean project. And then you can attempt to package that. Just remembering to fix up your redirectors as well after that. Now, if you are if your project is, you know, clean and you're having issues, say you just download the Unreal Engine third person template or first person template and you try and package that and it's not packaging. So first of all, if you try to package your existing game project and it doesn't package, try to include, try to just load, you know, a default epic template from the launcher. It doesn't matter what template it is and just try and package that. If that package is OK, then it's an issue with your game projects and we need to go back and, you know, fix redirectors, delete variables, do any of the house cleaning that we need to do on that project. However, if your computer isn't packaging, you know, the first person template or the third person template and that's the thing that's breaking, then it'll be an issue with the code that you've got installed. So the first thing to do is make sure you download the correct version of Visual Studio. You could download the Visual Studio community, make sure you have the purple Visual Studio icon and not the blue icon, which is Visual Studio code. Make sure you have the correct SDKs installed. Now, this might be outdated as the time of watching, I'm not sure, but essentially just check the SDKs that you need and there may be some SDKs involved. Also, this last redistributable check, check that you've got that installed too. So there's some helpful links. You'll no doubt you'll find helpful forum posts online of just making sure you have the correct Visual Studio and SDKs installed. But these are a quick go to and then just try packaging that default Unreal Engine template, say the third person template. If that package is OK, then go to your game project, check that that package is and if not, then it'll be something to do with your game content. So hopefully those links help when trying to debug packaging your project.",
