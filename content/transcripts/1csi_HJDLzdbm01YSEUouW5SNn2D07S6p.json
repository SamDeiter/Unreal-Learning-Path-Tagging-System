  "text": " And then the last topic on this course is the visual data prep. So let's talk about what is visual data prep, the user interface, and also the workflow around visual data prep. So visual data prep is an asset that you can create in the content browser, much like a material or a blueprint. So if you just right click in some empty space, go to data prep, you have the data prep asset that you can then create. It gives you access to intuitive node base editor to control actions such as tessellation, merging objects, creating LODs or substituting materials, among other things. So a preview displays the result before committing to the import process, and you can save your data prep graphs for later use. So again, talking about that automation side of things, we want to code once and repeat those actions, we have the ability to do that with visual data prep. So the user interface is probably similar to some of the other interfaces you've seen whilst navigating Unreal Engine 5 with a few subtle differences here. So we've got the toolbar at the top. We've also got the content browser preview in number two here, which is where you can see all the individual properties there. And then you've got your meme viewport, which you can pan around to view the impact of what we're editing here. We've got the world outline and preview, which again, similar to other level editor windows you may have seen. And then we've got the input output settings panel on the top right hand side here. Next, we have the palette of things we can choose from to then drag and drop into our data preparation recipe panel, which is where you'll be compiling all of these recipes. And then you've got a details panel per element that you are selecting here. So the process of using visual data prep is that you import, execute and then commit. So we load a data Smith file using the settings panel that we referenced on the previous slide. You can then use the import button to preview the DS file. You build your recipe from the bottom left hand side here, number six, and then drag them into the next window. And then you use the execute button on the toolbar to preview the results. So if you need to make changes to the recipe, you can make the necessary changes and then execute it again. So you're constantly iterating to find the best process that works for you. And then when all is working to your satisfaction, use the commit button and send the scene to UE5. So the flow of events works from top to bottom and then from file left to right. So we're going top to bottom, left to right, and then choose from a set of selection tools and drag and add operations to the selection. So as we were talking about from our palette, we can drag these across into the main recipe window. Then we can save and reuse our recipes for when we need them. So the actions and operations for the recipe maker that you can filter selections in a single or an array of nodes. So when you're looking at single here, you'll see that it's just that one line, which is the variable type in inside of Unreal Engine. And then the variable type for an array are these nine blocks. And then you'll know that you're either using a single mode or an array mode. And then you can create a selection filter by selecting objects in the outliner. And this can be useful if actors are difficult to differentiate because maybe similar labels or lack of tags or some kind of metadata inconsistency. So the process here is that you select the actor in the outliner, which you can see at the top right hand side here. You can right click in an empty space in the recipe window, choose a filter from selection. And now you have a selection that is available in your recipe. And then you can add further operators. And then to talk about the actions and operations a little bit more. So we group horizontal actions vertically to save space. And the process for this is that you select horizontal actions that go together, right click on the title bar of the first action, and then choose group actions. And that will allow you to group horizontal actions vertically to save yourself some space.",
