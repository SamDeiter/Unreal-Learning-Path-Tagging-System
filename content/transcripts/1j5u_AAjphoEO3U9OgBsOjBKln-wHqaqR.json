  "text": " Now that we have our platforms placed inside of our level, let's go ahead and talk about working with their properties. Now, if we click on the platforms and look under the default section in the details panel, we're going to find all the various things that we can do. Now, these platforms are set up to allow the end user. Now, these platforms are set up so that we can select different types of power-ups. The power-ups we have are time, score, and jump. We can also adjust the score, jump, and power amount that is given for each one of these pickups. We also have things like rotate, duration, falling, enable platform, movement, L2 and L1. All of these allow us to add a little bit of functionality to our platforms to make them a little more fun to interact with. Let's go ahead and take a look at these properties now inside of the editor. Here, I have one of my platforms selected. Let's take a look at the pickup type. I can set that to jump, score, time, or none. Now, the reason I'd want none is if I spawn in here or maybe I want maybe a little bit of space in between the platforms, I can set that so it's not spawning anything. Each one of these that I set, I could then adjust its amount down here. If I make something a little bit harder to get to, I can make the reward a little bit higher for it, or if it's a little easier to get to, I can make the reward a little lower. I also have the ability to change the color of the text for each one of the jump, score, or time power-ups. This way, we can make it more easy for the player to see. The other thing that these platforms allow us to do are things like fall or move. If I enable platform movement and I grab this little diamond right here, this will be the start and the end location. Let me just go ahead and press play. We'll see here that it starts and then it will actually, whoops, let me do that one more time. It will start over there and then it will move back and forth. We can have it go up and down as well. I'm just happy to show it going from side to side. Now, we can control the duration or the time that it takes to get from this location to this location by adjusting this duration right here. If I was to set this to one and play, we're going to see it goes extremely fast. If I was to set this to, say, 25, it's going to go frustratingly slow. Other cool things that I can do with this is I'm going to disable a platform movement for now and enable rotate. Nothing is happening, but as soon as I jump on this, this platform will start to rotate. Then the other option that I have here is the ability for a falling platform. I'm going to enable this and then you can see here as I jump on that it will fall in the world after me. That's a really cool little feature there. What I want everybody to do now that you know how these things are working, spend some time adjusting the platforms that you placed in the previous section so that you make a little jumping puzzle. As I mentioned before, you do have the ability to change the amount that's awarded for a score or time, and you even can change the amount of power that's given for jump. Make a few of your puzzles or make a few of them harder to get to, but increase the reward amount for that to reflect the amount of effort that it takes to get there. When you're done, you should have the five platforms and probably anything less than a minute worth of gameplay.",
