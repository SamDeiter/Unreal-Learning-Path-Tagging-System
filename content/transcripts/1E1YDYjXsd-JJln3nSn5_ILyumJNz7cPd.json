  "text": " In this next section, we want to do a quick overview of our tracking solution, plugins, and system operations as we prepare for our lens file calibration. You'll see here in Virtual Production and ICDFX a list of our plugins. The plugins that you have here in blue, the AJA Media Player, Black Magic Media Player, Camera Calibration, LED Wall Calibration, Live Link Camera, Live Link Lens, and OpenCV Lens Distortion are all the plugins that we need active for our calibration. Now, as I mentioned before, the Latte Stage uses the OptiTrack system with Motive, and we need to have those OptiTrack Live Link and Streaming Client plugins made available for our Unreal Engine plugin. Anything that you see here in orange, those are our Virtual Production related plugins, and those can be implemented as well. Now, our options for our tracking system. The Latte Stage, as I've mentioned, uses the OptiTrack Motive system for performance capture and for our camera and object tracking. We also use this for nodal point calibration and lens distortion mapping, but there are other options that are available to you. ViKON Shogun, the Vive Tracker, as well as the Vive Mars system. Note, you want to make sure that when doing camera tracking, it should be active as part of your stage setup. Your tracking setup, including setting the origin point, or the 000 of your tracking volume, for camera calibration and lens distortion mapping, are also covered in some of this course. However, there is plenty of documentation on the various vendors' tracking solution websites, and there's a lot of video documentation that you can follow to go through these steps on your own. Now, in our next section, we're going to take a look at some of our camera control systems before we build ourselves a virtual live link subject.",
