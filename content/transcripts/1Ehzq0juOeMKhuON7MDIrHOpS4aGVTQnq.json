  "text": " Now that we've had an overview of Unreal Engine, let's talk about the specific project logic to give you more context about how to work with Unreal Engine. Starting out, if you have a background in film, this next section is a series of comparison charts, features, and organization that might help smooth the transition from traditional filmmaking to using Unreal Engine for real-time production. As you can see in this chart under the Film section, we have the standards you should already be familiar with. In an Unreal Engine, we can emulate these by thinking of our Engine components as similar to our traditional components. So our location or backlot becomes our project, and inside that we can break down levels to serve as the soundstage. From there, we can think of a sublevel as a set, and on those sets we have static and skeletal mesh actors that serve as our props and performing actors. Finally, all the various crew, lights, cameras, and other components that make the magic happen can be replicated through the various components in the Engine. So Unreal being a game engine, it has a more modular approach to building worlds. Plus, it has additional classifications of objects in order to create the game aspect of the Engine. And you can use these classes to your distinct advantage as you understand the new terminology, such as the unique terms and actor classes that are broken down here into Engine terminology and Sequencer terminology. Now with Engine terminology, we'll discuss things like static and skeletal meshes, actors, pawns, and characters, world, maps, and levels, level sequences, control rig, volumes, blueprints, and source control. While Sequencer specific terminology will discuss scene assemblies, performance takes, sets, layouts, or staging, and level sequence with shots, and shots. All right, you just heard me use a term that you might not be familiar with as it relates to Unreal Engine, and that's Sequencer. So what is Sequencer? Well, Sequencer is the Unreal Engine's non-linear editor and assembly tool that is primarily used for ground-up shot creation. This can then be utilized for pre-visualization, full end-to-end film creation, and game cinematic event creation, all of which is done by using actors from the Outliner or assets from the Content Browser, adding them directly into Sequencer to create level sequence assemblies. Now you also just heard me say level sequence assemblies, so you must be wondering, what is a level sequence? Well, level sequences are cinematic sequence containers used to create animated footage of actors with their scenes or shots that can be shuffled, trimmed, or time stretched and rendered. Level sequences can also be deeply nested within each other, which serves as a core function of Sequencer assembly creation. Naturally, as Sequencer takes on the role of production hub, the most important aspect is going to be Sequencer's user interface. Now while future courses will dive deeper into Sequencer training, I want to introduce you to the four primary sections of the user interface. Feel free to pause here or take a screenshot for later reference as I take you through these sections. Now the first stop here is the toolbar. It's marked as section one on the slides, and from the toolbar we can do things such as add a cinematic camera and camera cuts track, adjust our frame rate, set automatic keyframes, adjust snapping options, activate our render options, save our level sequence, and activate our Sequencer curves editor. Over to the right side of the toolbar, we can also use the breadcrumb section to quickly navigate between nested level sequences. And the best way to do that is to double click onto whatever shot you want to navigate into, make changes, and then once you're done working, you just use the breadcrumbs to navigate your way back into the above level sequence container. Over to what is marked as section two in the slide is the Sequencer Outliner. This is where we can add or filter any tracks that we can use inside the Event Manager, which works to manage any of our shots, animations, characters, blueprints, fade tracks, groups, subscenes, and material parameter collections. To the right of the Event Manager is our timeline, and I've separated this out from the Event Manager as section number three because there is quite a bit that can be done here. This is where our playhead is located. Right at the top, it's the red arrow that you can use to scrub to the timeline, and its placement will impact where your edits and connections are made. The timeline also provides you access to the Tracks area, where you can actually see what is being worked on or is active. This is where any event triggers, animation tracks, control rig, camera, translation, or rotation movement, or any exposed parameters will be keyframed and animated. And that just leaves us with the final area, which is marked as section four on the slide, and that's the playback controls, located at the bottom. This is where our time range slaughter is adjusted, and it's also where we can do things like play, move between frames, and steps, or loop playback as needed. Here we can also record performances using the take recorder that is integrated into Sequencer. Now, I really want to emphasize here that Sequencer also acts as an Event Manager, and it can be used to trigger events in games or manage any kind of action exposed to Sequencer inside the level sequence that you're working on. Additionally, Sequencer has a built-in curves editor that allows your teams to adjust keyframes and curves as you're going through and animating or moving around assets inside the engine. And that Sequencer works with take recorder, cinematic assets, blueprints, Niagara, control rig, composure, and material parameters to allow for deeper control of all aspects of the scene assemblies. Now, as you begin working with Unreal Engine, it's important to consider how Unreal is set up to maintain project organization. As you can see in this slide, there are levels and sublevels that allow for better organization and collaborative compartmentalization. So your environment or your persistent level will contain anything that is universally shared within the entire project. Project sets, environments, or discipline-specific setups can live on their own sublevels. And to clarify, when I'm talking about levels, I'm referring to maps or worlds. I do not mean level sequences. There is a difference between these two assets. Levels get organized into sublevels and live under your persistent level depending on what is actually needed for your project or department. For example, your main lighting setup should live on your persistent level as it will be utilized by the entire project or production. Any level sequence-specific lighting setup should live in a Sequencer lighting comp sublevel so that anything specific to a level sequence that is spotable should be connected to that specific sublevel. That way it can get called in and out without affecting the persistent level and causing problems between users working with that persistent level by having the Sequencer-specific lighting turn on or off when that sublevel is not active. Now, another actor class that has a profound impact on setting up action in Unreal Engine is the use of a subscene track. A subscene essentially references an existing level sequence for the express purpose of layering multiple actions together. This type of organization allows you to create departmentalized level sequence organization so that teams of artists can work together in real time to construct distinct portions of the action based on department or discipline and that can be utilized in conjunction with sublevel organization. Just as we discussed for the lighting scenario, cinematography can do this for cine cameras. Other animations can have its own subscene, so all your characters and animations can live on an animation-specific sublevel as well. Level blueprints or level sequence blueprints, level sequence specific effects, anything that could be spotable or triggered can live on a sublevel under the persistent level and also be organized in Sequencer through the use of subscenes. One thing to note is that while subscene organization works well for most departmental organization, it does not work with the storyboarding tools at this time. Attempting to use a subscene for storyboards will cause the engine to crash, so be careful there. Finally, in Unreal Engine, you're going to come across terms that we use within the engine that will have a powerful impact on how you organize your level sequence shot assets. That new terminology is the possessable actor and the spotable actor, and I mentioned this a little bit earlier. But what does this mean? Well, actors within a level sequence can be one of these two categories. Possessable actors are intended to be possessed by each level sequence that calls them into use, but ultimately, these belong to the level and are active in that level the entire time. Spotable actors, on the other hand, exist within the unique level sequence and then disappear when the level sequence is outside of its play range, or no longer active. Basically, a spotable is like pulling a book down from a bookshelf, reading it, and then putting it away to use again later when needed. Each of these can prove beneficial depending on your needs and workflows, but one thing to note is that the EPO storyboarding tools do not currently support spotable actors at this time. That's it for this section. In our next section, we will wrap up our exploration of Unreal Engine by discussing the available animation support.",
