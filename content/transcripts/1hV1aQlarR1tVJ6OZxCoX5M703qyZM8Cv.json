  "text": " Before we jump into the engine, one last thing I wanted to touch on before you start putting work into setting up all the blueprints is just making sure that you have a strong foundation to your skeletal mesh so that everything you're doing in engine goes much more smoothly. Now there are some things that you need to think about before importing your vehicle. So spend some time just considering how your vehicle is going to move and about the hierarchy of bones that you need to create for your skeleton. So for example if you have a suspension system, consider how those different parts will be moving, where the pivots should be, what directions the bones should be oriented, just to help out with any of the blueprinting work or control rig work later down the pipeline. But for the absolute basics for the system to work, here are some useful tips that'll mean you're not fighting any of the default settings and your initial setup should be a lot easier basically. So your vehicle should be facing down the positive x axis. So whichever way you want your vehicle to be facing when they're driving, make sure that that's down the positive x axis. Something that helps for use in the wheel blueprint later on would be to measure the radius of your wheels because that's just some information that the wheel blueprint needs. When it comes to your joints and your skeleton, now it can be as complicated as you like or as simple as you like, but when it comes to a four wheeled vehicle, which is what we'll be setting up today, it needs a minimum of five bones in the skeleton and this would be one for the root and then four for the wheels. So one for each wheel. When you're placing and orienting your joints, this is specifically for the wheel and the root, make sure that they are x forward and z up and this will basically ensure that they roll on the y axis and steer on the z axis. And your wheel joints should be placed at the centre of your wheel mesh so that they rotate properly when rolling. And your wheel meshes should also be weighted to just one joint only so that there's no influence from other bones in the skeleton, otherwise you can get some real funky results. And as long as you stick to these basics and you get these ones correct, the rest of the setup and engine should be a lot more straightforward.",
