  "text": " Hi everyone. In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at the outline for this series of courses. And then we're also going to take a look at profiling. So let's get started. So first up, we'll talk about profiling concepts. From there, we'll look at types of rendering. We'll also look at concepts of thread profiling, how that works, calling concepts, calling methods, GPU visualizer, GPU draw thread, the CPU draw thread and how that plays, as well as the analyzing of draw calls in general, and looking at all Unreal insights. We'll then take a look at optimization visualizers. We'll look at using visualizers, some quick notes on those, and also a review of Lumen, Nanite and Virtual Shadow map visualizers, which we've covered in other classes. And then we'll also look at a few pro tips and some secret little visualizers that you can use to help with your workflow. Next, we'll look at Nanite in Virtual Shadows. Why use Nanite? Using it in Virtual Shadow Maps overview. We'll also look at a review of understanding LODs. Now, again, I say review because some of these are covered in your other classes. We'll look at editing and using LODs, LOD colorization, using poly edit tools, swapping geo, merging geo, and H-LODs and how that works. And finally, we'll end with review of texture material optimization, texture optimization, and material optimization. When it comes to working with Unreal. All right, let's go and get started. Optimization for linear content, profiling geometry, we're going to take a look now at profiling concepts. So some of the things you want to look at is the pros and cons when it comes to the types of rendering. There's forward rendering. And that is your typical use, or at least in the past, that is used to create a VR scenario, because it was a little bit lighter. But unfortunately, you would have some limitations on the type of light that you would use, which would make things a little bit trickier. The overhead or the idea behind it was so that things could be a little bit lighter. So you weren't using the full capacity of all the things in the engine, but you using just enough to be able to create a nice, efficient VR scenario. There's also deferred rendering. So deferred rendering is the old school way in which Unreal would bake your lighting. It would be fast is especially in small medium scenes and had lower realism compared to ray tracing and lumen. And it's largely a 2D operation calculates lighting with a proxy approximations is complex to use. Now, you'll notice in the first one forward, it says a number of features are not yet supported. But you don't have to worry about that so much. Now, you can actually use VR or build things in VR using lumen lumen now supports VR. So you don't have to actually set things in your project settings for forward rendering, which is kind of convenient. So looking at ray tracing and lumen, this is suited for complex effects, GI reflection, refraction and soft shadows. Now refraction is limited, you won't get the same as you would with ray tracing, you'll have to fake some of it, but there will be some ability that you have in here to simulate some of those options. But again, full caustics and refraction you're going to get from path tracer. It's easy to implement when it comes to ray tracing and lumen. It's more intuitive, reliable, realistic and mimics lights behavior. Only lumen is optimized though, keep in mind to be able to be used with ICV effects. Ray tracing leans more towards final pixel. That's because it takes a pretty big hit on your GPU. Now path tracing is not suited for real time. It is not real time or at least the idea of real time was not in mind when it was created. It's for rendering final pixel projects displays a more accurate light refraction and caustic effect takes longer to render than ray tracing or lumen due to sample settings used for better quality and renders each frame independently. It isn't like previous renders such as ray tracing and lumen, or if you rendered it in the movie render queue, it typically will reference the previous frame to be able to make the new one. Path tracer is a bit different. So you have to keep those things in mind and test things out as you go. Now again, that's for another class when we talk about path tracing, and we get into that in our ray tracing and path tracing courses. So when to use them. Again, as I said before, rasterization forward is mainly used for AR and VR, because it's dumbed down to be able to make things work a little bit more efficiently. rasterization or deferred baking lights. This one can be used in your typical game scenario, if you need and can be used for virtual production if needed. Ray tracing also can be used for virtual production, but is mainly its focus is on final pixel, such as with movies and so forth. Now we do have some of our ray tracing clients, such as automotive and architecture that will use ray tracing quite often. But again, a lot of the times it's not necessarily for interaction, although it can be used for interaction, you just have to optimize your materials and your items in your scene accordingly. So you get the best frame rate that you possibly can. Lumen is one of the more efficient ways to be able to work and is now unreal out of the box. As soon as you fire up Unreal, you'll see that Lumen is working. And you'll go in there and be able to check off some of the things to make it work appropriately. We go into that into another class when we talk about lighting optimization. But for the most part, it is ready for ICV effects, and also games, as well as final pixel. Path tracing, like we said before, is mainly for final pixel made for film and TV. And you can keep that focus using it because it really does give you some high realistic refractions and caustics and it's really great to use. So let's go and take a look here at draw calls for a moment. So draw calls here are very important to consider a package of triangles. And what it is, is a package of triangles being sent to the GPU. The GPU renders draw calls by draw call, not triangle by triangle. So in other words, each mesh material is a different draw call. So as you see here down below on this example, you'll see that this sky dome is a draw call. This piece of geo here is a draw call, the floor is a draw call. This other piece of geo, number four, is a draw call and number five. But as soon as you introduce a new material, that becomes a new draw call. So materials and the geometry are to be considered. And each one, if you have too many, are not optimized, you're not been using material instances or merging when you can, you can end up having a really huge scene, which has a lot of draw calls, and that's going to hit your frames. So think of it this way, if you don't do that, if you don't merge geometry, if you don't optimize what materials you're using, if you don't do those things, you can imagine it such as a single image copying a single one gig file versus copying one million KB files. It's going to eat up time, it's going to processing. You want to be able to work efficiently. And again, consider your materials, dumb down your textures as things in the distance, merge geometry, which is, which you can find is okay to do so. It's not maybe something that doesn't animate, it's not interactive, you don't have to interact with. So you have to think deterministically, and that's with games as well as film. So let's take a look at what's being processed here. And we're going to be using a console command called stat unit. Stat unit works really well. This allows us to see our frame total time to finish each frame, our game information, C++ and blueprint game play operations, our draw CPU render time and GPU render time. Now we've added a few since this particular graphic, this gives you an overhead of some of the main things you'll be looking at for the most part. But there are some others, as you can see off to the right, because this once you run this console command, it will show up to your right towards the top. And you'll see a few others in here, such as our Dynarez draws, prims, as well as a newer one called RHIT. So let's actually break these down. RHIT. So frame number shows you the total time your hardware took to render that particular frame. Game thread, this is a C++ as mentioned earlier, blueprint, physics, and etc. Draw thread, CPU render time, GPU render time for GPU, RHIT, or you can just think of it, RHIT is easiest for me. Typically it's R-H-I. Thread time is synced to the frame and it will likely be similar to the frame time. And then R-H-I stands for render hardware interface, if you're wondering. Next we have the Dynarez. It's not supported unless turned on. This helps to optimize things, especially if testing packaging out. So you can actually turn it on if you need to. And if you need to cater a particular export that you need to send things to and say, hey, I want to see what things look like on Windows and on an Android pad or whatever, I forget what their interface is for Android. They have their own interface, which is Android. My bad. So sad that I said that. Such a PC guy and a Mac dude. So we have a prims here, the current amount of triangles being drawn. So all these things are set into place to be able to help you look at your calculations. So to better understand how that works, I have a graphic here that shows you the CPU game, game context. And then next we have the CPU mostly draw what to render. And finally, the GPU brings all these two guys together and gives you our final pixel. So you can kind of think of it that way. And I have another graphic up here, which kind of breaks that down just the same to make it a little bit easier to understand. So in other words, the game three computes the data in the world to know where everything is. The draw thread calculates what is on screen and then what can be called. And the GPU thread is set to draw calls for any meshes that were not called by the draw thread. So the bottleneck you can hit long thread times can create bottlenecks and reduce frame rates. So if you have stuff that's unnecessary that you were bogged down, you're seeing this is the thing you have to think about. If you're coming from a movie background where you're throwing everything at Maya, unreal, you have to be deterministic. You can't throw this chicken and the chicken, the kitchen sink at it because you want to be able to think what is it that you need? What are the hero objects? What is the primary focus? And you have to come in with a game plan and focus on making the higher resolution. They hire Polly for those items and things in the background can take a hit in the texture department. You can merge when you need to. Nobody's interacting with it. And this also goes for games. You just got to think deterministically how you're going to approach things. So you can think of the calling this way. You can see here that it's only unreal, only draws what's in front of it as where that camera is moving. It's not going to, it doesn't draw everything at the same time. It's just an efficient way for unreal to work. Now there are different calling methods and you can turn these in and you can use a calling distance volume if you want to. And we're going to go briefly over that. Not too much in the film department. You don't use it as much. And unreal works pretty well without necessarily needing it, but there will be times where you might need it on a more game centric workflow. We see here we have the view frustum. Calling uses the visible screen area of the camera field of view FOV to call objects not within this space. View frustum is a pyramidal, I got to get that word right, pyramidal shape that includes an ear and far clipping plane, which defines the closest and farthest of any object should be visible within this space. All not in view removed. So it's basically kind of, let me go back to the last slide we talked about. It's again, only going to draw what's in front of that camera or that view. Even as you are working in the editor, if you're just using a perspective camera, it's going to do the same thing, which is super convenient to work with. All right. So there's pre-computed visibility. Now, all these things you can actually adjust in your settings if you need to. And that can be helpful in the cases of lower level hardware. So let's go on to the next one here. There's dynamic occlusion. That my conclusion system is what Unreal is primary working with right now in Unreal four and five and comes with several calling methods to choose from. So you can, again, you can query these, you can change these. I prefer using the defaults. I really, well, rarely ever have to mess with these because Unreal just does a really good job and really relies on you to be efficient with the way that you are making and creating and crafting your scene. So just think efficiency, just think hero objects are the ones that get the most texture, they get the most poly count, they get the most love in your scene, and everything from there can degrade and be lesser. Now we all know that directors, we all know that game heads will actually want those things to change on the fly. Just be prepared to swap them out if needed to prevent bloat. But for the most part, if there's a game plan, a game level design, if there's a game plan for the film, knowing what the objectives are, you're going to be working pretty nicely with the system in place. You can see here kind of how it works and how the camera frustum is shown here and you can actually see it. Now this in previous versions of Unreal doesn't always show up to the party. So if you find in 5.3 doesn't quite show up, don't worry about it. It's just a demonstration of what that view is as it increases. I found in earlier versions of Unreal, this wouldn't always show up and wouldn't always update as you changed that frustum. So we're going to go and take a look at some profiling, some quick tools to be able to profile and see what's going on in your scene. This includes the profile GPU. Let's go to Unreal to see that up close and I'll point out a few things. So in Unreal, we're going to go and activate profile GPU. I'm going to hit enter. You'll see it pop up. Mine kind of went off screen. Let me pull it over for you so you guys can take a look. So what is happening here is Unreal's taking a snapshot just for a brief moment of my scene and where I'm at. I do recommend if you are going to use this tool to make sure that you create a bookmark of the areas that you want to analyze for that brief moment. This snapshot here you can save if you need to and it will allow you to go in here and you can analyze each one of your frames and see what might be giving you some trouble. The yellow areas are going to be where the most trouble we're going to have. Now we don't have a lot of fog in here but if we had fog, oh looks like I moved some things, if we had fog it would be a bit or at least had it heavier. That would be the bigger draw call or issue we may run into. I can do a quick search if I wanted to in my scene for exponential height fog and I can see for that brief second what my milliseconds were giving me overall. You'll see that it took a snapshot here. It's just a couple seconds here and you can again how the bar works is it takes those scene elements and it gives you a computed breakdown color coding where your trouble may be. So let's actually go and look at this a bit closer in our slides and we're going to go and look at a few other ways to do profiling. Now again you don't have to use this method. This is just one of many because it tells you right here in our track here what duration, what milliseconds took up the most time to calculate and then you can find out, oh I can see where my issues may have occurred and in this case it's the ray tracing dynamic update. We can open it up further and we can see where those issues may have occurred. Now you can collapse these at any time but you'll notice then the build here is a ray tracing dynamic geometry update here and this took up the most time. Basically we have a lot of geo in here so if we needed to we could do a bit more merging if we needed and even use some cards for some of our land items. They don't have to be full on nanite geometry. All right let's go back into the slides. So again the profile gpu command allows you to quickly identify the gpu cost of the various passes sometimes down to the draw calls. The data is based on gpu timestamps and is usually quite accurate. Certain optimizations can make the numbers less reliable and it is good to be critical about any number. So in other words I wouldn't just use it by itself. It's great for a quick look where the trouble is at but you definitely want to look at such things as insights and a few other things I'm going to show you to analyze things overall. Drivers tend to optimize shader cost a few seconds after using the shader. This can be noticeable and it might be useful to wait a bit or measure another time to get more confidence. So again the snapshot is a disadvantage here because you might want to compare a couple of snapshots together to see what you're getting and this is why I emphasize maybe using other ones on top of this because it's good for a quick look but necessarily not necessarily for a deep dive on what's going on. So overall how to use it. We again we place the camera we made sure that we bookmarked it. We ran gpu a profile gpu. We type that in the command line and it gives us a snapshot of what's going on and again good to bookmark like I mentioned before. Floating your cursor over the largest of the recorded bars shows you what is taking up the most hits. Again this larger bar here and it looks like again this larger bar here and it looks like it's going to be our fog. I did say the color before it's mainly the larger bar versus the color and in this case it's the volume metrics. So in this case it definitely is hitting a bit more. As you can see you can do a comparable as I move around you can see our our sections or seconds here milliseconds and you'll see that 1.15 in this particular case is eating up the most time. And again clicking on it gives you the duration time to the process listed below. So let's go ahead and take a look at another one called stat gpu. This is going to give us a nice overview. It gives us like an overlay and milliseconds showing us what's eating up most of our gpu processing time in calculation and it will give us the minutes, the min, the max, and the overall average and then you can actually get a quick real-time response and see what is going on. Now you can run the stat space gpu or you can simply go to stats advanced and you'll go all the way down to gpu here on the bottom. Let's go and take a look at it in unreal. So I'm going to go to my output log. I'm going to type in stats space gpu. Sometimes it might take a little bit of time to come up. You can now see here it is calculating for us letting us know what's eating up the most of our time. We have our space probes there just sitting there waiting for our information. As we move around you can test and see what those calculations are. Pretty nice to be able to have that. You can say oh you know what I am noticing that things are a little bit heavier here when it comes to our lumenscene probe gathering. And I think a little bit heavier here when it comes to our volumetric clouds maybe a bit. So that gives you a quick rundown of things. I go to my output log here. I'm going to hit my up arrow and we're going to turn that sucker off and it's simply just inputting that one more time. And I'll just hit enter. There we go. That's it with this one. In the next video we're going to take a look at cpu draw threads and we're going to look at unreal insights. Thanks again.",
