  "text": " In this section, let's continue our final recommendations with a brief discussion about workspace layouts. The first thing that I need to point out is that your workspace layout is entirely up to the user. With that established, we do have some recommended layouts for specific tasks and hardware configurations. Our first recommended layout is for single monitor users doing sequencer editorial, assemblies, or layout. The position of your menu tabs is fully customizable, but it is highly recommended that you work using a split view in your viewport. Now let's jump into the engine and change our layout. We'll begin changing our layout by moving into our viewport, going up to the three lines in a circle in the upper left hand corner. And these are our viewport options. From here, I'm going to move down to the layout section and change from one pane to two panes side by side. From there, I'm going to make sure that both of the views are set to perspective and that one of the views is set to the default viewport. I'm also going to move back over to make sure that this viewport, my default viewport, does not allow for cinematic control. If I move over to my other view, I'm going to make sure that this one is set to my cinematic viewport and my second view does allow for cinematic control. The reason for that is so that if I activate my viewport's camera cuts and lock my camera to that cut, it's going to allow me to pass through and view what's happening within my cinematic viewport and still be able to move around and adjust what's going on inside my default viewport without any interaction of what's happening inside that viewport. Once you have all that set with your layouts, you can save your layout. All you need to do that is simply go up to the window, move down to the save layout section and save your layout as. Once you have a saved layout, you can load any layout by moving over to the load layouts and load any of the default layouts or user saved layout that you have created. You can also import any saved layout that you have exported and shared with other users. Let's jump back into the slides and look at one more hardware dependent option. This is an example of a layout using concurrent editorial and animation setup for users that have a dual monitor or ultra wide monitor hardware configuration. Once again, I want to emphasize that your workspace layout is entirely customizable so that it can meet the individual user needs or preferences and any workspace layout you create can be shared among other users once it's saved. Finally, I do want to remind users that on occasion you might run into a bug when switching back and forth between saved layouts that will cause the engine to crash. So just be careful with layout switching for now. That's it for this section. In our next section, we will continue with a few more of our final recommendations.",
