  "text": " Now that we know what Twinmotion is and who can use it, now we need to actually install it. So what do we do first? Let's go through that. What do we first? Now the first thing we need to do is we need to make sure that we have an Epic Games account. So you have it signed up. If you haven't done that already, you can refer back to our intro to Unreal, which will discuss how to activate your Epic Games account. We're going to go as if you already have it activated, and we're just going to make sure that we download the Epic Games launcher. There are a couple of ways that you can actually install Twinmotion, but we're going to use the method of Epic Games launcher. So once we have that downloaded, let's launch the Epic Games launcher, and it will look something like this. And you're going to take a look and you'll see the overall catalog, but we're more concerned right now with the Twinmotion aspect. So if you click into Twinmotion, you should see this. More than likely at first you will see the Please Wait if you've installed it for the first time. Once it is available, you have options available to you as far as which version from a dropdown. We're going to be using the 2025.1.1, and we'll be running that. Now, once it is available, we're going to go ahead and launch it. So just go ahead and press the launch, and we will in our next portion, we will go over the templates that are available and start using Twinmotion and getting used to it. When you first open up Twinmotion, what you're going to see is this home screen. Now, this gives you all the updated news, anything that's available, the latest of what's happened, as well as some community sizzle rails. Down here, you'll see some of your recent scenes if you have run them. Now, you will notice this little red, almost broken links. That's exactly what it is. That just means that you either moved your project or deleted it, and this will give you a nice little alert, as you can see missing files. So we're going to ignore all this for now. But right next to it is the templates rather below. If you click on templates, give it a second. Sometimes it doesn't like to respond.",
