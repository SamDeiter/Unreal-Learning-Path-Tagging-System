  "text": " Alright, in this section we're going to look at Sequencer's features and tools. And this might be a bit of a review for some of you. So if you've already had the Quick Start Sequencer Shot Creation course, we'll start a review with the Sequencer features. Naturally, the first feature we're going to look at is the most important. And that's the Sequencer user interface. Now I've broken this down into four primary sections that you can look at and reference within this image. Feel free to pause or take a screenshot for reference later. But let's jump into the engine and really explore the Sequencer user interface. Now in order to view the Sequencer user interface, we're going to need an active level sequence. To locate that, go into the Content Browser, find the seq10502 folder, move through the course topics, and locate the Sequencer short example folder. Inside that folder you'll find an seqfilm level sequence example. Double click on that and that will launch the Sequencer user interface. Now the first stop is the toolbar. That is marked as section 1 on the slides. And from the toolbar we can do things such as add a cine camera and camera cuts track, adjust our frame rate, set automatic keyframes, adjust snapping options, activate our render options, save our level sequence, and activate our Sequencer curves editor. Over to the right side of the toolbar, we can use the breadcrumb section to quickly navigate between nested level sequences. The best way to do that is to double click onto whatever shot you want to navigate into and make changes. Once you're done working, you simply finish, save, and then use your breadcrumbs to navigate back to the top level sequence in your level sequence containers. Over to what we have marked as section 2 in the slides is our Sequencer outliner. This is where we can add or filter any tracks that we can use inside the Event Manager, which works to manage any of our shots, animations, characters, blueprints, fade tracks, groups, scenes, and material parameter collections. To the right of our Event Manager is our Timeline. And I've separated this out from the Event Manager as section number 3 in the slide deck because there is quite a bit that can be done here. This is where our playhead is located. It is right at the top of our Timeline and it is the red arrow that you can use to scrub through the Timeline and its placement does impact where your edits and connections are made. The Timeline also provides you access to the Tracks area where you can actually see what is being worked on or is active. This is where any event triggers, animation tracks, control rigs, camera translations, or rotation movement, or any exposed parameters can be keyframed and animated. That leaves us with the final area, which is marked as section 4 on the slides, and that is our playback controls. This is where our time range slider is adjusted and is also where we can do things like play, move between frames, and loop playback as needed. Here we can also record using Take Recorder that is integrated into Sequencer. Now I just want to emphasize that Sequencer is an event manager and can be used to trigger events in games or manage any kind of action exposed to Sequencer inside the level sequence that you are working on. Additionally, while I opened the level Sequencer and navigated over to the Sequencer Curves Editor, I want to reiterate that this feature allows you to adjust keyframes and curves as you are going through and animating or moving things around inside the engine and that Sequencer works with Take Recorder, Cinematic Assets, Blueprints, Niagara, Control Rig, Composure, and Material parameters that can be modified using the Sequencer Curves Editor. Finally, Sequencer also has some project templates that you can work from and in some of our courses there may be various options that you will be using in training or to start your own projects. That can be any of the film and video live event templates, any of the game templates, or any other template options in the project browser that I recommend you go through and play with in order to best see which one of the templates might fit your project needs. Once you've started your project, there is also a template for Sequencer that is called a Level Sequence with Shots. This is a good template to start with that can be accessed directly from the main engine toolbar. It will allow you to quickly create several shots and it is quite helpful if you already know how many shots you need before you start your shot creation. Just be aware that this is a uniform shot creation template, so any settings established from this template will carry over to each shot that is made. That means you'll most likely have to go back and alter each of these shots once they're created. Now let's take a look at how that's done. Now first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to dock my Sequencer over to the right of my Content Browser. That gives me a better Sequencer interface to use from and it's keeping things out of the way. But in order to build a Level Sequence with Shots, I move up to the main toolbar and I can choose to add a Level Sequence with Shots. That brings up my template and I can add in a pre-existing Level Sequence to duplicate it if I would like. Again, everything is uniform, everything is named the same way, it all has the same duration, you will have to modify it. Another way to create a Level Sequence is to simply go in and add a Level Sequence. That allows you to choose a folder, name your sequence and create a brand new one. However, I think there's an easier and better way that I use instead. Now a lot of Level Sequences are stored in folders for organization, but I'm going to show you how to create a Level Sequence really quickly inside the Content Browser. Simply right-click, move up to the Cinematic section and choose Level Sequence. Rename that SEQEX for my example and hit Enter. That gives me access to my Level Sequence. Now if I have a Level Sequence that has information in it already and I want to just make alterations within that and make creative decisions and edits, I just go ahead and hit Ctrl D. That duplicates that and allows me to create a new version instantly. So that is my preferred way to create that and you may find a different way that you prefer as well. That's it for this section of Sequencer's features. In our next section, we will explore a few of Sequencer's tools.",
