  "text": " We'll be using a different shader ball and diving into it. This one over here closest to us. This looks like a layered material. If I hold down the F key to focus on it and we look at it, it's shiny and wood and gold and it's got a parquet floor and gold flecks. And it's a peculiar material actually in a way. If this is going to be your floor material, do you want gold on it? I don't know. It's definitely interesting. And in the details for it, if we look at it up close by double click on it, double clicking And again, we can use the magnifying glass to locate it in the materials. I'm sorry, in the content browser. We can open it by double clicking on it in either place. And we can see how it's constructed. And this is the finished version of it, which you could move to a second monitor to study it as we build it. We're going to build this. And this is really cool because this is not this looks like a layered material, but it isn't. We're just using masking and we're creating the illusion of it being a layered material by using masking. But masking is a lot cheaper than layering. Layering has far more draw calls. It uses up far more resources and masking. Masking is just selective application of texture maps to a surface and really useful, really helpful. So to create this, we'll go to our content browser and right clicking and going to material. We'll call this material. We'll call it M underscore for material. Using the Allard standard mentioned in an earlier lecture, we'll call it Goldwood floor. Enter. And we'll double click to open it. Now for this material, we'll need a bunch of textures, including some that we've made ourselves for the masking. To find those textures, these the textures in use here, we can go to our sample and locate the textures. We'll need the wooden floor textures. So the albedo textures. Part a floor. Once it's selected in the texture sample, the details where we can swap out the texture also have the magnifying glass that help us find the materials. And we'll need all of these in our material. So if we go back to our empty material editor, where we'll be creating the material, we can select all of these by control clicking on them. And then with any one of them selected, left click and drag them into the material editor. So those are our wood textures. Additionally, we'll need our gold textures. For gold, we'll be using Megascans gold. So in the content browser, there's a Megascans folder. And if we begin to open that, there are surfaces and we can open the surfaces and we can locate gold among them. And here we see we have many of their gold. The many maps they use for gold. And we won't be using all of them, but we'll be using a lot of them. So now we'll be using the albedo, normal, roughness, specular. We won't actually be using specular, but metal. We won't be using specular directly, but I want to point something out about it. So we'll be dragging it in as if we're using it. Let's see. Here we got roughness. And that should be it, I think. Seems right. And with each of those controls selected, we'll be dragging those into our material editor window. Let's see, is there anything, is there anyone I've left out? I don't think so. Okay, cool. We'll drag these off and we'll drag these off. Whoops. We'll drag all of those around to a different place so we can start to sort them out. So for our gold, I'll click elsewhere to deselect, elsewhere on the grid, and pull the gold albedo up. And we will want to mask it, filter it through a map. And this will be the map that we use that has diamonds and a surrounding white area to create these lines and diamonds of gold. And we'll be filtering these, filtering the gold through this map. And to get it to show up in the diamond areas, we'll need to invert the values of this map. And so we'll use the 1 minus or minus 1 by holding down the O key and in the grid, clicking on the grid to get the 1 minus. And we'll pipe the RDB values into the 1 minus. And to see what the result is, we can use in the 1 minus node, this little down arrow to the top right. And by clicking on that, it will display the result of what information it has received. And we'll take that and we'll feed the gold albedo and this inverted mask into a multiply. So hold down the M key and left click. And we'll take the albedo RGB, feed it into the A and the result of the 1 minus, pipe it into the B. And then we'll introduce our, the other part of our masked map, the albedo of the wood floor, the parquet floor. Let's make some more room, move stuff over. And feed this into an ad. So we'll hold down the A key for add and left click and get an ad. And we'll take the result of the multiply and feed it into the A of the ad. And feed the RGB of the texture into the B. And there's another concept I want to introduce here, which we're not actually going to be using to any real effect here. I just want to, I want to introduce it as an idea that you can use another node that you can use for adjusting how your materials will be interpreted as they go to the result node. And it's also a way, and this is what I want to get at for introducing it here, a way of indicating to people downstream from you, who will be looking at and using your materials, that there are certain parts of the materials that you don't want to have adjusted or changed. And to do that, we'll use something called a clamp. So if you left click to bring up the search bar and type in clamp, we'll get this node called a clamp. And this can be really good just for setting absolute minimums absolute maximums. We won't be using it that way. We'll just be bringing the value, the output from the ad, and just feeding it through the clamp. Just, we're just using it as a way of indicating to people who may be including your material say in a blueprint, or another part of the project. That this is something that they should look at twice before they make changes to it. And so, actually with it without the clamp. We get the same result because we're not actually using it. And we're getting our masked floor. There's no shininess or metal this to it yet, because we haven't introduced those ideas. This is really just the basic albedo. So again a clamp, good idea to signal the say seriousness of the material that you've created. So I'm just doubling this up a little bit. And these are working, by the way, multiply and add in a fashion similar to Photoshop so you would get the same sort of masked masking results at a Photoshop.",
