  "text": " So now we have the door working. The final thing that we need to do is create a button, which can be used in order to lock or unlock the door. This gives us an opportunity to look at communication between two different actors and how we might go about setting that up. So let's create a new factor. So to do that I'm going to watch and click in the Content Browser and I'm going to go up and create a new Blueprint class. Again, I'm going to select from an actor and I'm going to call this BP underscore button. I'm going to double click to open it up. Now in this I will want a couple of things, a couple of components. I'm going to start with a static mesh. Static mesh component. I'm going to call this button mesh. And in this I'm going to search for corner and that should bring up the SM underscore corner frame. So this is just a non-descript static mesh that we can use in this case as a button. OK, now we're going to want to push this button in the same way that we do with the E key. So I'm going to add in a collision. So I'm going to type in box, box collision. I'm going to want to take this and scale it up so that it fits comfortably in front of the mesh. OK, that should give us enough space. Now again, like we did last time, I'm going to need two events, the on-component begin overlap and the on-component end overlap. Jump in. And rather than rewriting all the code itself, I'm going to jump into the BP door. And I am going to highlight these three sections of the code and I'll down control and add in another. So I've got these sections. So I've got the enable input and the player controller and the E key. I'm going to press control C, jump across to the blueprints and press control V. Down and connect these up. So we straight away got most of the code that we need here. Now, when we press the E key, we don't actually want to be running code on the BP underscore button. We want to be running code on the BP underscore door. In order to do that, we're going to need a means of defining which doors belong to which buttons. And we'll do that by using a variable. So if you come down into the variables and press plus, I'm going to call this connected doors. And I'm going to hit the button for instance as well. I don't want to be able to set this per instance. And now for variable type, I'm going to do a drop down and I am going to search for BP underscore door. And when I scroll over, you'll see the left knob, an option for object reference. And this is what I'm going to select. There's one more thing that I'm going to do. I want to be able to add more than one door to a button. So to do this, rather than having a singular door reference, I'm going to do a drop down box and select an array. So an array is just going to change this variable to rather than one single variable. It's going to be a list of doors that we can add multiple entries in. So to work with this, I'm going to drag the connected doors in. I'm going to change to a get. I'm going to then drag off of the connected doors. And I'm going to look for a for loop. A for each loop to be exact. I'm going to connect that up to the execution. The way for each works is if you provide it with an array, it will trigger the loop body once for each actor, which is inside this array. So this allows us to go through and perform an action for each actor. Right. Now that we have a link to the actor here, I'm going to want to start. I'm going to want to do one thing, and that is change the step, the boolean for is locked. So if it is locked, I'm going to it will be true. I don't want to change it to false. If it's false, I want to change it to true. So I'm going to drag off. First thing I need to do is query it. I'm going to do get locked. And that will give me get is locked. And I'm also going to want to set. So I'll type set locked and go set is locked. Next to that up. Now, I want to reverse this value. So I'm going to drag off and I'm going to search for. So this is going to this is going to reverse it. If it's true, it will return false. If it is false, it will return true. So this is great. What we've got here is we are changing the we're changing the boolean. We're toggling the boolean. Now, there's one more thing that I'd like to do, and that is update the lights, because that way we can see if the light if the door is locked or is unlocked. So I'm going to drag off and I'm going to search for update light. And this is the function that we created. And this is a great example of why creating code in functions is a really good way to do something, because this will this is then we can call this and we can run this at any point. Any point that we want to make sure the lights are updated. We can just run this function without having to go away or write the appropriate code. So we have quite a simple straightforward script here for each connected door. We are going to swap the variable or swap the variable over. So it's true to false, false to true. And then we're going to update the lights. So let's see this in action. And hit compile and save. Right, so I'm going to grab my BP dot button and drag it into the world. Shift it up and rotate it. I'm going to push it back a bit to make sure that it doesn't overlap with the player start. Now, with this button, you can see with it selected, we have connected doors as a as an input in the details. Now I want to go on to connect this to both the doors. So I'm going to push push it twice to create two. And you'll see now we have two entries in this array. Now I could do a drop down, which would allow me to select a door in the level manually. But also I have next to it a perpent. Now, if I click on that, it's not going to let me click on anything until I'm overlapping the specific class, which it is. You can see here the BP, the PIC BP underscore door. I'm going to have that as my first entry and this is my second entry. Right. So now it's time to test it out. So if I jump into the level, walk up to my sling and my PYDOTA, you can see when I push the button, it is flicking between the two separate doors. And we should now be able to see that the left hand door will open and the right hand door won't. So it looks like a relatively simple example. But with this, we would be able to create numerous buttons and numerous doors with overlapping functionality. So you'd easily be able to create some kind of puzzle maze or something. But it goes as a simple example of how we're going to animate an actor and we can go away and control and control settings from an external. Great. Now, one last thing before we finish. Something that we haven't done to this point is looked at commenting. Now, commenting is an important part of coding if you want to make sure that other people can understand what you've created. It goes alongside good naming conventions for variables and functions. I haven't shown how to do that yet. So, for example, I wanted to comment this here because this is the opening and the closing of the door. Let me left hand click. So I select all of them and then just by pressing the C key, I can make a comment. Update door mesh rotation over time. OK, so it's a simple a simple comment here. There are also some settings that can come in here. But if I double click, my thing is I can change the color. And this is really useful because you can see now from what can be just a pile of spaghetti with lots and lots of things connected. You can now make a bit more sense out of out of what's going on in this case. Great. So that is you just need to highlight something and press the C button. So bluetree prints and its functionality are all over Unreal Engine. There's there's very there's not much of the engine which which can't be controlled or sort of like added to functionality wise by just knowing a little bit of blueprints. So thank you for sticking with this tutorial. I hope you've got some value out of it. It should act as a good foundation if you want to go into learning more complicated blueprints. You.",
