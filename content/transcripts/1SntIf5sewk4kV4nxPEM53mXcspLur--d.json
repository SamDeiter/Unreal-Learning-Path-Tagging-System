  "text": " So what is ray tracing? So rasterization is typically utilized here and objects in a scene are created by a virtual mesh of triangles, hence the baking method. Looking at every object shape, material relationship, it's written to the G buffer and lighting reads the per pixel properties and then performs some kind of lighting with them. So in the bottom image here you can see the polygons on the screen there and then the amount of rasterized pixels within that polygon range. So a ray trace relies on a system of bounding photons from the object to object before reaching the camera to produce some kind of image. So we can see the camera here, we can see some kind of light source and then the actual desired object. The ray is actually coming from the camera's perspective and then the bounce based on the vector that you're looking at this object from is from the light angle there. And to set ray tracing up in your project, you first want to go to the project settings. So you can just go to edit at the top of your Unreal Engine and go to project settings. And then in the engine rendering tab, we want to first of all turn on support for the hardware ray tracing there. We want the ray trace shadows, we want to get the skylight involved as well and then the texture LOD which is optional for optimization. Under the platform section you want to go to Windows and set the default RHI to DX12 and then the SM6 is optional, which is primarily used for lumen. We want to make sure support compute skin cache is enabled and then an optional feature is the modeling mode which enables ray tracing while editing and then new mesh objects enable ray tracing. And if we want to dial in some quality settings still within the project settings, we can change the GBruffer format to the high precision normal. We can change reflection methods standalone ray traced and then we can also set the reflection capture quality to 1024 or 2048. So 2048 only really if needed. Of course, it's double the impact. So you just want to dial that into whatever your project specific needs are. And then it helps if using a combination of both ray tracing for as a fallback method there. And then lastly, you just want to make sure your normals are high resolution for key areas and items, which would be hero actors in your scene to prevent any kind of sorting issues. So that can be done in the per mesh instance on the details panel. And then in our material graphs, we want to replace some of the ray tracing nodes here. So we want to use this node to replace an entire part of our material logic essentially to lower the cost of features such as RTGI, the ray trace reflections, the translucency with less complex logic. So this is a global change that affects all ray tracing effects. And in this example, you can see that the normal logic path renders as seen in the scene and then the ray tracing path uses less complex logic for effects and ray tracing. So you get the RTGI, real time global illumination and reflections where textures, normals and roughness can become expensive. It can be an expensive added cost essentially. So a quick note here that the path tracer quality switch, which we'll be talking about path tracer in a little while here, but the quality switch replace can be now used instead of RT. So if you go into the path tracer from the ray trace, you won't have to adjust your materials to compensate since they are being handled differently. And a cool thing we can also do in our materials is to create a material switch parameter. So we can create a material switch parameter using the static switch parameter that can be used on a shot by shot basis. So it allows us to switch off any of the unneeded or heavy aspects of material, swapping out textures for scale parameters with no texture values. So quick note there is that you always want to keep material simple if you can, less roughness, less rough detail since these cost. So unless you're not working in games and not worried about a frame rate, such as with film or you just need high quality final pixels or just some aspects of virtual production, you can consider those things when creating your materials. And then looking at the lights and properties when it comes to ray tracing, the light type that works well with ray tracing is the rec light. So similar to Meyers on Max's area light, each light can then be used for ray tracing, but the rec light has really nice control for the shadows, which we can see settings for in other courses in this series if you want to dig into rec light properties. But all lights must be set to movable for ray tracing and that be active in the light so that you can also control in the light under the ray tracing samples per pixel to really dial in the shadow control there. And it's not always needed, but you can help with a shadow quality as well. So typically a setting of one works pretty well, but higher can be expensive and not necessarily always needed. So again, it's very project specific, depends what the final outcome is. And if you're working at runtime or you can pre-bake or pre-render anything, you've just got to think of those properties in that respect. So to get some softer shadows for the different variety of lights in a spotlight, we can control the source radius to control that softness. In the point light, it would be the control source radius, which is the low hard shadows or the soft, the highest soft shadows, sorry. And then in the rec light, we've got the band door that tries to simulate cinematic lights, which is sampled per pixel. In the directional light, the source angle can soften the light. And then using the skylight, set the source to the SLS captured scene or the SLS specific cube map. By default, raytrace is off due to the cost and calculating. And you can select the BP sky in the level to see that connected and just know that there is a high expense with that approach. And when using a rec light, we also are able to add a source texture to the light that you can see in this screenshot here. And using textures will really help push realism in a light. It allows you to get maybe a softer fall off or something that you want to do to manipulate how the light is presented in the world. So it'll help with light reflections to mimic its intended real world space. And the spec may at times have to be tweaked if the actual physical shape of the light persists. We can also control raytracing properties in the post-process volume settings. So global illumination, you want to change the method to standalone raytracing the post-process volume. Maybe deprecated in name only, but it will be around for a bit. Is it great for visuals for final pixel? And it's not been fully absorbed by other methods yet. We also have the raytrace global illumination, referred to as RTGI. It's used to control that global illumination. And you can choose the quality final gather versus a brute force. So brute force for better quality, but it is heavy on that GPU. We can do raytrace reflections, which have higher max bounces and samples per pixel for the best results. The samples and bounces can really help a scene, but they can be costly. So you want to set your raytrace reflections from shadows to area. We've also got the raytracing AO, which is ambient occlusion. And it really allows for those high quality shadows. We've got translucency, but it can be costly. So raytrace can be hard on the more than one translucent object in the scene and keep track of how many you have and have that material set up correctly. So it's not too costly for what you need. We also have the raytracing translucency, which allows for greater control and max bounce and refractions can make things more realistic. But again, it can come at a cost. So in RT mode, like last refraction, it's not possible, but it does have soft shadows now. So again, just check the engine version that you're using. Some of these features will get updated as we go. So just it's worth keeping in mind the raytracing translucency and what the options are there, depending on the engine version that you're using. If we're really trying to dial in the realism of our raytracing, reflection quality is key here. So we have a few settings that we can dial in to emphasize the reflection quality. We've got the number of bounces. These are key to try and keep, but like keep them to one to two range to prevent any performance hits. You've got the samples per pixel, which can also help keep the range quite low at first. Again, you can dial these up depending on the final outcome and the platform that you're targeting. We've got shadows, which currently have hard shadow option in this area. And then it's also worth noting that max roughness should be reduced to increase performance if needed. Some more settings we can change when it comes to reflection quality. For even stronger reflections in the geo of the object, you can check LOD zero and use a high precision tangent basis, then hit apply changes. This can help clear up reflections for believability with less distortion. A couple of notes here that FBX will have it off. So anything you import will be off by default and Datasmith imported objects should already have it turned on. So again, just check your FBX pipeline to see what the settings are there by default. And if you're having any issues with your raytracing, how to edit them and troubleshoot them, here are a few notes here. So we want to make sure that all lights that are meant for raytracing to be movable. If they're static, raytracing isn't going to be calculated there. So each light should be set to cast raytracing shadows by default. Skylight does not currently have this on, as we mentioned in a previous slide. And just make a note of that in case you do want to change that at a later date. Console commands can also be used in blueprints to help optimize visuals such as raytrace reflections, max distance and toggling features on and off, for example. So you can find a whole host of raytracing console commands in the documentation. And if you set up key inputs or you just want to open the console commander runtime using the tilde key, you can enter some of these console commands and just see exactly what impacts that will have on the results. And then when you dial in these options, you can then set them as the default configurations for your projects when loading them up. You can also include higher bounces that can help with noise, but be careful here because it can help some areas and cause pixelation and others depending on materials. So you can also try setting the raytrace reflection captures to one that can be used to fake a second bounce. So that's a nice little tip if you want to really help get those higher bounces, but just be careful of the noise there. And if you're wanting raytrace global illumination, it's worth considering some of the following points. So we've got geometry with small holes or lots of little details can impact performance, such as foliage and fences. We also on indoor environments are slower to perform than outdoor areas. So when a light enters from outside areas that are directly lit, it's faster than points that are indirectly lit. And also, you have to consider that more raytracing features are being used, such as reflections and translucency. So everything will stack on top of each other. So it's up to you whether you're wanting to load your own raytracing features or not. So everything will stack on top of each other. So it's up to you whether you're wanting to look at translucency or reflections or if you want this real time, a global illumination that is raytraced. All these features will come with a separate cost and it's worth trying to balance what outcome you want. So you can also turn off the raytrace global illumination and use some screen space global illumination with raytrace reflections. This will greatly increase performance if frame rates are slow using the raytrace global illumination there. When we're trying to balance between combining the kind of quality versus performance tradeoffs here, you can help with performance by using this console command. It traces significantly less, set it to maybe 25 or 50. If 25 is blurry, that may help with some performance issues there. Enabling material sorting may improve the cost of shading the reflected surfaces as well. So material sorting sorts reflection shading work by the material coherence. And this comes with some overhead. So material shading is only a win when shading coherence is a limiter. So gains of 50% or more are not uncommon with this feature. So maybe using this console command might help your project. And it's also used to create a hybrid raytrace looking at reflections baked, making it easier on bounces after a particular distance. So it will go to screen space after that distance. So set it to one or zero when being on. So you can use that console for that. And then also raytrace reflections are expensive as we've been discussing. So these can be managed using reflection actors as reflection actors, sorry, as the last bounce in the raytrace reflection. So it's worth considering that console command as well. So some additional commands that can help the visuals that you can link to a blueprint. If materials are not rendering correctly, try these CVars to evaluate the skylight correctly. And then also to test the effect of your materials, you can use that console command. And then this next command can be helpful, but it's best to pick a walkthrough of your effects or turning them all on. The alternative is to turn them all off. So minus one will use a previous settings enable for your project, which is a handy little tip. And then you want to turn on all raytrace visuals. So tread with caution here and then just you can use that console command if you want for your projects. And then with optimizing our scene, we can reduce the number of bounces and it can make this the scene a smoother frame. But it's not necessarily going to affect the visuals as well. So translucent materials are going to be expensive in general. So if you can see this image here, setting the bounce to one or two or three will give it some GPU cost in terms of the milliseconds that you can see ramping up almost double in some instances. So you just want to balance that number depending on the number of bounces you want for your given scene. And also an important note at the bottom there is if a card is timing out, there's some documentation to kind of debug that issue for you. We can also optimize our light editing and samples. So a skylight resolution control set the resolution to 1024 and each light has raytraced samples per pixel. So if you dial it up based on the scene or the level that you're working in and the images you are using, keep it low at first and then dial it up. That should give you some good results there. And then you can also balance the performance versus the visual fidelity and lack of noise. So again, it's going to be that trade off. And the higher your raytracing samples are in the light, the slower the performance is going to be. So number one is a good start. Higher might have limited results. So again, it's just testing out and if you're setting up blueprints for these different variables and you're trying out and you can even set up a console to take a screenshot, for example. So when you're trying out the different samples, it's worth taking screenshots as well for each sample that you change so that then you can compare and contrast what is giving you the best results. So you can start with a final gather settings, max bounce of four and samples per pixel 16. And then for the best quality results using brute force will come at a lower frame rate. So there's a higher cost there. But to reduce the reflection noise for both or you can speed up the frame at a visual cost. So the raytraced reflections samples per pixel are the properties that you want to really dial in there. Lastly, we can use a final gather. It's currently based on a world distance measured from the original shading point. So this rejection criteria defaults to 10 units. So in these raytraced global illumination settings, we've got this final gather. We've got our max bounce set to one, our samples per pixel to 16. And then any additional max bounces beyond one are silently discarded when adjusting the samples per pixel. So it's best to increase it by powers of two. So you may go 8, 16, 64, etc. And to aid in suppressing temporal ghosting artifacts, you can use the following commands to modify the world space rejection criteria using that CVAR below. These slides were created by Sean Spitzer today. And then you can find the additional documentation page on the hardware raytracing tips and tricks on the Unreal Engine documentation site.",
