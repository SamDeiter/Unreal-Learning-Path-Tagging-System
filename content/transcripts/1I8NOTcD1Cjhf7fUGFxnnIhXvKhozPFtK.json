  "text": " Starting off with construction scripts, what are construction scripts, what are they good for and where to find them? So you can find the construction script if you see this little header here inside the blueprint graph, you can see construction script and so you can run any kind of construction script from this window. So if you're familiar with the blueprint window, you may have come across that heading before. And so construction scripts are used to extend a row of meshes in this instance from the axis pivot point to a specific end point. And that is what this little script is running here. And the good thing about this script is that it runs at editor time. So whenever you're interacting with a blueprint, for example, you can have it so that every time you move the blueprint or change a variable in the blueprint, the construction script fires and updates. So in this instance, we're creating a series of meshes along a point, but also just a basic example would be if we just skip ahead, it would be a construction script that if you just have a print string on a construction script and say construction script is working, you can move this actor around and that will fire every time you move it. So there's a very straightforward way of just showing that if I have an empty actor that just has a construction script with a print string there, you can see that the construction script is trying to do something in this instance of print string and that will end it to cause it to fire every time the blueprint is moved. So then just coming back into how they may be different from the event graph. So the event graph runs during gameplay, which includes a play in editor. So event graph will generally house all your main gameplay functionality. You may be checking for collision and damages, maybe something to do with the player movement or interaction. We have events that fire out of the event graph and we can also spawn actors in the event graph at runtime. So they're all common functionalities of the event graph that maybe you're already familiar with. The construction script, however, runs before the project is running and also whilst in editor, which gives us some really powerful functionality, especially when it comes to creating editor tools, which is what we're looking at today. So in the construction script, we can add components, which is what you saw in the fence example just previously. And then also we can talk about changing parameters and assigning asset references. So to get started today, let's open an empty project. We're just going to create a blank project, but we will include the starter content for today's example. And then we'll begin making some tools.",
