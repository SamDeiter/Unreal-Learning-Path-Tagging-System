  "text": " Okay, so now that we've talked about Lumen, it's time for us to talk about Lightmass and Lightmaps. Lightmass being the offline rendering global illumination system as opposed to Lumen's dynamic global illumination system. So what we're going to cover. What is Lightmass? The best setting for Lightmass, what the Lightmass importance volume is, how to create lightmaps and change in the solver quality. So let's take a look at this. So what's Lightmass? It's an offline global illumination renderer. It basically costs virtually zero at runtime since it's all pre-baked and pre-calculated, so you don't have to calculate anything at runtime. The building process does get longer as your scene becomes more and more complex and Lightmass itself is built using the swarm agent, which allows you to connect multiple PCs if you wanted to, for example, to build the lighting together. To adjust the lightmass settings at the actor level or you can adjust them globally in the world settings panel. Now this is really important. Nanite, the high resolution mesh system for Unreal, is made for Lumen and not Lightmass. So make sure you do turn it off at the project level and that using shadow maps for the shadow map method. If you don't do this, essentially you could be baking or crashing forever. So when it comes to the lightmass and light map settings, the settings that you want to change to get the best quality inside of the world settings are the following. So you can change your static lighting level scale to 1, the number of indirect or sky bounces to 3 between 3 and 10, so again the higher the number the better the quality, however the longer the baking time. The indirect lighting quality to between 1 and 4 and the indirect lighting smoothness between 1 and 1.3. Make sure you if you want the highest quality disabled, compress lightmaps which improves quality but decreases the lightmap size by a factor of 4. So that's something to keep in mind. So when it comes to lightmass and using it properly, one important feature of this or limitation in a way is the lightmass importance volume. It's a volume that focuses the detailed indirect lighting coming from lightmass. So this will help you reduce your lighting times because the important calculations were made only within this volume. So you can use it to determine an area of importance. You get detailed global illumination, it will be restricted in that area based on the settings that you give the lightmass importance volume and any area outside of the importance volume will only get low quality global illumination or one bounce essentially. When it comes to lightmap UVs, when you create a mesh that's going to be lit using the static lighting system in Unreal, you need to create a lightmap which is a new UV map that will essentially be used to store, which will have the lighting texture projected onto it. Why are they important? You need them to create believable self shadowing and object cast as shadows. So if I have an object and I receive a shadow to get good shadows on that mesh you would need a good lightmap. It can be imported and the important real thing about lightmaps is that you need no overlapping UVs, it needs adequate padding and you need to be able to hide seams. It can be auto-generated by Unreal and it does actually a really good job but it's just I think to keep in mind that you are importing them. So if you take a look at the way the lightmap UVs actually work is you've got one model and there's two light sources here. The light is baked onto a lightmap texture and then you have the base color texture over that essentially where the lightmap gets multiplied on top of the base color texture. So the end result essentially relies entirely on displaying textures. That's the main important thing. There's nothing actually happening dynamically here. Now when you're building light, I'm going to take a look at this ourselves in a second, but when you're building lights it's important to know that there's different quality settings. Preview will be quick and give you a sort of rough and dirty approximation of what the light might look like and as you go up all the way to production, your baking times will be longer but you'll increase the quality of that light solution as you go up. So let's go ahead and take a look at the next exercise which will have us create some lights and bake them into the project. We'll see you there.",
