  "text": " So, in the last video we created a door blueprint and we've connected up the E button to an event. Now we're going to connect this event to opening and closing the door. So back to the blueprint here. I'm going to leave the print string here just so that we know that this is running in case we need to debug anything. Now the first thing that I'm going to connect after this, so I'm going to drag off and I'm going to search for a flip-flop mode. Now the flip-flop mode is a flow control mode and what it's going to do is the first time that we execute this, it's going to do whatever is attached to the A and the second time we do it, it's going to do whatever is attached to the B and then the third time it's going to go back to A and it will alternate between the two different options, meaning we can toggle something on and off. We will use it in this instance to open and close the door. Now after the flip-flop mode we're going to pull off and search for something that's called a timeline. On this timeline we're going to rename to be open slash close door. Now the first flip-flop is set to play. What I want to do is I want to connect the second one to reverse. So how a timeline works is this is going to run for when we push play the timeline is going to run for however long we set it off for and whenever we push reverse it will reverse from the point that it is to the beginning. So the play is going to exit play forward and reverse will reverse. Now we're not using the play from start or reverse from the end. So this means if we were to hit this off halfway through or we'd stop it for some reason it will pick up where it's left off. Now on the output pins for the timeline you can see we have an update and a finish. Now what a timeline will do is whilst this is B playing and updating it will trigger anything which is connected to the update pin on every frame of the game. So effectively on tick. What we're going to do is we're going to use this to animate and rotate the door out. And when it's finished it will execute anything that's attached to the finished sign. But we need to we need to set up some kind of output variables from this. So double click on the timeline to open it up and you've got to see that we get a page which looks a little bit like this. At the moment timeline is set to be to go on for five seconds. This is too long. We don't want the door to take five seconds to open. So let's change this to one second. Now next to this we have a plus track. If I click on the plus track you can see I have five options. Now we're going to use the add float track because we don't need anything more complicated. And that's going to create a new track that looks like this. And I'm going to call this door open alpha. Now all we want to do is we want to return a value between zero and one. And these values are going to determine how open the door is with zero being completely closed and one being completely open. And over the one second it is going to return different values depending on how far through in order for us to open the door. So let's add in some values. So place your cursor as close to zero zero as possible. Double click, right hand click and select add key to curve float zero. And up here I'm just going to make sure we've got absolutely zero zero. And now you can see that we have one key. And now I'm going to come up to the top right hand corner. So that's one second. And I'm going to add a curve, have add a key there. Now this is too low. What I want is I want the time to be one and the value to be one. Now as you can see this has now gone off the charts and we can't see what it looks like. However if I press the zoom to fit we now get a better idea. The way that the timeline is going to work is it's going to return a value to the update for every interval of time that it is pinged. So if the update happens zero it will return the value zero. However if the update happens 0.25 seconds since the timeline has started it will return 0.25 and the same for play five. And in the end when it finishes it will return the value one. This is going to on each tick return a different value. So we've got a very simple line here. But if it was slightly more complicated then we could get we could get more values out of that. Now I will now come back to the event graph and you'll see that a new output pin has appeared on the right hand side of the open to close. And that is the door open alpha. Now if I move to the right what I want to do is I want to grab the door mesh. I'm going to pull in a reference to that. So we have a reference to the door mesh and I'm going to drag off and I'm going to type in set or relative rotation. Now if I drag out and connect that up to the update this is going to allow us to set the rotation of the door. Now I don't know what rotations I want yet. To start with I'm probably going to stick with zero zero zero. So I don't know what I'm going to rotate. That doesn't matter too much because I'm using an alpha. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag off of the new rotator. And I'm going to type in love and there is an option for low rotator. Now what the love is is it is a shortening term for a linear interpolate. And what a linear interpolate would do is when this value is zero it will provide you it will provide the result of a when this alpha is one it will provide you the result of B and when it is point five it will return you halfway between these two values. And this is really useful for us to use in combination with now. So if I pull out in the alpha here. And if I change a we're fine with it being zero zero zero. So I'm going to need to figure out what rotation I need here at the end. So in order to do that I'm going to jump back to the viewport. I'm going to grab the door. I'm just going to rotate it out. I think about 90 degrees is good. So I know that my rotation that I want to get to is zero zero 90. I'll reset this back to the default and I'm going to jump back into the event graph. I'm just going to put 90 here. OK. So what this does now is it's going to use the timelines alpha on the lab to set the relative rotation of just the component the door mesh. And it will either play this from the beginning or from the other flip flop. It's going to reverse it back. So we're playing this timeline forwards and backwards. Let's test this out. Now, if I walk up to the door and press E, we can see that it opens. If I press E again, you can see that we are playing that timeline backwards and forwards for one second. Right. So we now have the functionality for the door to open and close. What I want to do next is we're going to look at locking this door.",
