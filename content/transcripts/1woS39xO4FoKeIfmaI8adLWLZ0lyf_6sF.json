  "text": " In this introductory class, you have learned about various aspects of Unreal Engine in a hands-on project-based approach. You have learned how to create a new project based on a startup template, learned to navigate the scenes and understand how a project is constructed. You have learned how to place and manipulate objects as actors, and how to save a level for later recall. You have also learned how to ingest data from various places, including from within the Engine, using the starter pack, from the marketplace, and also by importing your own user data into the Engine via the Datasmith tool. You have learned to create a simple sculpted landscape around your scene and then populated the environment by scattering trees with a paintbrush. Finally, you learned how to author simple materials, as well as the basics of daytime lighting. I hope you enjoyed this class, and I hope to see you again very soon. Thank you for watching!",
