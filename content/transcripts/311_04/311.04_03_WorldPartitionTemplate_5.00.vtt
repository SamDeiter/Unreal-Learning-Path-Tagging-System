00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So how do we get access to this world partition?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, world partition comes with a template that we can access from our launcher.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we can see here that the supported content, use one of these game templates,

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
can help ensure that your project is open world compliant right from the start.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So the blank, the first person, third person, top down and vehicle advanced are all project types

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and templates that can operate within the world partition.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You can enable the needed features later on using games template,

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
just to ensure that you are set up for success from the start.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Next, we need to make sure streaming is enabled.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So if you do not use the template, you can go to the world settings and then under world partition.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So world settings can be found from a window at the top and go down to world settings.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
World settings, you just want to go to this world partition section,

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
click enable streaming and this will set up the streaming portion.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But you still need to set up other items like world partition, one file per actor, data layers and HLOD.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So the template level that you'll open within your project, just from a new level box,

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
you can see that you can select the open world or empty open world

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and it'll start you off in a new map that's ready to use most of the world tools.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So the default open world comes with, so if we select this new level,

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that will come with world partition, one file per actor, data layers, the hierarchical level of detail,

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is a HLOD, it'll come with a sample 2K by 2K landscape, which you can see here,

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
with a landscape material and lighting set up for an outdoor environment,

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You also got use of the sky atmosphere here.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We've got the skylight, directional light, exponential height fog and also volumetric clouds.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So right out of the game, Unreal does a lot of the heavy lifting for us if we use this template open world.

26
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Then looking at the grid of world partition.

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So the second fact that we're using to determine whether a grid cell is loaded or unloaded at runtime

28
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is the settings of the runtime grid itself.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So runtime grid settings are located in the world settings.

30
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So again, go into that world settings panel.

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And then in the world partition setup section, which you can see here,

32
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we've got a 2D runtime hash grid that is provided by default.

33
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So you can see this runtime hash.

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So using more than one grid can negatively impact performance.

35
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So you just want to really go with one grid setup as that will impact performance.

36
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So size is in meters. So cell size, you've got meters there.

37
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So 25,600 is 256 square meters for cell size.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So the 76,800 loading range is 768 meter radius around the streaming source.

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So just to put those numbers into context, that's 768 meter radius around the streaming source.

40
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And then you'll need to experiment as each project will have just different requirements

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
based on what you're trying to achieve here.

42
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
To give an overview of the streaming source.

43
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So the streaming of grid cells within a grid at runtime is determined by two factors here.

44
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We've got the streaming source and then we've also got the runtime grid settings.

45
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The streaming source found on the left hand side here,

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the components that define a position in the world and trigger the loading of cells around them.

47
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So the player controllers in this instance are the streaming source.

48
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Other streaming sources can be added to the world using world partition streaming source component.

49
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
If you want that extra functionality over who or what is a streaming source in the project.

50
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When we're looking at streaming the grid, there are two components here.

51
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That we're using for controlling the loading of cells around the streaming source.

52
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So the streaming source components that define position in the world and trigger the loading of cells around them.

53
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So again, like we said in the previous instance, you'll see the player controller here.

54
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And the player controller is an example of the streaming source.

55
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And then the grid determines whether a grid cell is loaded or unloaded at runtime based on the cell size and the loading radius.

56
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So you can see these in the top down grid in action based on the settings that we set in the previous slide.

57
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So in order to see the grid working, you'll need to make sure you have a streaming source,

58
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which is usually the player seen in this image and then a content, some kind of content placed in the world,

59
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which we're getting from this template.

60
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So below the grid, you'll see a key that tells you what corresponds to the grid image.

61
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So if you need to understand what you're visualizing here, you'll see that key.

62
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then you can also view the grid using the commands WP.runtime.toggle.drawruntime.hash2d.

63
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And then also WP.runtime.toggle.drawruntime.hash3d.

64
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So the hash2d and the hash3d. And if you type in these, it may just auto complete those as well.

65
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You can find all this in the documentation as well.

66
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So if we're looking at converting our existing worlds into world partition,

67
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
you can use the world partition conversion commandlet like we mentioned at the start.

68
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So this is mainly for projects coming from UE4 that want to make the use of this UE5 feature.

69
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So if your documentation is going to be your friend here,

70
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you'll understand how to use this tool by digging into the documentation there.
