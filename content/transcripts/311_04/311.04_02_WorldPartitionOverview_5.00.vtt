00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's kick off by talking about exactly what World Partition is and giving you a bit of

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
an overview of this.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.860
So what is the big picture here?

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.940
So World Partition we can use to create open worlds that will require you to use a few

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.720
different tools in combination with each other.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.560
So all of these tools are designed to be used together to help you make open worlds run

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.900
more efficiently.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.340
And you just want to keep in mind that some of the tools can be used independently if

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.480
you know, one or a combination aren't supported.

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.520
So let's talk about World Partition in the top left here.

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.380
So World Partition is an automatic data management and distance based level streaming system

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.900
that provides a complete solution for a large world management.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.600
So if we're making any kind of large worlds and we want to take into account level streaming,

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.980
World Partition is our go-to here.

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.100
One file per actor reduces overlap between users by saving data for instances of actors

16
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.180
in external files, removing the need to save main level file when making changes to its

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.180
actors.

18
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.820
So traditionally or historically, if you've used Unreal Engine, you may have had different

19
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.780
departments working on different streamed levels inside of Unreal Engine, maybe just

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.740
more for organization purposes, making sure multiple people can be working on the file.

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.500
Now you can use one file per actor, which means users can work on individual actors

22
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.300
and submit them to the change lists and things that you're working on rather than submitting

23
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.260
entire level files, which is a massive improvement to a workflow there.

24
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.700
We got level instancing on the top right here and level instancing is a level based workflow

25
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.100
that facilitates the porting of non-world partition worlds to world partition system.

26
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.140
We've also got data layers and data layers are systems within world partition used for

27
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.740
organizing your actors into separate layers.

28
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.340
Then we've got the HLOD.

29
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.940
The world partition is the hierarchical level of detail.

30
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420
That's what HLOD stands for, hierarchical level of detail.

31
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.700
That's a system that uses custom HLOD layers to organize large amounts of static meshes

32
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.740
and generates a single proxy at a mesh and a material to use within that HLOD.

33
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.620
We got virtual textures and we need this for the MIP map to work.

34
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.420
So virtualizing the textures will make the MIP maps function correctly here.

35
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.540
We've also got virtual shadows.

36
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.420
The virtual texture support for our project enables us to create and use large scale textures

37
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740
for lower and more consistent memory footprints at runtime.

38
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.900
Then using Nanite, Nanite is UE5's virtualized geometry system, which uses new internal mesh

39
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.420
format and rendering technology to render pixel scale and detail at high object count.

40
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.060
So you can have much higher poly meshes, more detail in your scene using this Nanite technology.

41
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.100
Other additional tools that can also help, but we won't be covering today, which is

42
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.980
the mass entity and smart object.

43
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.180
So you could do a bit of research on the documentation for mass entity and smart objects if you'd

44
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.140
like to go into more detail in those areas.

45
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.500
So let's look at world partition overview.

46
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.460
So when all of these tools are used together, you can make something like this.

47
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.900
So the top image is the city sample, aka the matrix awakens.

48
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.940
And then we've also got the valley of the ancients demo down in the left hand side here.
