00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
So thank you for checking out today's Unreal Engine training on world partition techniques

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120
and applications in 5.0.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.680
We've covered a lot of ground with a lot of features, so we talked about the world partition

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.160
and what it is, how to get set up using world partition in your templates, and also just

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.860
how to enable it in your projects if you have existing projects where you didn't use a template.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.420
We covered all the different tools that come with world partition, and then we also gave

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.020
a couple of debug commands at the end.

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.720
So hopefully you found that useful to just get an overview of what world partition is

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.660
and how you might use it in your projects.

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.340
So thank you again for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.
