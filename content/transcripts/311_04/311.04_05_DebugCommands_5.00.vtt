00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Before we close out, let's just go over a couple of debug commands that you have access

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.680
to with World Partition.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.080
So run in the console command wp.runtime.toggledraw runtime hash 2D.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.220
And again, this should auto fill on your console command.

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.940
You can find these console commands on the documentation as well.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.780
So read that again.

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.740
So it's wp.runtime.toggledraw runtime hash 2D.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.620
At runtime displays the HLOD cells that are loaded in the green.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.380
And then you can also see the 3D version of the same command.

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.220
So instead of using runtime hash 2D, you just use runtime hash 3D.

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.500
So they can just help visualize what's going on in your scenes there.
