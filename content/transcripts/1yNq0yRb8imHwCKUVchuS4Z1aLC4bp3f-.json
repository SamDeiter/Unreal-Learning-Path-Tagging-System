  "text": " Now that we have painted our landscape with our rock, our grass, and our dirt, let's talk about how we can quickly apply foliage to our landscape using the Foliage tool. Now, the Foliage tool is a tool that allows you to take any static mesh and paint that on the surface of either a landscape, other static meshes, even other foliage message and translucent surfaces. Now, working with foliage is very simple. All we have to do is open up our Foliage tool and then select the mesh we wish to paint. We do this by selecting it and dragging it to the drop foliage here. Let's pop over to the editor really quick and see how we would do this. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to get out of my landscape mode and go to my Foliage. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit Control Space on my keyboard and I'm going to go to the Starter Content here. And inside the Starter Content, I'm going to look for some props and I'm going to grab this SM Bush and just drag it right over here. With the Bush added, I can now select it. I do need to make sure that this Activate checkmark is enabled. And now if I hold down my left mouse button, you'll see these bushes added. And if I hold down Shift, I will erase them. Now there's a lot of really cool things that we can do with these particular assets as we start to add them and erase them. As you can see right down here, we have things like painting, which will control the density, the radius or the collision that this needs to be, the size this needs to be in order to stop other instances of this from penetrating it when we paint. We also have things like the ability to control its scale underneath placement here. We have the ability to control its placement, so how high it's off the surface or how down low, whether it's randomly pitched or things like that. The Foliage tool also has the ability to come in here and we can actually select. If I click on select here, whoops, and let me just click on one of these right here. It's like for some reason I cannot select it. So let's just go back to paint and go back to select. Oh, there we go. And if I hit F on the keyboard, I will focus in on that and then we can just pull this around. We can also rotate it. We can scale it and we can also delete these if we want. So what I want everybody to do now is take a few more minutes of your time and add some foliage to your particular project. And you can use the Foliage tool with assets you get from Quixel or just use the standard props and get used to adding tools and get used to adding meshes to your Foliage and get used to adding message to the Foliage tool and then using the Foliage tool to paint and interact with the meshes. Thanks for watching!",
