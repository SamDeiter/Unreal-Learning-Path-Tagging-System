  "text": " So at this point, as soon as you hit the button, the door is going to be unlocked. But let's look at changing this so that you have to hit the button three times in order for it to unlock. Okay, it's relatively straightforward, but we're going to need to change the code a little bit. What we're going to need to do is create another conditional branch here, which will check to see the amount of times that it's been overlapped before it allows you to actually go in and unlock the door. So to start with, let's create another variable. Add variable. Now you can see that this has copied the previous tie. So again, we have another BP door. However, we don't want that. We just want a simple count. So we're going to change this to an integer. So an integer is just a whole number. It's very quick to use. And we're going to change the name of this to lock count. And if we push compile, we can see the default value is starting from zero. Now what we're looking to do is count up the amount of times that the amount of times has been overlapped. So if you drag in the lock count, and let's get it because we need to know the map times that it's been unlocked to this point. And now we could use a set at this point in order to change it to another number. We'd need to add in a few different modes in order to get that to work. So we can see that there is a remade macro here called increment int. And this will go away and automatically add plus one to the value. So we don't need a set. This will do the whole thing. So every time we are going to run into this lock, it's going to increase that by one. And we can print this out. So we can see it to screen. And I'm just going to connect the lock count up with the hello string. And you can see as I float over this, it automatically says convert integer to string. So this is a helpful little conversion node that we have here so that we can visualize how many times it's been overlapped with. Move this out of the way. We want to add in a branch node at this point. And this is a good moment to talk about hotkeys, where originally we would search for branch here. Since branch is such a commonly used function, they've actually assigned a hotkey to it. If you hold down the B key and left click, it'll go away and create a branch automatically. And let's plug that in. Now, for the lock count, we could plug this in to be a boolean, but a boolean will only be a 0 to 1 variable, with one being true. So that's not going to be the specific condition we want. In this instance, we want to check that you've done it at least three times. So in this case, we're going to do a greater than. So this is giving us an integer versus integer greater than. So what this is going to say is, is this integer greater than the integer that we have coming into here? Now, at the moment it defaults to 0, but let's change that to 2. So this means that the value that's going to come out of here is going to be true if this value is more than 2, and if it's less than 2, it's going to be false. And we're capable of plugging that directly into the branch. Now, there are numerous different settings, numerous different codes that you can have in here. And you can also use things like not to inverse them, ands and or gates, like in any normal coding language, if you are used to that. So in this instance, what this is going to do is it's going to check the lock count and see if that is more than 2. And if it is, it's going to come through true. And if it's not, it's going to come through false. And so if it is more than 2, let's connect it up to the branch. And at that point, we will allow it to open the door. OK, so let's give this a go. So if I press play and I try and open the door, you can see that nothing happens. However, if I come to the left here, you can see that I've actually jumped past it. So I've done I've overlapped the condition twice now. So it should still not open. Yeah, doesn't open. Now if you can see the little button in the top, now it says 3 in the debug in the top left hand corner. So at this point, the door is now ready to open. So you can see that and continue overlapping with this and the number is going to continue going up. But because, well, firstly, the door is already unlocked. However, it is also above the number required. So that is going to continue to to unlock the door.",
