1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that we have created some 2D fire liquids and smoke, let's take a look at creating their

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.759
3D counterparts.

3
00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.280
Now creating the 3D version of these effects is very similar to creating the 2D version.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.440
We right click inside of the content browser, we select Niagara System, and then from the

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.359
Create Niagara System dialog box, we look for Niagara Fluids, and then for this example,

6
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.800
we are going to select the grid, 3D, gas, and fire, and then hit the Create button.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.800
So let's go ahead and do that now.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.640
So we are going to right click inside of our content browser, then we are going to look

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:44.359
for our grid, 3D, gas, and fire, and hit Create NS underscore 3D gas fire.

10
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.439
And let's go ahead and double click on that to open it up.

11
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:55.079
Now this is going to look very similar to our other setup where we have a particle

12
00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.960
admitter source, but instead of everything being done in one single admitter, we actually

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.280
have two.

14
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.159
And it's going to work like this.

15
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.280
So across the top here, this is our Niagara overview node.

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.519
This is going to show us things like exposed user parameters and properties and things

17
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.879
like that.

18
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.640
We have our particle source admitter.

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.439
This is going to work as our node for admitting the particles.

20
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
So however the particles are going to be admitted and then behave and move around the world

21
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.520
we will be taking care of inside of this node, the grid 3D gas master node, what that's going

22
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.280
to do is handle how the fluid simulation takes place.

23
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.880
Then we are going to take that fluid simulation and actually skin it to the particle source

24
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.380
admitter.

25
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.439
And the really cool thing about that is we now have the ability to make our particles

26
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.840
move in any which way we want and then have our simulation put on top of those particles

27
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.439
and by sim taking the simulation for the fluid and the simulation for the particles and making

28
00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.200
this separation again allows us to do really, really interesting things like we can have

29
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.800
a trail of fire that follows a specific path or other interesting effects like that.

30
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.719
One of the other things to note when you click on the grid 3D gas master effect, the details

31
00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:23.639
panel, even though it's going to be by default in admitter summary mode is going to be full

32
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.439
of options.

33
00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.439
Don't worry about all of the options that are there.

34
00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.680
The cool thing is is that you only need to adjust a few of them to actually really affect

35
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.159
how the look and the feel of the smoke and the fire reacts and that's because we're trying

36
00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.199
to create something that is life like.

37
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:48.679
So remember when we are adjusting these things, we want to use very small values and we don't

38
00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:54.039
want to push things too far or it's going to make stuff look weird because it's not going

39
00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.919
to be physically correct.

40
00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.280
And what we want to do is we want to be able to have things look maybe a little artistic,

41
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.959
but in the end still be physically accurate so that we can maintain artistic control and

42
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.840
we don't really have to worry too much about the feasibility of building the effect.

43
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.439
So let's go ahead and just pop over to the editor really quick and have a look at our

44
00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.439
effect here.

45
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.439
So here we go.

46
00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.439
Here's our fire effect.

47
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.920
So again, we have our particle, admitter source and this is going to work just like

48
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:38.079
it does normally if we do something like, I don't know, like change the sprite size

49
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.159
or something like that, it's going to change the size of the particles that are admitted

50
00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.599
and then that's going to have a resulting on the end flame there.

51
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.919
So this is pretty standard, but then if we come over here to our grid 3D gas, this is

52
00:03:52.919 --> 00:04:00.719
where we're going to be able to start adjusting all of the various properties for our gas

53
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.599
and smoke and fire simulation.

54
00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.800
Now to make things a little bit easier for us, I'm going to highlight here some of the

55
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.240
things that you might want to consider adjusting to start with.

56
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.919
So first off, there is the pressure solve iterations by reducing that number.

57
00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.720
You're going to be reducing the number of times that we solve for pressure and you're

58
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.839
going to make the fire well run a little faster, but it is not going to be as realistic.

59
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:29.800
If we increase this number, which it defaults to 200, I believe we are going to make the

60
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.520
fire have more pressure iterations and become more realistic at the expense of memory and

61
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520
compute time.

62
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.400
So again, this is set to, I'm sorry, pressure solve, not 200 by default, it's set to three.

63
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.800
Let's go ahead and just set this or set this to three.

64
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.000
It's set to 10 by default.

65
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.759
I'm going to set it to three.

66
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.960
It's going to just make things run a little bit faster.

67
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.840
Our pressure relaxation, this is a, I'm going to turn this up to three here.

68
00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.560
These values don't really correlate to anything that I got.

69
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.199
They're just values that I happen to pick as I was crafting things.

70
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.919
So feel free to adjust these or use other values.

71
00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.919
These are just some areas that I know of that we can get some good results.

72
00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.879
So then finally, I'm going to do our density buoyancy to 0.1 and our temperature buoyancy

73
00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.399
to three or I'm sorry, not three, a 0.3.

74
00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:29.560
And then our velocity dissipation, we're going to set that to a value of one.

75
00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.360
All right.

76
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.120
And then we're just going to compile and save this.

77
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.439
All right.

78
00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.800
Just to mess with some of the values to, you know, give us something to work with here.

79
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.920
And the other cool thing that we can do with this one is we can actually have this

80
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.920
be admitted right from a static mesh.

81
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.600
So all we need to do is place a static mesh and then inside of our particle system

82
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.639
underneath the static mesh here and the user parameters, we have this source actor.

83
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.719
We can actually sample this and use it to admit our particles from.

84
00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:05.759
So let's take a look at that now.

85
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.480
So got this, we're going to go ahead and close this down.

86
00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:10.040
There we go.

87
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.639
We're going to hit control space, bring our admitted in to the level.

88
00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.240
So there we go.

89
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.360
And then I'm going to come up here to our quickly add to our shapes.

90
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.199
We're going to add a sphere, move this up and then make sure that we do have our

91
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.560
particles selected here.

92
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.079
There's our 3D gas.

93
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.199
And then we come down here.

94
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.120
Static measures will probably be collapsed.

95
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.000
So you need to un-collapse it.

96
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.639
And then we're going to select this and right there.

97
00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.680
Oh, wrong one.

98
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.519
Not the one I wanted.

99
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.480
I wanted this sphere right here.

100
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.720
It will not work if it's not in the volume.

101
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.360
So we do need to make sure that that is in the volume.

102
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.160
But check that out.

103
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.000
It is now admitting from the surface of this sphere.

104
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.639
So that is actually really, really cool.

105
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.639
And if we were to, like, you know, move this around, you can see here, well, we

106
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.879
need to actually move both of them around in order to get the effect there.

107
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.960
But that's actually really, really cool.

108
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.800
So we've got that fire following that sphere and it's already set up to work like that.

109
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.240
All right.

110
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.840
So the next effect we're going to be taking a look at is liquid.

111
00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:17.359
Now, in particular, we're going to be taking a look at our grid 3D flip hose.

112
00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.839
There are a few other ones such as the flip pool and the flip splash.

113
00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.560
And these work similar to their 2D counterparts here.

114
00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.439
The other one, shallow water.

115
00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:33.799
This is great for if we're simulating something like a small puddle or maybe a boat wake.

116
00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:40.639
But for now, we're going to focus mainly on the grid 3D flip hose as this is one of the

117
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.000
ones that's a little bit cooler.

118
00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:46.759
And also this is pushing modern VFX to its limits.

119
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.399
This is actually a really, really advanced technique and something that's really,

120
00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.959
really cool and fun and interesting to work with inside of the editor.

121
00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.680
So like we do with all of our other particles, we're going to go to the

122
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.879
content browser, right click Niagara system.

123
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.519
And then from the create Niagara system browser, we're going to select our grid 3D flip

124
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.759
hose and hit the create button.

125
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.639
Let's go ahead and do that now.

126
00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:14.199
So make sure we delete, oops, delete this effect here.

127
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.439
And I was just saying that because I had deleted the sphere and it was referenced.

128
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.800
So I'm going to delete that.

129
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.439
And then we're going to come into our content browser, right click Niagara system.

130
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:32.360
We're going to look for our flip grid 3D flip hose and hit create NS underscore 3D.

131
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.799
Just call us water.

132
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.159
And let's double click on this to open it up.

133
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.399
Now, again, depending on how fast your system is and a whole bunch of other things,

134
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.079
this could take a little bit to open up.

135
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.120
It could take a little while to compile.

136
00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:45.879
So just keep that in mind.

137
00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:51.639
This is going to look a little bit different than what we are used to, even

138
00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.759
though it is kind of similar.

139
00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:57.199
Let me just move the details panel over a little bit here because we actually

140
00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:58.639
have this grid flip.

141
00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:01.199
And then there's going to be another one right over here.

142
00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:02.759
And this other one, you're like, oh, it's got two.

143
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:08.439
It doesn't actually, this is another admitter that is used to create white water.

144
00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:13.559
So we're going to focus on this other meter right here for now and look at the white

145
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.000
water one in just a little bit.

146
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.360
So again, remember, we are creating a natural phenomena.

147
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.759
So while this might look like it, absolute ton of parameters, there's not too

148
00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:27.559
many that we actually need to adjust inside of here.

149
00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:33.759
In fact, for this particular effect, many of the things that we need to adjust

150
00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:37.479
are actually already exposed to us under user parameters such as our collision

151
00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:44.159
velocity, our number of cells, max axis, this is going to control the quality of it,

152
00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:46.639
the water height and the great extents.

153
00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:50.679
That's pretty much all that we need to have exposed because remember, water is

154
00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:55.439
going to work exactly the same way in the digital world as it does in the physical

155
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.040
one, because we are using the laws of physics to actually run this simulation.

156
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.240
Now, with that said, there are some properties that we need to be aware of so

157
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:11.400
that we can make sure that our water uses only the resources that it needs.

158
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.840
Now, the first thing that I'm going to do is enable this show bounds.

159
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.880
And what this is going to do is it's going to show us with this red outline here,

160
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.560
the maximum and minimum area that the simulation is going to take place in.

161
00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:27.599
If I come over here to my world grid extents and I was to increase or decrease

162
00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:32.000
these numbers, as you can see like this, what we've done here is we have taken

163
00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:37.359
the height of that and instead of being 500 with a bunch of empty space up here,

164
00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:41.679
we put it down to 400, which brings it way closer to the admission point.

165
00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:45.479
Again, the reason that we're doing this is we don't ever plan to have water go

166
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:46.639
all the way up here.

167
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:51.279
So all that area is going to be unused inside of our simulation.

168
00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:56.919
And just because it's used doesn't mean that it doesn't need to occupy memory.

169
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.919
So we want to bring this down as low as possible.

170
00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.879
So let's look at how we can set this up now.

171
00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:05.519
So inside of here, I'm going to close this because we don't actually need that.

172
00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:10.079
I hit control space, bring in my water by just control dragging that in.

173
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.439
And again, by default, it's not actually going to show me the bounds.

174
00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.000
So we come over here with it selected and we go to show bounds.

175
00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:19.360
And there is the bounds for this particular object.

176
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.360
And then what I can do here is let's just set this as something like 300.

177
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.200
There we go.

178
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.480
And this also highlights something else, even though it is actually admitting

179
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.600
outside and it's cutting the bounds off, that's something that you need to be aware

180
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.440
of. You want to set this something low, but not so low that your

181
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.560
emission source kind of gets cut off or it starts to make things look unrealistic.

182
00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:43.120
Now, some of the other things that we can adjust here, this

183
00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:46.039
numb cells max per axis.

184
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.000
If I set this as something like 16, check this out.

185
00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:52.879
It's going to give us this very wobbly and blobby looking water right there.

186
00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.399
If I was to increase this to like 64, or let's just see what was the default.

187
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.519
I think the default was 92.

188
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.720
So let's try 128.

189
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.720
It's going to give us this very, very, very, very finite water

190
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.919
that actually is having problems pooling.

191
00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:14.759
You can see here that the water is so fine that it's not actually collecting

192
00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.399
with other stuff.

193
00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.480
So we might need to turn this down to maybe like 100.

194
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.960
And there we go.

195
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.639
We get some better pooling action.

196
00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:25.759
So just remember water and liquids is going to be really

197
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.720
balancing act between getting your settings and the performance just right.

198
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.000
Other thing to note here are pressure iterations.

199
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.360
This is going to control basically

200
00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:44.039
how many pressure time, how many times pressure is used to

201
00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:46.639
push the water around the world.

202
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.360
And the more we increase this, the more realistic results we're going to get.

203
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.959
Just remember though, as we increase this, it is going to crease the memory

204
00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:57.679
footprint of our particular project.

205
00:12:57.679 --> 00:13:00.759
So we might run into performance issues as we do that.

206
00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:06.360
One of the other cool things we can do with the water is make it collide

207
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.679
with static meshes.

208
00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:11.360
Now, all you need to do for this to work is just simply add the object

209
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.800
and make sure you have the tag collider added to it.

210
00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:19.159
So we're going to come over here and we're just going to come down to our

211
00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.720
quickly add to projects.

212
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.919
We're going to come to our shapes and add a sphere.

213
00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:27.680
Now, with the sphere like this, notice that nothing is actually happening.

214
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.639
It's not actually doing anything.

215
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.000
But if I come to this, I search for my tag and we add the tag of collider.

216
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.960
And let me just move this now.

217
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.720
Check that out.

218
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.159
Look at that.

219
00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:42.199
It's actually colliding with the water.

220
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.279
You can see here that the water is actually bouncing off of it now, going

221
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.519
around it instead of directly through it.

222
00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.839
And again, I just added the tag collider.

223
00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:55.919
Now you can also do this with the third person character or any other

224
00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:56.679
skeletal mesh.

225
00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:04.039
Just make sure that you have the tag collider added to your character blueprint.

226
00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:06.639
If you don't have a character blueprint in your current project, you can add

227
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:10.439
a feature of content pack and then select the third person character.

228
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.159
Once you've added that look for the BP third person character blueprint, open it

229
00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:20.240
up and then in the details panel, search for tag and add collider.

230
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.600
And let's do that now because right now, if I was to play this, nothing is going

231
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.080
to happen.

232
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.919
I'm just going to kind of sit here and not really collide.

233
00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:29.639
So I'm going to hit control space.

234
00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:33.799
We are going to look for our third person, our blueprint open to open it up.

235
00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.399
Come over to our details panel.

236
00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.720
We're going to search for tag and then we're going to add the tag collider.

237
00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:44.360
Compile save.

238
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.079
Let's close that now and we hit play.

239
00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:54.559
And we'll see here that as this starts to fill up, I will start to move the water around.

240
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.039
You can see I'm kind of doing it a little bit now.

241
00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:03.679
And there we go.

242
00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:07.679
As it starts to fill up, you can see I'm making a little bit more of a splash

243
00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:09.039
note pun intended.

244
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:13.639
So let me close this off and I'm going to hit control R to stop that from rendering

245
00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:18.759
because what I want to do now is I want to come back to our water here and I'm

246
00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:26.679
going to enable this extra one right here and we'll do a compile and we'll do a

247
00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:29.479
save and you can see already I've got the white water going on there.

248
00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.799
So we're going to close this down.

249
00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:36.919
And while that closes down, let's take a look at what's going to happen next.

250
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:42.679
So you can see here as I enter the volume, it's actually going to be displaced by the

251
00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:43.639
water, the character.

252
00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:49.120
We can also adjust the water height, which will allow the water to only be spawned to

253
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.639
a certain height.

254
00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.519
This is fantastic.

255
00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:56.359
If you want to use this to say fill a puddle of some particular area instead of having

256
00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:59.959
to adjust how long the water lasts or figure out how to get rid of extra water or

257
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.079
something like that, you just simply adjust the water height to be the height of

258
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.480
whatever object it is that it is meant to occupy.

259
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.680
And the simulation will take care of the rest.

260
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.160
Also, the water does react like real water.

261
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.759
As you'll see here in just a second, when that white water splashes or when the water

262
00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:25.480
gets displaced by the character, it's actually creating particles that are coming off

263
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.720
of the main water as a real splash in real life would be.

264
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.360
So it's a very, very complex simulation we have going here.

265
00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:32.879
So let's close this down.

266
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.560
There we go.

267
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.759
Oops, we don't want to close the whole thing down.

268
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.039
We're going to hit play.

269
00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:41.519
And there we go.

270
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.000
Look at that.

271
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.440
We've got the white water coming off of it.

272
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.080
So it's splashing around.

273
00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:50.519
And then as I as I move through, I will kick up more white water.

274
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.720
And again, these are just the default settings.

275
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.039
So it might not look as realistic as it could, but this is just the default.

276
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:04.039
We can come in here and adjust, you know, how long the white water stays around

277
00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:05.440
and all types of other things.

278
00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.839
But yeah, look at this.

279
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.839
We're getting some really, really great results inside of here.

280
00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:15.119
So all right, that is going to bring us to the end of this part.

281
00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.279
And the next part of our tutorial, we're going to take a look at how we can utilize

282
00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:26.799
some of the built in features of Niagara to help optimize our smoke, liquid and

283
00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:34.599
fire effects by rendering their complex effects down to a texture and then using

284
00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:39.200
a sub UV particle to help play that back in real time, giving us the illusion of

285
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.680
this really complex matter taking place.

286
00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:44.440
But in fact, it's just a flip book playback.
