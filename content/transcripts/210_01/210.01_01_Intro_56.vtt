00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.839
Greetings everybody, my name is Sam Dider and I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor with

2
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.839
Epic Games.

3
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.200
In the following video tutorial, we're going to be taking a look at Niagara fluids.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.600
We're first going to start by taking a look at an overview of Niagara fluids, going over

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.839
the various fluids that we can make using the system.

6
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.440
We're next going to jump into Unreal and look at how we enable the Niagara fluids plugin.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.320
Then we'll take a look at the various Niagara fluid content example maps, which show you

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.200
how you can utilize fluids in many different ways inside of the engine.

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.040
It's a great resource to come back to to see what you can do with the various fluid emitters

10
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.719
that Unreal Engine 5 provides.

11
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.760
Next we're going to take a look at creating 2D smoke, liquid and fire effects by actually

12
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:58.599
creating some smoke and 2D liquid effects.

13
00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:03.640
We're then going to move on to creating 3D liquid smoke and fire effects.

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.679
Then finally we're going to finish up with some ways to optimize our smoke, liquid and

15
00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:14.920
fluid effects so that they can run more performant and even be used on platforms that might not

16
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.159
necessarily support them.

17
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.280
With this introduction out of the way, let's go ahead and get started by taking a look

18
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.400
at our Niagara fluids overview.
