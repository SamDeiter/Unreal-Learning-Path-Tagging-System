00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
And with that, that's going to wrap it up for this tutorial series about how to utilize

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.519
liquid inside of Niagara with the Niagara Fluids plugin.

3
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.240
Real quickly to recap what we did today, we first started out by going over the Niagara

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
Fluids overview, just covering what Niagara Fluids is and what you can create with the

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920
system.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.800
We then took a look at enabling the Niagara Fluids plugin, how to enable that inside of

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.920
the editor, where to find it, and also make sure to restart once you have enabled it.

8
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.320
We then talked about the Niagara Fluid content example, which is a great map in the content

9
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.560
example collection that shows you how to use all of the various Niagara liquids as well

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:53.920
as features such as collision, multicolored smoke, and other various bits of interaction.

11
00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.800
We then moved on to creating 2D smoke, liquid, and fire effects, followed up by creating

12
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.840
the 3D version of smoke, liquid, and fire effects.

13
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.480
And finally, we finished up looking at how we can optimize our smoke, liquid, and fire

14
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.680
effects using the Baker inside of Niagara to bake our complex Niagara liquids to a series

15
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.120
of still images that allow them to be played back, mimicking that real time behavior.

16
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.240
Well, that's all that I have for you.

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.439
Again, my name is Sam Dider.

18
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.320
I'm a senior Unreal Engine instructor, and I will see you next time.
