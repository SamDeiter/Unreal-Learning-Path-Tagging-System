00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
Before we start creating particles using Niagara fluids, I'd like us to have a quick overview

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.439
look at the system to better understand exactly what it is that the system offers us and what

3
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:19.640
kind of fluids we can make with the Niagara Fluids plugin.

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120
So first off, what are Niagara fluids?

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.080
Well when we say Niagara fluids, what we're actually talking about is a tool set for creating

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.039
real time liquids.

7
00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.759
This tool set was designed to be artist friendly and we're going to find that it includes a

8
00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.920
variety of GP based simulators, reusable modules, and robust data structures that are all accessible

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.479
within the Niagara editor.

10
00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:49.060
We can use all of these various Niagara components to build different 2D and 3D versions of real

11
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.280
time fluids and gases and fires that you might find in the real world.

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.320
The reason we want to use Niagara fluids is actually most of the work is done for you.

13
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.040
Since we are trying to recreate a physical phenomena, all we really have to do is just

14
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.740
adjust a few values and most of the heavy lifting or underlying work has already been

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.520
done for us and what we're going to get is a really, really efficient 2D or 3D version

16
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.700
of whatever smoke or liquid or fire we're trying to simulate.

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.780
Now whatever we are trying to simulate, we're going to find that there are different versions.

18
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.659
There's a 2D gas, a 2D liquid, a 3D gas, a 3D liquid, and shallow water and each one

19
00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.900
of these are going to be utilized for something slightly different.

20
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.740
The 2D gas is where flow only occurs in the X and the Y dimension.

21
00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:53.019
This is really suited for real time simulations and while it might only be a 2D representation,

22
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:58.179
it can interact with geometry and the characters.

23
00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.979
One other thing to note about the 2D gas and 2D flip is that the simulations do face the

24
00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.780
camera so that no matter where the camera is pointed, it's always going to align with

25
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.659
the camera making them good for things like fire or a water effect.

26
00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:23.699
Now our 3D gas is going to be the most common type of simulation used to simulate gas or

27
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.860
fire or smoke.

28
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:34.099
However, it is going to have a much more complex or higher memory and GPU cost and therefore

29
00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.819
it's best used for hero effects in real time applications or for cinematics.

30
00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:46.259
We can bake the results of these into textures which we'll talk about in a little bit, but

31
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:51.620
if you want to make heavy use of these, remember that it's going to be very expensive in terms

32
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.539
of memory and GPU memory.

33
00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:02.180
Now the 2D flip stands for fluid implicit particle and it's simply referring to how

34
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.379
the particle system is set up behind the scenes which you don't need to talk about right now.

35
00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.579
The difference between the 2D flip and the 3D flip is this.

36
00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:22.819
The 2D flip samples 3D particles but it generates a 2D simulation where pressure is solved and

37
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:32.180
applied to the particles giving it a 3D look but at a 2D cost.

38
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.260
The 3D flip on the other hand is simulating full 3D water interaction allowing you to interact

39
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.939
with the water with the character or static mesh and the water will then move up and around

40
00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.659
just as water would in the real world.

41
00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.020
Actually very very interesting and great particle to mess with and we'll see that here in just

42
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.420
a little bit.

43
00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:03.219
Now the 3D flip you might think would be something that we would use maybe all over for all types

44
00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.500
of different bodies of water and unfortunately while it is good at some things it is not

45
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.019
good at other things and that is where the shallow water comes in.

46
00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.939
Now the shallow water is useful for simulating pools of water that don't contain many splash

47
00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.060
effects.

48
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.419
This could be also used to simulate things like boatwakes or simple interactions with

49
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.740
objects moving through the water.

50
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.620
So again the type of fluid that we pick is going to depend on the situation at hand so

51
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.540
we don't necessarily need to always use a 3D gas or a shallow water or a 3D flip.

52
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.460
We can use combinations of 2D gases and 3D gases and 3D flips and 2D flips and we'll

53
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.259
see how all of this gets put together in the next couple of slides.
