00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.679
Before we can begin to use the Niagara fluids in our project, we need to enable the Niagara

2
00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:16.800
fluid plugin. Now this is pretty simple to do. All we need to do is go to the Plugins menu,

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.839
look for FX, and then there is Niagara fluid and we just enable it and restart the editor.

4
00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.839
I'm going to go ahead and do that now. So inside of my editor, I'm going to come over

5
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.960
to the Plugins menu, bring this on the screen here, go over to our FX, and we're going to

6
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.439
look for Niagara fluids and we are going to enable that. And then we're going to hit Restart

7
00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.879
Now. Once we have done that, we are going to then right click on the Content Browser,

8
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.000
go to Niagara System, and then we will be able to select this little wizard here. And

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.799
if we click on Niagara fluids, we will then have the ability to see all of the different

10
00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:03.959
Niagara fluids that we have access to. So let's just pop back over here to the editor

11
00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.519
and have a look at that now. So again, hit Control Space. I'm going to disable my Level

12
00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:15.799
Filter. Come up to my Content, right click, and then from the menu here, select the Niagara

13
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.079
System. And we're going to go to Niagara fluids. And if we want, we can go 2D, 2D Liquid, 3D

14
00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.879
Gas, 3D Liquid. There is some shallow water is the last one I wanted to show you, or we

15
00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.159
can look at all of them here. And all we need to do to select one of these and use it as

16
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.959
the basis is simply just select it and then hit Create. Now, once we do that behind the

17
00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:50.640
scenes, what is actually going on here is our Niagara is built off of very, very, very

18
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.239
complex inheritance. And inheritance in our case is actually used to progressively add

19
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:04.439
more and more functionality. So instead of all of the fluid behavior being done in one

20
00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.159
single module, and we use that one single module to do everything, we have it kind of

21
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:18.439
split up like this. So we have our basic three grid 3D gas emitter at the base here. And

22
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:24.319
then from that, we have the grid gas control. So these are going to be controls that control

23
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.680
this. And then we further refine those. We have some controls for just a regular emitter.

24
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.079
And then we have some controls for our cinematic version or a higher quality version. And then

25
00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.400
finally, we actually have our Niagara system that we are going to be creating. So the Niagara

26
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.400
system is what we just created here using one of these, the grid 2D flip hose, or the

27
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.639
3D flip hose or something like that, that would be the Niagara system. And that system,

28
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.719
again, it's going to be made up of a collection of these different Niagara admitters. Now,

29
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.879
the reason I'm bringing this up is because inheritance or knowing that inheritance plays

30
00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.319
a functionality here is going to be a key to expanding upon these emitters in the future.

31
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.919
Or it's just important to know that all of this stuff is built upon multiple emitters, and not

32
00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.439
just one single massive emitter.
