00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
The Niagara Fluids content example is a great way to get more familiar with how you can

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.160
use Niagara Fluids in any Unreal Engine project.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.080
Inside of this content example map, you're going to find different fluids from fire and

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.080
water.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's take a look at this now because there's some really interesting things that we can

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.760
see inside of here.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.080
So here I have the content examples open.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.160
I have Niagara Fluids.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
That's the level name.

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.320
You can see here there's just a ton of different types of simulations and things here.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.399
Now some of these we do need to see if I come up here and I'm just going to do a simulate

12
00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.399
here.

13
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.399
Some of these will work.

14
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.519
Some of them I actually do need to be playing for this to actually happen.

15
00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.719
So let me just right click and we will play from here so we can see.

16
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.719
There we go.

17
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.799
For example, here's a camera facing and non-facing for our 2D.

18
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.679
Here is a torch that has a parented so that it's actually following around as the object

19
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.239
moves throughout the world.

20
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.719
This is 2D collisions and it goes on and on and on.

21
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.840
There's just a whole bunch of great, great, great examples in here.

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.159
So again, this is the content examples map.

23
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.679
Niagara Fluids, very, very, very useful and something that I suggest that everybody check

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.640
out to get more information on how to use Niagara in their project, especially when

25
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.120
it comes to fluids.
