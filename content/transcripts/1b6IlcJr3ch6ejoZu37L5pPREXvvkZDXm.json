  "text": " Hello, everyone, and welcome to Unity to Unreal. This is a course designed for Unreal Engine 5.6 about transitioning your workflow from Unity to Unreal Engine. This course is being brought to you today by myself, Alex Coulombe, as well as with Sellers. We are Unreal Engine authorized instructor partners and look forward to teaching you the ins and outs of going from Unity to Unreal. So what are we going to be covering today? First, we're going to get our bearings. We're going to do an overview of basic concepts inside of Unity and Unreal. And we're also going to create some basic assets and compare those side by side between the two programs. Next, we're going to work on adding new content into Unreal as well as migrating an existing scene from Unity into our Unreal Engine project and look at what kind of assets can come over and which ones we're going to need to rebuild. So once we know that, then we're going to be bringing back interactivity to our project. We're going to look at Unreal Engine's gameplay framework. We're going to rebuild materials, reincorporate our animations into our characters, create a new character asset, as well as script custom logic using Blueprints visual scripting inside of Unreal. Then we're going to go into leveraging some of the tools the Engine has to offer, like lighting with Lumen and affecting exposure and bloom with post-processing. We'll look at modeling tools for editing some of our assets that we have imported. And then we're going to start working with audio and package our game so that other people can play what we've created. All right, so here we're looking at a comparison of our scene in Unity and what it will look like after we've brought it over into Unreal. We have an NPC character that's dancing, and the player will be able to switch what dance they're doing with the press of a button on their keyboard. This dancer is surrounded by glowing columns that have an animated material, and the color of the columns can change when the player presses a button on their keyboard as well. And then in Unreal, we've added in a new character as well as changed up the environment and illumination settings to give it a more vibey look. OK, so let's take a look and see what this is actually going to look like in Engine. So here's our scene in Unity. There we go, lovely. We have an extra package that we're using here that gives us a free-flying camera to mimic the player pawn that comes by default inside of Unreal. We'll see that when we press Space, our color of our cubes change, and the dance that our character is performing also changes up. If we press Space again, color changes back, and the dance will also go back to our original. Fantastic. Now, inside of Unreal, we're going to see something that looks very similar, except we've added a few more assets that we'll cover over the rest of the class. We've also added in a new character. We've got some music playing. But when we press Space, our dance changes and our colors change. And all of this is real-time lighting. Boom. So now let's look and see how we can take the default Unreal Engine layout and put it into this layout that more closely resembles the Unity Editor layout you might be used to. So we'll open Unreal here. First thing I'm going to do is open the Content Drawer, which is our Projects folder. I'm going to dock this in the layout here under the viewport. Then I'm going to drag this Outliner panel over here to the left of the viewport. And now we have something that looks maybe a little bit more familiar. And then again, we have our main menu toolbar up here at the top, our Play and Editor tools right here over the viewport. The Details is going to be our Inspector panel. Outliner is our Scene Hierarchy. And then the Content Browser is our Projects folder. And then finally, if you don't see your console, the output log, which is Unreal's version, can be found down here underneath your Content Browser. On this slide, we're looking a little bit at the Unreal Asset hierarchy and how different assets nest into each other. For example, you might have a world that contains different levels or sublevels or in a world partition sense. You might have a lot of different streaming assets in there. And then within those, you'll have individual actors. And then each actor can have various components or blueprints that can get more and more detailed. And then, of course, from there, you can go down further and look at nodes or even code. But this just gives you a brief overview about the relationship to each other. There's more detail about each of these in the description here, as well as in the Unreal Engine documentation. So now we're going to jump a little bit deeper into our program comparison and look at Unity Scene Hierarchy versus Unreal's Level Outliner. In Unity, the main way that I have found to keep my hierarchy organized is to use empty game objects as parents in order to group things together. And Unreal, we can still do that with empty actors. But we also have the ability to group things into folders. These folders don't actually appear in the level itself. They're only there in the Outliner. And so they're a way that you can keep things grouped together without needing to physically tie or virtually tie all of their transforms together under a parent object. Additionally, the button to add a new Engine Supplied Actor is moved from the hierarchy window to the toolbar in Unreal or the main menu toolbar. And also, there is a separate levels window. So in Unity, if you have multiple scenes open at the same time, they'll all appear in the hierarchy, whereas in Unreal Engine, you'll see all of the actors together in the Outliner. But if you want to see the different levels, the assets themselves, that'll be in a separate levels window that you'll open and can dock next to the Outliner. OK, so now we're going to look at the Inspector Panel versus the Detail Panel. You'll see they look pretty similar. We have our various components laid out vertically. But one sort of key difference to note here is that we don't have a checkbox next to the name of the cube in Unreal like we do in Unity. So if you want to disable an Actor in the similar kind of way that you would in Unity, you need to go into the rendering section of that Actor Detail Panel and search for hidden in game so it doesn't show up when you're playing it in play mode or disable the checkbox for visible if you don't want to see it when you're working in Editor. So now we're going to go a little bit deeper again on Prefabs versus Blueprints. Here we're looking at the Unity Prefab Editor. This looks very similar to the default editor layout for a scene. We have a hierarchy that can contain subprefabs or game objects, each with their own components. But all logic needs to be added to Prefabs via C Sharp script components within their sub game objects. And all of those components need to create links to one another within itself or you manually have to link them together. Over in the Unreal Engine side, we have a viewport that is similar to what we have in Unity, including the components window, which has a little mini outliner, not unlike what we get with the world outliner in the Unreal Engine level. And here you'll typically have a collection of assets like static meshes, lights, Actors of that nature. Though you can also have child Blueprints in here. Nested and containing all the complexities of that linked Blueprint. However, we certainly advise caution when doing that, as it can very quickly make the parent Blueprint more complicated and harder to work with. In the next video, we'll look at how to create basic assets in Unreal Engine and compare them to their Unity equivalents.",
