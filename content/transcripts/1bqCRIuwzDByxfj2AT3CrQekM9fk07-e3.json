  "text": " Now that we have our material created, we first need to create an instance of that material and then apply that to our landscape. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and do this now. So instead of our editor, let's hit Control Space to bring up our content browser. And then we're going to locate our matte landscape, right click on that and then go duplicate. I am going to press click on this so that I can just rename it, get rid of that matte there, just keep it as a landscape. And let's just clean that name up a little bit more. Landscape underscore. Underscore right in, ST, so instance. And then what we're going to do is we're going to select our landscape. And with that instance selected in the content browser, we're going to press this use asset and content browser. And that is going to apply that. But our landscape is going to be looking black like this, and that is OK. The reason that is looking black like that is because we need to do something in order to link the painting tool with a layer that it's supposed to represent. And to do this linkage, we're going to use something called a weight blended layer. Now, these are needed for each of the landscape layers you wish to paint. And we can apply these by simply selecting the layer and pressing the weight blended layer button, which is right next to the browse. So let's go ahead and pop over to the editor and look at how we do this. So first things first, we're going to come up into our landscape mode and you can see if I'm in paint, I have my rock, my dirt and my grass. And if I actually do try to paint, I'm going to get a warning message. So let's add and apply these weight blended layers. So we're going to just come here and go create and then select. This will give us a folder that uses the map name of our current level to store these in. And all we have to do really is just press save and we can do that for each one of these. So we're going to come here and we're going to go save and then we're going to come here and we're going to go save. Now, these weight blended assets, they have a couple of other things that we can do with them. If we want to paint on any layer, we can click on that particular layer and paint, which we'll show in a second. But we can also export these and import these from external files. We can also fill a layer, clear a layer and rebuild the materials. Now, why you'd want to import or export is if you're dealing with some type of procedural generated content in a third party application, you want to bring some of that in to say represent how dirt is coming down the mountain or where grass should be. You can bring that layer data in instead of having to paint it by hand, or you can export the current layer data out to adjust it and then bring it back in. We also have the ability to fill any particular layer, clear that layer or rebuild the materials, which will allow us to actually rebuild the uber material behind the scenes that is created with our landscape. Now, there are a few other things that I want to cover and then we'll jump into painting. So we can paint really easy by holding down the left mouse button and painting away and then holding down shift will erase. We also have the ability to smooth in between layers. So if we click the smooth tool, we'll actually kind of take that hard line that exists in between two layers and make it look like they're being smoothed into one another. So let's go ahead and come over to the editor. And one thing yours might not do this, but I want to show you how we can quickly just kind of get rid of an error like this. We can fill this layer or we can clear this layer. So I cleared it and then I'm going to right click and let's say fill. And there we go. I have that layer looking really cool. The other thing I can do is I can clear other layers that are underneath it as well. Maybe I'll just clear this entire thing and then let's try to right click and fill that. There we go. Looks like I had some erroneous data in there. So now, again, just to paint, let's select the dirt layer. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold down my left mouse button. You can see I'm going to paint some dirt in there. And then if I hold down shift, I'm going to erase the same with the grass. If I click on the grass here, holding down will paint and then holding down shift will erase that from from below it with the smooth tool. Again, what I can do is I'm going to come in here, reduce my radius and just smooth in between this. So you can see I'm kind of just smoothing out the edges or the area where this kind of starts and then intersects. So what I want everybody to do now is spend a little bit of time painting some layers inside of your project. And your goal is to have something that looks a little bit like this. So once we're done, we want to have something where we have a little bit of rock, a little bit of dirt and a little bit of grass. And just adjust the colors and things like that so that you get something that looks somewhat realistic or maybe a little cartoonish, depending on the look that you're going for.",
