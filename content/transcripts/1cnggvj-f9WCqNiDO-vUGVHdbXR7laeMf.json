  "text": " Unreal Engine 5 is a massive toolset, and knowing where the documentation lies can be helpful when looking for more information on how to use a particular feature or toolset. The Unreal Engine 5 documentation pages are quite robust, and they also cover various versions of the engine, not just the latest and greatest, but previous versions as well. If we were to pop over to our documentation, and here it is right here in a web page, we can see here these are the various versions. We go from 5.5 all the way down to 4.27. We have the ability to also look at forums. There's documentation. There is learning samples, and there are snippets. Snippets are kind of cool. They're code repositories, kind of showing us how to do certain things inside of Unreal Engine 5. Learning is going to show us our various learnings. So if we ever want to learn about something specifically, we can search for tutorials through here. Our documentation is going to be our documentation, and this is going to be split up into various higher level areas, such as programming and scripting. And then when we click on these, we're going to be able to go down and get into some more details about each one of these. And then the Unreal forums right here, this is going to offer us interactivity between developers and people on the web, as well as just getting help from your fellow Unreal Engine 5 developers. So again, the Unreal Engine documentation isn't just the documentation, but is a collection of various resources that you can use to find out more about the engine. So I highly recommend that everybody go out there and check this resource out, as it is going to help you figure something out, no matter what type of project you're building inside of Unreal Engine 5.",
