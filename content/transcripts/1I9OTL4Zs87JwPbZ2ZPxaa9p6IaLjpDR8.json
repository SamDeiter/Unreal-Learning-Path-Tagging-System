  "text": " So the last tool we'll touch upon today before closing out is creating a ray trace settings manager still using these utility widgets. So you can add a new button yourself. Again I won't go through step by step of what we did for the next camera because you're probably familiar with that by now. But you can add a new button and add some text into this same utility. You can even create your own new utility if you prefer. But we want some kind of new button that says something about ray tracing. So we'll go ahead and add that. And then you just want to make sure that this is a variable that is selectable there. So these are some custom settings that we've got here. Again it may be down to preference however you would like to set it up. But there's some specific settings that we've used. And then we want to make sure we run the utility widget and you can see that we've got some kind of setup here that says enable render settings and disable render settings. Which will essentially flip flop between the two settings. So we'll show you this blueprint scripting now. So on clicked which is a toggle ray trace button. So again we're using that same on clicked. If you don't recall how to do that you need to select the actual button inside of the blueprint and you'll get these events at the bottom of the screen. So you just want to click on clicked and that will give you this function, event sorry not function. Then you can use the flip flop functionality inside of Unreal. So just drag off the white pin, add a flip flop there. And then you can use these console commands. Now console commands will only fire when you're in editor and you can use these to test out certain things. So on the A we're using these console commands to set some form of ray tracing functionality here. We'll set the text as disable ray tracing this instance. And then we want to have on the B option similar settings but reversed. And we'll have set the text to enable. So every time we click this button it'll just flip flop between A and B. So every time you click it will go A B A B A B. And you just want to update the text of the ray trace. Again whatever you called this text variable that's why we needed to make it a variable using the little tick box. That's how you update the text there. So again quite a straightforward option but it allows you to so you don't have to keep inputting if you ever use console commands just through the opening the console in your viewport. If you're not familiar with console commands they're definitely worth digging into because you can it allows for a lot of customization over how you have your first of all render your project but also just debug options and a whole host of many things that you can do with console commands. So this is just a way to toggle between a few ray trace settings so you can see exactly what's going on and hopefully that's a useful setup for you.",
