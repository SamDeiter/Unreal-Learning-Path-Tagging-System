  "text": " In this video, we are going to go over the interface. So we will be looking at what all the different buttons do and how you can go about creating your first script. So we have opened up our blueprint here example, and you should be seeing a screen which looks something like this. Now we will go over each section here. To start with, let's have a look at the toolbar across the top here. This is going to give us some kind of idea of the functionality. So the first two buttons, which are pretty standard amongst all of them, is the save. It does what it says on the can. It just saves the file that we're working on at that point in time. The one next to it might be slightly less obvious, but this is going to allow us to browse to the associated asset within the Content Browser. So now in order to get an asset into a level, you'll often need to just drag it from the Content Browser like this. But you might not be in the correct directory, and projects can get quite complicated sometimes. So an easy way to navigate to it is just to click on this button here, and that's going to take us directly to the blueprint and allow us to drag it into the level. You will often also see them in the details panel where you're going to be able to quickly browse just from the reference in the details. Next up, you have the compile button. Now, what compiling usually does when you're working with a program is convert a piece of code into a runnable form. Now blueprints are slightly different. Mostly this is going to be doing is it's going to be doing a lot of checking to see that what we have is runnable, and then it's going to convert it into something that we can run and will work within the level. You can see that at the moment we have a green tick next to our compile and the word's good to go. So this means that this is work. This is fine. However, if I was to come into the coding section here, if I was to just add a section of code, I'm going to come off and do a create widget. And now we can see in the top left hand corner that we have a yellow compile button. And if you look at the tooltip, it says it's dirty and needs to be recompiled. So this at this point, we need to push the button to compile it. The third option is the red dot compile. This means that this has failed and there is an error in it. If you look down, you've got compiler results, you'll see that it will give you a specific message telling you what the problem is. And it will also give you a button that means that you can you can navigate quickly. So say I'm far away, you can navigate quickly to the problem. In this instance, I have not actually selected a class on this widget that I want to create. Don't worry too much about that. We'll go over that in a minute. Again, we've got the three settings and green is the good one that means you're good to go. Next up, we have difference hid. Now, this is part of the source control. We're not going to touch on this in this thing, but this is going to allow you to look at previously saved versions of of the blueprints. Next, we have find pretty self-explanatory. If it's going to bring up a find results button here and if I type in a word, it will search through the code for references to it. So if I double click, it's going to take me to the appropriate mode. OK, next up we have hide unrelated. Now, I'll demonstrate this quickly. But what this does is say I had a program that had multiple nodes, something like this. If I have hide unrelated ticked, you can see with the node that I have selected at any one time, any node which is not connected or which would not have an impact on the selected node is going to be slightly grayed out. And just delete this. Next up, we have the class settings. And this goes back to us talking about inheritance, the class settings and the class defaults. These are going to be in where you can change or reset the variables or the settings from the parent class, which you've inherited. Simulation. And this is actually hard to demonstrate without. I would just add a couple of things to the world so that we can see something. So what I've done is I've added a static mesh component for a cube and I will add a rotating movement. So this is these are just two components, actor components, which I've added in quickly to give us some functionality. If I was to now hit the simulate button, you can see within the viewport that the rotating movement is just rotating the actor within the world. So I will just stop that there. That allows you to just simulate so you can see what's going on easily within the viewport of the Blueprints. Next up are the play control buttons. And these are just exactly the same as you will find in the main screen of the editor. Now, next up, we have this drop down box here. This is no debug object selected. And this is going to allow us to view the code so that we can see how the code is working at any one time. The only problem is, in order to use this, we need to know which instance we are viewing. So at the moment, we only have a singular instance within the world here. So if I do the drop down, you can see that I have the selected example. And so I'm going to select that one. Now I'm going to add a little bit of code on to begin play so that we can see it work. I'm just adding in three delays. I'm going to make each of these one second long. And now if I was to hit the play button, well, with the debug example selected, you can see that it is giving us a visual interpretation of what the code is doing. I'll just stop that and replay. See again, we are seeing the line light up. This means you can actually watch the blueprint to see what's actually happening with it at any point in time. Next up in the top left hand corner here, we have the components panel. Now this is going to be a list of all of the different components which have been added to your blueprint. So you can see here that we have we added in the cube, which is a static mesh component, which can be viewed now in the viewport here. We also added in the rotating movement. Now this is a good example of a of a component which has no visual aspect to it. It's not a child of an actor class. It doesn't have a transform. However, the cube itself does. It just has some functionality which would be applied to the blueprint. In the top left hand corner of the components field, there is a add button. If you hear this, it's going to give you a list of all of the different components that you are going to be able to add. Below this is the my blueprint search. Now, if you've done any coding before, you'd probably recognize this to look a little bit like a header. In this, we are going to we are going to define what different events and functions and macros and variables that are connected to the coding. This will be more useful, more valuable when we actually jump into the coding section of this. Now on the right hand side, we have a details panel. The details panel is common across all of the different sections of Unreal Engine. This is a contextual menu. When you have different things selected, the details are going to change accordingly for the different settings that you've had. You can view this, for example, if I was to click on one of the components or one of the variables, we are going to get different values in the details panel, allowing us to change how they are set up. Now, in the center, we have a viewport. Now, this viewport functions very much like the viewport that we will have inside the main Unreal Engine window. You are going to be able to move around it in a very similar way. So if I hold down the right hand mouse button, I'm going to be able to change the rotation of my editor camera. And whilst I have the button, the right hand mouse button held down, I will be able to use the W A S D to move around the world to see things from a different angle. You'll find that the majority of the other keys work in this as well. You will also see that we have a number of different menus in the top left hand corner, in the top right hand corner. These will correspond to the similar menus in the main viewport. In the top left hand corner, we will have some settings so that we can change the way that this scene is displayed. And in the top right hand corner, we're going to be able to change the way we can interact with the scene. So the first thing that we've got are the different modes, the changing between selecting object, translating and moving objects, rotating and scaling. We are also going to have the snapping percentages on the right hand side. So by clicking on these buttons, you can turn them on or off to prevent the need to have to snap those numbers. You also have the camera speed, which can be also controlled by right hand mouse button and using the middle mouse button to roll up and down, speed up while fast and slow the camera moves. Now, next to the viewport, we will have two separate coding graphs. We will have the construction script and the event graph. Now, if we are to click on these, we will see that we have a number of different nodes. So this is where we're going to be actually doing our coding. Now, navigating around this is an interesting topic. So the first thing is if you want to move within these, if you place the mouse over the background and hold down the right hand mouse button, you'll see that the mouse cursor converts to a small hand. This will allow you to drag around the scene. Whilst this hand is present, you can scroll the middle mouse wheel in and out, and this will allow you to zoom in and zoom out of the code that you're looking at. Next up, we have the construction script. This functions in a very similar way to the event graph. It just fires at a slightly different time. What we will do in the next video is we're going to go over how you can create code and place nodes within the editor. We will be going into these sections in much more detail.",
