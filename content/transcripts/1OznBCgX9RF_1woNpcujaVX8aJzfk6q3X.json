  "text": " In this section, we're going to talk about some of the settings in Lumen and how to adjust them to get the best possible quality for your scene. So let's get started. You'll see here on this slide, we have an image of our post-processed volume, and we're looking at the initial global illumination settings. We're going to talk a little about these in just a bit and go back between the slides and Unreal to get a better sense of how things work and the control that you have. But we for sure will be breaking down these values so you understand exactly the power at your fingertips. Let's go ahead and go to Unreal and get things started by pulling in a post-processed volume. So one of the first things we're going to need for quality control when it comes to Lumen is a post-processed volume. Overall, when it comes to baking, also this can help with visuals, but we're going to be using a more directional, or I should say a movable light scenario, where our GI is going to update on the fly. And we're going to talk about how to actually edit some of those settings. So let's go ahead and pull up the post-processed volume. Now I can use it using the place actor tab if I wanted to, and I can go in here and choose volumes if I wanted, or I can even do a simple search. But a quick way to get there is simply clicking on the quickly add to project button here, the box with the green plus, and I can go down to volumes, look for it, or simply click once and to get content and type in post-processed volume. And voila, we have a post-processed volume in our scene. Now typically you wouldn't use two unless you're going for a particular look or several different shots. But in this particular case, I've activated one here so you just kind of get an idea of what I'm doing. One of the first things you want to do is make sure that we are set to infinite extend unbound. Lumen is OK with this. In cases with ray tracing, you want to limit your post-processed volume size to the area that you want to calculate because ray tracing is kind of expensive. But Lumen uses some of that ray tracing technology. It's a bit of a hybrid and it uses it to its advantage. So if we do turn this on, we should be fine. And it works just great. If we go back up to our initial settings, you'll see that our global illumination setting method, we want to make sure that it's set to Lumen. Now at any time, you can override what you may have already in your project settings and you have that option with the post-processed volume. We can also go in here and go to Lumen scene lighting quality. So this will give us a little bit better visuals overall in our reflections as well as just our scene in general. We also have Lumen scene detail. This is going to be very helpful too. This will help us represent our smaller objects better. And Lumen scene view distance. This is going to help us for larger scenes and looking at our range of sky shadowing. Remember, the higher numbers that you punch in here could be higher, could be at a higher or will be a higher cost for your GPU. So just make sure you keep in mind what graphics card you're using and overall what you have set up. We also have final gather. This can help reduce noise. But remember, you want to start low and then go high. We have max trace distance here also that we can calculate. And this can help for larger scenes for, you know, looking at you'll see here it says values are too small will cause light leaking into large caves while values that are large will increase GPU cost. So you really just need to weigh it. So start with the defaults and then work your way from there. And then we have scene capture catch resolution. This is a scale factor for Lumen surface catch resolution for the scene capture smaller values save GPU memory at a cost and quality. So again, weigh things with a grain of salt. And I shouldn't say that I should everything everything you do you should also just look at the big picture is probably a better way to put that. I mean, like, whatever I say take with grain of salt. You'll see Unreal is really nice as you float over and it'll tell you what it does. This is super, super great to have these hot tips in here as little reminders, because as you shuffle through all these different settings and all these different things such as materials, lighting, animation, you can get a little preview to remind you of how things work. Let's go to the slides for a minute and we're going to talk about these a little bit more detail. Then we're going to take a look at the advanced settings and what we can do to edit those. So we see here again, we look at Lumen scene lighting quality. It scales Lumen scene quality large scales cause Lumen scene to be calculated with a higher fidelity. Can be visible in reflections, but larger values are GPU expensive. So remember, always consider your GPU and the items that you have on scene. One of the things I can tell you, which is super important, you know, I hear me repeat it several times is Lumen virtual shadow maps and Nanite all work together and they give you the highest visual fidelity you can possibly get. You just have to manage your settings and your environment as much as possible. So we have Lumen scene detail controls the size of the instances that can be calculated in a scene. Large settings help smaller objects, but again, it is GPU expensive as you get higher, I should say. Lumen scene view distance set maximum view distance of the scene that Lumen maintains by ray tracing against larger values help sky shadowing and GI and larger values again can be expensive. And again, we have Lumen final gather kind of what we talked about before gives you better quality overall and it can reduce noise, but again, can be expensive. So start low and then go high. And then we also have max trace distance controls the maximum distance that Lumen should trace while solving lighting the values. Now it says values too small will cause light leaking. So be careful with those numbers. And then we also have scene capture, catch resolution scale scene factor for Lumen surface catch smaller values save GPU memory, but a quality cost. So the advanced settings that you see in there are right below where we were before. So you'll see there's a Lumen quality speed update. This will make it so that when you change your settings, they update accordingly. We also have final gather lighting update speed. This will also help so that things update accordingly. Now, as you increase those, they are GPU expensive. So keep in mind the graphics card that you have under the hood. There is like a poor man's type of, I guess you could say, exposure. It's not quite, but basically it is a diffuse boost. It can allows brightening by indirect lighting by calculating material diffuse color. So it gives you like a little bit of a, of a brightness to it. And then we also have a light skylight leaking controls what fraction of the skylight intensely should be allowed to leak and can be used for our direction to keep indoors from being too dark. And finally, we have full skylight leaking a distance. Now let's talk about these two last one here, because these two last ones here are very important to understand that they're the new kids on the block. They help with accuracy. Now in previous versions of Unreal with ray tracing, you needed to use a CVAR to be able to calculate your skylight in your interior environment. You'll see that the full skylight leaking distance controls the distance from receiving surface where skylight leaking it, it's full intensity, large values, AO effect, smaller makes a light skylight leaking flatter. So you're basically controlling those interiors. And also on the first one here with skylight leaking, you're making sure that things don't get too dark for interiors. So what I mean by that, if we go to Unreal in older versions, or I should say, if you're using ray tracing before Lumen came around, you would have to type in like skylight. And you'll see that there is a global illumination evaluate skylight and global illumination ray tracing skylight contribution. That's kind of what these two new advanced settings do. So as I turn these on, let's go back into, let me click for a second here and escape out of my output log. Output log, you thought something broke though, didn't you? That was just a interface thing. Turn on diffuse skylight leaking and full skylight leaking distance. We can control these interiors. Now you won't see a whole lot of changes sometimes when you mess with these. There might be a little bit and some of it required, depending on how close you are to a scene, how dark are you in interior, are you in an exterior, and those things will be more prominent in those particular scenarios. Now, if I bump up my final gather, now you're like, can I go higher? Now you can. Remember, you want to start low. You just have to be careful with these. It depends on your GPU and you can actually slow down your frames. And mine isn't really slowing down too bad, it's not too bad. And I removed some of the noise that was occurring here. So just keep those things in mind. So right below that, you'll see that we have reflection control. And here we can choose what kind of reflections you want. You can choose ray tracing if you wanted to and control the ray tracing reflections accordingly, or you can use a lumen. And we talked about using hit lighting for reflections and gives you higher, better quality. And you can dumb those down as you need. You can do surface catch if you needed to, but it's really important to have a good quality. And just remember the higher quality, it's going to look better in your reflective materials overall. You can also turn on high quality translucency reflections, activating high quality mirror reflections on the front layer. It translates of that translucent surface went on. Remember, it's going to cost a little bit more with your GPU. Again, the benefit of using lumen allows you to get global illumination in your reflection. Which is pretty impressive. And you didn't get that before with ray tracing. In the next video, we're going to take a look at lumen visualizers and how they work. And then we're also going to look at some tips and tricks when using lumen overall.",
