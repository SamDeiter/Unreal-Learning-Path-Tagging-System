  "text": " Now that we've set up the fingers using a custom function, we're going to explore an alternate setup that will use a couple of different nodes. The getChildren node and the parentConstraint node. So instead of using a series of set and getTransform nodes, we're going to use the getChildren node, which does exactly what it implies. It will find all of the children of a specific rig element. And in this case we'll use our hand bones to find all of the finger bones below, and again use that information to find all of our finger controls as well. So with our getChildren nodes, if I right click, search for getChildren, you can see we can input a name here, and essentially an item, a rig element, and it will find all of the children of whatever we input here. Now we do want to look for a bone, and we want to look for handL. Now I'm going to duplicate this because we want to use, well we want to find the bones for both of our hands. So if I find handR there. Now what we want to do, just to make the logic a little bit more straightforward, is add these two arrays together. So if I right click and search for add under the array heading here, we'll plug the first array in here, and then it's not add, what is it? It is append. So we want to append the two arrays together, which is just essentially tagging one onto the end of the other. So now that we have a big list of our bones underneath our hand, left and our handR, now something we need to activate is recursive. And what this will do is find all of the children of the hands children. So if I show you this as an example. Under our handR, the real children are the pinky metacarpal, the ring metacarpal, and the middle metacarpal. So essentially the parents of our new smaller chains here. And with recursive ticked, what that will do is search through all the way to the end of the chain. And making sure includeParent is unticked means we won't affect the actual hand bone itself. Now what we want to do is something called a forEach, and this will loop through each element of the array. And we're going to connect our appended arrays together to this forEach. And then we're going to create a parent constraint node. And what we want to do here is plug in our child, which will be our bones. And then our parent is going to be, it's going to come from the name of our forEach. We'll use another concat node, underscore control. So that means that for the end of all of our bone names here, we're going to add underscore control. And then inside the item of parents, we're going to drop the name in there, change that to control. What hopefully we should see, if we connect up this logic to the main forward solve, what I'll do here is just create a sequence, just to make this a little clearer about how this logic's working, just so we can compartmentalise things a little bit. And what we should see now is that our finger control actually controls our bones. So if I was to just disconnect here, just to make sure we're not seeing anything tricky, nothing works yet. And when we reconnect our logic back up, we can see that it works straight away. So that's just another way to simply connect your controls with your bones. By building all of the logic off the name of your bones, appending the two arrays together and then for each of the elements in the array, adding underscore control to the name so that we can use that as our parent inside the parent constraint, and then adding the element of the array, which is just the bone names themselves, as the child of our parent constraint.",
