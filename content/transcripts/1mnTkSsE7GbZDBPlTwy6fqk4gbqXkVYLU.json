  "text": " So, how do you build one? Well, that starts with the construction event that I briefly mentioned earlier. So what is the construction event? Again, just to cover it. Well, it's an event that we use to spawn rig elements during the preparation phase of the control rig graph. And what does this mean? So, this means that we use this event before the forwards or backwards solve logic to spawn any of our rig elements like controls or bones or nulls. And it's an event that only runs once at the start of the control rig logic. Now, it doesn't just spawn the rig elements, but we can also use it to set the initial positions of any of the rig elements that we're spawning or creating, initialize variables, update the hierarchy and importantly import the skeleton of the mesh that we're assigning this control rig to. Because as I said before, if you were to make any changes to your skeleton, the fact that you're importing the skeleton on the construction event will pick up any of those changes that have been made. And this is essentially the main tool that allows you to proceed rebuild a control rig. And without this, without the construction event, none of it would be possible. Taking a look at some of the common nodes and functions that you'd use with the construction event here, we have the spawn transform control node. Now this allows you to spawn a control and set its position and determine what the control actually looks like. So the scale of it, the shape of it, that kind of thing. So you could use this to spawn several different controls all at once with all of the same settings if you know what position that controls in and how the control looks. So you're not having to manually recreate each one and multiple times. There's also the control stack at item function, which is a function that's pre-built into the engine that is comprised of other procedural rigging nodes like the spawn node, metadata and other string operator nodes. And its function is similar to that of the spawn transform control node, but with a bit more functionality. So it allows you to add nulls above and below the control that you're spawning to add the extra level of control within the hierarchy if you need that. You can also add secondary controls as children of the control that you're spawning. And it's a little easier to do things like rename your controls with the built-in naming options. Rigs are also a new concept with procedural rigging. So they allow you to tag parts of the rig with custom names to access in the rig logic and make updates to many parts at once. So you could tag all of the bones with the name bone or all of the controls with the name control, for example, and affect all of those things at once by just finding the items with that tag. Now it's a little bit like setting a variable to access in other parts of the rig logic later. You also have the ability to set metadata on elements within the rig. So storing data on things like controls or bones or nulls. Now this is similar to tagging, but think of it more like a big container that can hold multiple data types, unlike just storing a name with the tag. So the value of the metadata that you're setting includes the name as well as the type of element for that particular part of the rig. So you can just do a bit more with that information. And it's intended to pass data from the construction event to the forwards or backwards solve logic. And there's also the concat or concatenate node. And this is useful for adding a suffix to the name of things. And we'll be using this to name our controls, to help us differentiate the names of our controls and our bones, as well as build the hierarchy of our rig.

Tags are also a new concept with procedural rigging. So they allow you to tag parts of the rig with custom names that you can then use to access in the regular rig logic and make up lots of different...

And there's also the concat or concatenate node. And this is useful for adding a suffix to the name of things. And we'll be using this to name our controls to help us differentiate the names of our controls and our bones as well as build the hierarchy of our rig. We're going to be building a simple FK rig for our character that you'll be able to use and set up for any of your own skeletal meshes in your own projects. Now let's take a look at some of the nodes that we're going to be using for this setup. Now some of them you may have used before when you're creating your control rigs, but some of them are specifically intended to be used with the construction event. So it's unlikely you've come into contact with them before. But the more of the more traditional nodes and functions, we're going to be using the item name search node. Now that allows us to essentially search for all of the elements within the rig that contain a particular name or even partial name. And this will allow us to grab lots of information at once to use to generate some controls. Now we'll also use the get transform node, which just allows us to get the transform of a particular element of the rig. And we'll use this information to set the transforms of our controls. Then we'll use the get parent node. And this just allows us to search up the chain and find the parent of a particular item, which we'll use to set up our hierarchy. And then the concat node, which is just going to help us name our controls. And a couple of functions that we'll be using are the FK chain function, which is going to connect our controls and our bones together so the controls can drive the movement of the bones. And the colourise controls function, which allows us to essentially automatically colour our controls based on their position.",
