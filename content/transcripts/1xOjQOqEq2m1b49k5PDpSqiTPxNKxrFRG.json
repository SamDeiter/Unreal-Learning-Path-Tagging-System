  "text": " Let's now take a bit of a deep dive on the Sequencer UI and talk about the different tools and features available. So when you open Sequencer, and we'll show you how to go through the Sequencer process and set up your shots and everything in a little moment here when we do our workshop. But when we look at the Sequencer window, just for your reference, we have a few different things going on here, which could be overwhelming at first. As with most softwares, you frequently use the tools that you end up using. You may not use 40% of the tools available and it's just up to your workflow. So don't let it be too overwhelming at first. There's certain things that you just get super familiar with and any kind of editing background that you may have, it could be analogous to this setup here as well. So starting at number one, which is the toolbar. We have the toolbar on the top where you can pin the different windows inside of your editor and from left to right, just to touch upon a few different things here, you can save the sequence here using this button. You'll be able to save them. You'll be able to find actors. You'll actually be able to spawn cameras inside of this sequence if you'd like. Now you can add the cameras into the level if you'd like to just place all your cameras in the level. If you know a camera is only going to be used in this sequence, you could also add the cameras here. A few other properties, there's some drop down menus here where you can change some customizable options. Feel free to just go through all the different options and you can enable or disable key snapping for example, and the increments that you want your keys to snap. Something that commonly people change a lot is by default, Unreal exports the sequences at 30 frames a second. So if you wanted to change this for 24 frames a second, for example, you may want to do that here. Now as we get into the shot process, you'll see all these shots are nested inside of this level sequence. If you set the 24 frames a second here, again, if you wanted to change it, again, if you want to leave it at 30, that's fine. But if you changed it here, it would mean that you don't need to change it inside of all the child sequences, all the shots in this example. Whereas you could actually change it to 24 frames a second inside shot 10, for example, but it would still stay at 30 on the parent track. So just something to keep in mind there. And then we also have a curve editor for any key adjustments you'd like to do. You can change them from linear to auto curve or a constant curve. That will open a new window, which you can see pinned on the top here, which is your new sequencer curve. And you can go in and edit that content to really fine tune the movement of any given actor there. So that's just an overview of the top of the sequence here. So when we look at number two, we're looking at a shot track, which houses the sequence of what order our shots appear in. We also have an audio track. And again, you can add all these different tracks from adding a track here. You can drag and drop information. Say we had a camera up in our level here and we just dragged and dropped the camera into here. We could do that and it would add it automatically into the sequencer. But if you're wanting to add a specific property, you can just go to track and add, say, an audio track or a shot track or a camera fade track. You can also select the given actor inside of the level. And again, we'll be doing this in the workshop. So I'm just trying to give an overview here, but you could select a camera actor in the level, go to track and it would know what actor you currently have selected and it would just allow it to add that. So this is where all of the actors of the scene will live. And again, an actor could be a character. It could be some audio. It could be some lighting. It could be a camera. So an actor could be anything. But it essentially houses all the controls here. Number three is where all the actions happen in. This is where you're setting the keys and maybe setting visibilities and assigning animations and adding audio and adding all your shots. And this is how you're composing your cinematics, whether it be shots, features, game cinematics, could be anything. But this is where the action is happening. And up here, you'll see a bar that shows where in the sequence you are. And you can click this and drag it left and right to scrub through this timeline of sequences here. And then at the bottom, we've got our playback controls. So we can rewind time. We can just play it real time. We can snap to the next key or snap to a previous key or snap to the start of the sequence or the end of the sequence. And if we're wanting to record any performances, you can also click record. So these are just your playback controls. And then up here is important to note that you've got arrows which are where you are in the sequence. So this will show you what sequence you're in. And if there's a parent sequence, you can go back out into the larger parent sequence or you can go forward into the nested sequence. So this will give you some sequence navigation in case you're nested in there. And then down at the bottom here is just the length of your sequence. So we can see that we're running the sequence over 2622 frames and the playback will be able to shift left and right if you want to scrub along the timeline there. So a few different useful tools to know about inside of Sequencer. But again, we'll be jumping in and creating our own three-shot setup in a short while here. When we look at the Sequencer curve editor, which is again what we opened previously. So we're in our Sequencer and we click the Sequencer curve button. This is with your curve editor. So the curve editor works within the level editor, the take recorder, all your cinematic assets. You can also use it in the Blueprints and Niagara, which again Niagara being the visual effects tool and then also Blueprints being your visual scripting, Control Rig being the animation inside of Unreal Engine and Composure, which is what you'll be using for virtual production. But essentially you can use this curve editor in many different places inside of Unreal Engine. If you're used to editing keys, you'll feel right at home here. We can also add events to the Sequencer. If we want to fire out an event, say we want to trigger a certain thing to happen in the map, say you want to, I don't know, play some lightning in the scene and you've got Blueprint setup that causes some camera flashing and some rain to start and maybe instead of controlling all that through the Sequencer, which you could do, you don't want to clutter the Sequencer and you just want to activate the lightning and the rain, you'd be able to fire out an event from the Sequencer into the world to say, I want to trigger this event. And it's slightly more advanced use case of Sequencer, but it's worth highlighting for people that want to do that. And then when we look at the take recorder, which we mentioned at the start, you can add actors to the take recorder. So we could click on a meerkat and add a meerkat, we could add the second meerkat and add the second meerkat and we could be controlling or moving the meerkats. Maybe we want to use control rig and lift the left hand of the meerkat up and block the sun out over their eyes or something like this. You can select what actors you want to record in the take recorder, hit record, record your content and then that will record it into a Sequencer you can go back and edit after the fact. So it's a very, very powerful tool. It takes a little getting your head around because it's such a new technology that the possibilities feel so wide ranging here, but we've linked additional resources at the bottom here if you wanted to check out the take recorder for your projects. We also have Live Link, which can record facial capture. So you can use a mobile phone app for this. You need a computer that runs Unreal Engine and you also need an Apple iPhone X or later with Live Link Face App installed. But you can record your facial capture performance and actually map that to a skeletal mesh inside of Unreal Engine. So if you wanted to get any facial performances, there's a very cost effective solution to do that with. And then we also have the Sequencer Live Link virtual camera, which we touched upon at the start. So again, it needs a computer running Unreal Engine. We need an iPad Pro or an iPhone X with the Live Link Vcam or Unreal Engine or Unreal Remote 2, sorry, app installed. You need to connect through the server and there's documentation on how to do all of this, but the apps are free in the App Store and you can use these as virtual cameras to move around the scene and really get a good idea about what it is that you're capturing at any given time. Now if you need an Android solution instead of an iOS solution, there is an app called And it's a stripped down version of the Epic Games virtual camera plugin. It is available on the marketplace. The app is available in the Play Store as well, but it's not a free plugin. So the Epic plugins for iOS are free. This one isn't a free plugin, but you can find additional resources down here. And if you need one for Android, that is how you would control that there. And then lastly, just touching upon the tools and features in Sequencer. We have additional resources on the Unreal Engine documentation, which you can navigate to and there's a whole host of different how-to's on there. So really deep dive inside Sequencer and get the most out of the tools that you need for your projects.",
