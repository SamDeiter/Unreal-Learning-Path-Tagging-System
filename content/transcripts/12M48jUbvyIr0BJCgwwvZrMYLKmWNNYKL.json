  "text": " Hi, everyone. In this video, we're going to go and take a look at layer materials, looking and using our old system to do so. And then other following videos, we'll look at the new system as well as the mega scans approach. So let's get started. What we're going to do is first approach looking at this older way is to be able to create two material functions and these material functions we're going to layer in such a way so we can then stack them and pull them into a material parent. And in that material parent, we'll be able to adjust things because we have function inputs in those material functions, and to get things to look and layer the way that we want. So I have a step by step in my slides, and I'm not going to walk you through these in the slides per se, but I'm going to show you actually show you and you can follow along with the slides and even look at the material samples that I have in my scene. So let's go and jump into Unreal and get started with that. So in my scene, you'll see that I have a simple material layered object here. And I also have another one that's a bit more complex. Now, this one I built a while back for Disney. And you can probably guess why there was snow. So I built this so that they could see how the layers would work with a snow scenario. And kind of rhymes, no scenario. And what I'm going to build here is a simple moss one so you can get an idea. And then we're going to do an overview of this complex layered material and another set of videos. Then later we'll look at the two other ways to be able to approach this. So let's go ahead and jump into this one. So first up, we're going to have to make a couple of material layers. So let's go ahead and go into our class folder. We're going to go to our in class material. And for this, we'll go and make a new folder. So let's go and do that. This new folder, we'll just call this vid demo. In here, let's go ahead and make a material function is what we're going to need. So you guys should have learned material functions in our other videos. So you're pretty probably vets at this point, you know, you're way around a few things in Unreal, in first rodeo. So we're going to go to this material function and activate it. Now this first material function, we're going to call this one M F underscore moss. Let's go and make another one. So I'm going to right click here, go to materials again, and I'm going to go ahead and click on material function again, click right there. And we'll call this one M F underscore. We'll call this wood. Now to keep these a bit different compared to our sample. And if you're following along, so you don't get lost and pulling the wrong one, let's go and mark these appropriately so that you can make sure you're getting the right one. So we'll call this underscore new. And we'll call this one underscore new also. Underscore new on the suffix here on the very end. There we go. So let's go and double click on our moss one. That's going to pop that up. He's off screen, so let me pull him back. And I'm going to walk you through some of the things we need to do and grab. So one of the first things we want to do, you'll see you will get a warning. This is kind of par for the course, we want to turn this off, and we can right click here and say stop preview node. And you'll see that we're going to want to and you'll see the air go away. So what we want to do here is set up our moss and get this set up so that we can control visually kind of what it's going to look like. So number one, let's do a texture sample. Give a finger the T key. Now, I recommend you do open the parameters, but you guys get the idea of how to do that. I just right click and convert to a parameter, but we're just going to keep things a little bit faster here and not worry about that. You should already know how to do that. Let's go full screen so you can see everything and get those in the right place. And let's go ahead and grab the appropriate texture that we need. So in this case, we're going to go to our details and here under texture, we're going to do T underscore and we're going to add moss. And then we should be able to get our moss albedo. There we go. So awesome. So we want to use a little bit of the power node here to do a little bit of darkening because mosque can come in pretty bright. And at least what we can do is fix that. So if we want to, again, if you want to, you can convert to a parameter, call this albedo. I'm not going to do this with every single texture because you get the idea. You should get into this habit. I'm just re-emphasizing that. And then we're going to go and do power to the power node. And then if we want to, we can go ahead and convert promote to a parameter. So we have a scalar parameter in the scalar parameter. We'll just rename this sucker to darkening control. There we go. And we'll just plug our albedo right into that base of that power node. And you can use a multiply if you want to. It's up to you how you want to tackle that. But the reason why I'm using a power node primarily is because we're going into the fuzzy shading material function. And yes, you can pull in material functions inside the material functions. Don't let that mess with your head. So let's type in fuzzy shading. This is going to give us a nice little kind of gradient, not a solid sudden change with the moss. So we'll do fuzzy shading. I'm going to pull that power node right into here. And again, you can experiment with different setups here. This is primarily what I'm going to be working with. I'm going to move my output result out farther out here. That's going to make things a little bit easier. And what we want to do is also control color. So I'm going to pull this string here, and we're going to type in multiply. Let's grab multiply areas. And in that multiply, we're going to also create a constant. This can be a three constant node. So it can be figured three key left click. There we go and choose a color we want. I think I chose like a really pukey green wasn't quite the best green in the world doesn't look like vibrant moss. This is closer to moss here. Little bit closer than I had before. I make myself giggle sometimes. All right, so we're going to go ahead and grab this and pull this into the channel there. And I'm going to pull this up right here. Again, you can promote that to variable if you want to. It can be a little bit helpful. We're not really making instances of this in this particular case. But if you were to elaborate on this a bit more, you can get into that habit. I like to get into this habit anyway. This is really up to you. Let's set that darkening though to 0.3 forgot to mention that. There we go. Cool. And now what we want to do is get into a make attributes. Let's go and make attributes. There we go. Make material attributes. And the reason why we're doing this is then this adds a little bit more customization to what we want to do and opens up all the things that we need for this look and feel. And it is a very good habit to get into in this particular workflow. Now you'll notice in the fuzzy shading, we have normal, we have core darkness, we have power, and we have edge brightness. We want to be able to make scalar parameters for that or just parameters in general. So I can right click in here and just promote this if I want to. And actually, I don't want to promote that way. We do want to promote these three. We need an actual normal connected here. So I'm going to go to the core darkness, and I'm going to say promote to parameter, pull this down, set this to like, let's think what is my setting? I think I said 0.5. Yeah, I think that's right. And then let's go ahead and promote this one. There we go. Pull that down and set this to zero for now just as a placeholder. And we'll do the same thing here. And again, you can edit these if you want to later on, brought to variable, pull that down and just leave that zero for now. Cool. All right, so we got our base set up here. Obviously, it's not going to show up. So we preview. We're not really connected yet. So we can pull that in ahead of time if you want to. And then if you want to, you can also do a preview here just ahead of time. There goes straightforward. Nothing right now about stop preview. There we go. All right, so it's going to set up the rest of it here. Let's go and hit the T key. And we're going to pull in a normal. So let's go ahead and pull that normal in. And I just have it set as called normal. That's fine. This can be any normal you want. You do want them to match though, if you can. In this case, we'll just call this T underscore normal. 2K. That should be the right one. Pull this over. And we can draw this straight into the normal. Now you can add more of those normal details like I've taught you in other classes. But for now, I'm just going to pull it right in there. And I'm going to pull it right into the fuzzy shader to give a nice little get that fuzzy shader effect in there, which will work really nice. Get a nice little almost like a built in type of you think of it as like a built in drop off and all that. So it actually works pretty well. All right, so let's get back to it. So add a few more things. Just one more, just a little bit of roughness control. So we'll do a T for texture. Again, keep finger left, click to get that T in there. And we'll just pull in some roughness. And this one is just like called T underscore. This can be any rough you want. Obviously you do want it to match the texture of this one. I just have rough 2K, underscore 2K. That's fine. And then we'll go ahead and I will keep my finger the one key. Get a constant in there, set that constant to 0.9. That seemed to work pretty well when I was playing with this. Keep my finger the M key. And then we're going to go ahead and go into the B channel. And then we'll grab this one and go into the A channel. And we'll move this in up here to roughness. Now some of the texture names may have changed in your files. I sorted these a little bit differently. So it may not be rough, it may actually be grass rough. And some of these, sometimes that makes a match. If I can't find a rough, I'll just grab something else from somewhere else. And again, you're more than welcome to do that. It's all up to you what textures you want to use, and how you want to get everything working in the right area. And I just double clicked on that string node. If you're wondering, just giving this to look a little bit less noodley and a little bit cleaner in breakdown. Cool. So you should have what I have at this point. This should be exactly what you're going for. And in the next video, we're going to go ahead and build the wood material function and get things set up in that direction. Thanks again.",
