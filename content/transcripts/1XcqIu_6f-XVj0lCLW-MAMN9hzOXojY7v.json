  "text": " In this video, we'll look at making a complex material based on our Unity shader graph. Here we see the Unity shader graph for the scrolling texture on our pillars around our dancer, as well as the logic that allows us to switch the color between the two of them. In Unreal, this looks like this. We're going to be rebuilding a lot of similar logic, and a lot of functions will have very similar names, so you should be able to follow this one a little bit more closely. So let's go ahead and jump in. We will create ourselves. We already have a stage pillar map right here, which we can open up. Perfect. And now what we're going to do first is create our scrolling texture, and then we'll add in the color. So we can do that first by getting a time node. This will give us just a counting up of game time, some output work inside of shader graph. We'll use a panor node and our coordinates, but we will plug that into time. And I want this to have the speed be set to 1, so we'll be panning our y-coordinate. And don't worry if shader math is not your thing. This isn't as important, and you can follow along and make some fun math tricks along the way. We'll be using a multiply node that we can tweak and slow down the panor speed if we want. And we'll be piping that into a texture sample. So this is where this node can be used to grab any texture from your project and apply it to a material. And we are going to use, you can see down here, the texture we want to set. We're going to search for noise. And we are going to get our, let's pick a fun one. And then we can leave that over here for now. We have this white. If we want to apply this texture sample, we can plug this in here. And we should see it scrolling along. It come back to, oh, we're in the wrong map again. Let's go back to our. We'll save that. That's OK. Go back over here. And if we want to see our material on our cube. Uh-oh. So I guess the splitting it up, I'm going to need to split it now. And get it on there. So we can see a preview of our material. So we can see a preview of our material now on the sphere to the side. If we want to see what it will look like on a cube, like the pillars we have in our scene, we can just hit the cube over here. And now we get a better idea of what we're looking at. So that looks pretty good so far. I think another thing we can do, though, in order to control how contrasty this noise is, is add in a step note. And I'll set this to 0.5 as well. This is going to make it a little more of a hard transition when we're going from black to white. This looks good. We can set this to the side a little bit more over here. Now what I'd like to do is set this color. We're going to pick this to be double click here. Say let's go, we used pink and green, or purple and green. And then another color here. We can just duplicate that with Control-D, click, and we can pick our color from before. Awesome. So in order to switch between these two colors, we're going to use what's called a LERP node, or Linear Interpolate. And so this will allow us to switch between A and B based off of this value of alpha. And again, if you want to see what this looks like, you can also right click and do Start Preview. And this will, instead of showing this output here of the final material output, it will show whatever the output of just this specific node. So this is like a blend now between our light purple and our light green. So if we want to combine this with our texture down here, we can use a multiply. Lots of multiplies, so make sure you just get the basic one for this. We'll plug this in, plug that into base color, stop previewing, and now we've got our color applied to our noise. If we put this down to zero, you can see we're all the way at purple. And if we put this to one, we're all the way to green. Awesome. We can apply this. And then in order to be able to change this color, what we need to do is make this a constant. So this will allow us to set, if we, and then a parameter, and we will call this like color one, two, two. So now change the value of this parameter, it will change the value of our material. And then one last thing for now, we are going to come down here to another multiply, and we will pipe in another parameter here, constant convert to parameter, and we will call this glow intensity. Set this to something like five, and then hook this up to our emissive color. And so now this is going to allow our material to have an effect on the Lumen global illumination system. And from here, we'll get to see our cubes and our stage pillars generating patterns as our glowing cubes are able to go from zero to one. So this is all well and good. And we can actually convert these two parameters so that they can change in material instances. And you do that just by right clicking and telling them to convert to parameters. In order to make this interactive, we're going to need a way to change the color of our, or change that number that controls the color of our cubes dynamically. There are a couple ways of changing the value of a parameter on a material at runtime. One of them is by using a dynamic instance of the material, or the other way is by using a material parameter collection. We're going to look at this material parameter collection because it's one of the unique assets and part of the Unreal Engine workflow that can be really powerful. It's designed for being able to update large groups of materials simultaneously, but we're just going to see how it works with the one here because it gives us a little bit more flexibility in our code. So we're going to be creating it in the content browser, creating a new parameter, and then we can add it to our material that we were just working on. Over here, I'll right click, I'll go to material and we see and material parameter collection. I'll call this MPC session. Color change. Fantastic. We'll open this up. We can see all we're doing is putting in a list of scalar parameters, so just one float value or a vector parameter, so an array of float values. In this case, we create one and I'll call this color change. We can call this info, and this is the default value of zero, which is fine. Now back over here in our color map or in our material, we can look for a parameter collection parameter. Specify. It's already seen that we want to get our session color change and we will grab our value for A to B, and then instead of using the parameter in the material, we will use this material parameter collection instead. Perfect. So this is going to allow us to change the value, have our other blueprints change the value here in this asset, and that will be propagated to any material that incorporates that same parameter. For this, we're going to do it in the level blueprint and then we're going to migrate it into a new third-person character. In the next video, we'll look at how the player can use their input to drive the logic of our material as well as the animation blueprint we created earlier.",
