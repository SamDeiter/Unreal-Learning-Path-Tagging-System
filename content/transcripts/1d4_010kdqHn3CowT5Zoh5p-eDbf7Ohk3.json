  "text": " In this short section, continuing our look at the Sequencer CineCamera tools, we will dive into the CineCamera Tracking tools and add tracking to the CineCamera Crane and Rail systems we built in the previous section. First, I want to point out that there are two types of tracking specifically designed to work with CineCamera Actors in Unreal Engine. The first type is Look At Tracking, which, when enabled, allows the Cinematography team to track a specified actor as it moves through a level or sequence inside Unreal Engine. Users can adjust the interpolation speed relative offset and allow the camera to roll relative to the tracked actor's movements. The second type of tracking is the Focus Tracking, which can be set by selecting the Tracking option in the CineCamera Focus method. This activates the Tracking Focus settings that allows the focus of the camera to automatically adjust based on the selected actor it is tracking. And just like the Look At Tracking, users can adjust the interpolation speed and relative offset, but the Focus Tracking also allows for users to smooth focus changes and adjust the focus offset as the tracked actor moves. Both types of tracking offer a Draw Debug Cube so that the cinematographer can locate the tracking point. Look At Tracking is a yellow cube, and Focus Tracking is the purple cube. Now let's jump into the engine and add tracking to the camera crane and rails we built in the previous section. So the first thing we need to look at is the attachment of an empty actor to the animated actor we are tracking. This is done to set the tracking point of the preferred location of the actor within the camera framing and correct any view shift that might be caused by root motion animation. Now choose either the Camera Rig Rail or the Camera Rig Crane and double click to open. From here we will add Look At Tracking and Focus Tracking to the Camera In Sequencer. This works the same way for both so it doesn't matter which example you decide to use. I've chosen the Camera Rig Crane. Now for this to work we need to have our camera selected and the tracking enabled from the Details panel. Head on over and enable Look At Tracking. While in the Details panel we can also move to the Focus section and switch from Manual Focus to Tracking Focus. Scroll on down a little, find your Focus settings, move to the Focus method and switch to Tracking. Go ahead and keyframe the actor to track in the Tracking Focus settings, as that will add the Tracking Focus option to Sequencer. Go ahead and move back up to our Actor to Track in the Look At Tracking section and keyframe that as well. This will also add those components to the rig camera in our Sequencer example. In order to track a specific actor we need to resolve our unresolved bindings. To do that you simply move over to the Actor to Track section inside Sequencer, go to the pull down menu that says Unresolved Binding and select an actor to track. For us, under the SUV Drive Crane just choose the Track Actor SKM. That will make it automatically follow the track actor attached to our SUV character. Do that again for our Actor to Track for our Look At Tracking settings and that will do the same thing. Now we should be tracking the actor in our level. Once that's set we can play the level sequence and view the results. Let's lock our camera to the viewport. Go ahead and play to see the results. Now you'll notice that I don't have the actual view in my viewport connected to my CineCamera Actor and that's because I'm actually bound to the wrong camera actor. To fix that I move up to my Camera Cuts track, right click on this and let's go ahead and change my camera. I'm going to change to my Rig camera example. Now that we've set our camera cuts let's play this one more time. Ok that's it for the CineCamera Tools sections. In our next section we will explore some CineCamera techniques starting with a look at a few of the available modification tracks.",
