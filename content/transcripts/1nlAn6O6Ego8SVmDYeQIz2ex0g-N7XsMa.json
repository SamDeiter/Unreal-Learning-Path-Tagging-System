  "text": " Now that we have our level set up with our landscape imported and a few of our actors like our lights and our fog, let's go ahead and now talk about editing our levels. And the first thing we're going to talk about in level editing is going to be camera bookmarks. Now camera bookmarks are a really useful tool that allow you to specify where your camera should be looking at and gives you a really easy way to come back to that location. Now we can access our camera bookmarks a number of different ways. The first way is through the hamburger menu here. If we click on this, we'll see our camera bookmarks and then we have jump to bookmarks 1 through 9 which we can also set bookmarks using the 1 through 0 keys on the keyboard and then we have the ability to compact, clear or clear all of our bookmarks. Now we can also set bookmarks manually by hitting control plus the 1 through 0 keys on the keyboard. And again, bookmarks are a great way to come back to a certain area inside of your level. So let's pop over here to the editor now and go ahead and set some camera bookmarks. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here maybe to like this little peak over here and then I'm going to hit control 1 on my keyboard. You can see here it says save to bookmarks. So whenever I press 1, I'm going to automatically come back right to this location. So let's go ahead and we're going to set one maybe like over here. So I'll hit control 2 and then maybe I come down here and we'll set one maybe over here. So we'll do control 3. So I've got 1, 2, 3 and again I can set these all the way until the 0 key on my keyboard and you're going to find these really useful for a number of different things. One, we can put these in areas that we know have a low FPS or low frame rate and can always come back to this to kind of check this area to make sure that our frame rate is matching our target. We can also use them to chart our levels progress. One of the cool things that you can do is let's see we come back over here to let's say 2 if I hit F9 on my keyboard. You see here I saved this screenshot. So let's go ahead and open that up really quick and we can see here this is a screenshot of that location. So again I can use these camera bookmarks to help me do things like chart my levels progress or always come back to the same location to check my levels performance to make sure that everything that we're doing inside of our level is performing the way that we want it.",
