  "text": " Okay, so in this video, we're going to take a look at nulls. And essentially, what we're going to do is build an extra head control that allows us to rotate the head like we would with an FK control, like a typical FK control. But we still want to keep the functionality of the aim control, right? And to do this, we're going to have to do a little bit of trickery and use a null to allow us to build that functionality in a way that's actually nice to use. So let's go ahead and take a look at how we do this. We've got our project here. I'm going to open it up. And we've got all the head aim setup that's happening here. Let's go ahead and I'm going to move this out of the way, the finger control setup, just so that it doesn't get in the way. Let's take a look at this, how it's set up currently. I'm going to compile this just so that we see things properly. And if we take a look at this, currently, our aim setup is done in such a way that the head bone is what's being driven by the aim node. And if you think about it, if we're going to set up a control to actually rotate the head in an FK type manner, this isn't going to really work. We're going to use the head aim from the neck bone and then the FK setup for the head will do through a typical control. So in order to do that, all I'm going to do is change what we're actually making aim here. So we're going to make the neck O2 node be the one that gets driven. And instantly you'll see an issue, right, which is that the head starts aiming up, which really isn't the desired outcome. If you understand what's going on here, though, essentially because we're making the neck bone aim at it now, the neck bone is now aiming directly at that point, at that aim control. So we're going to just apply an offset to bring that head back down. So in order to do that, we're just going to go to the primary section here and under the target, I'm going to type minus 10 on X. And you see straight away, essentially, we've made the target aiming point a little bit below the location of that control, the head of control, right? So we've straightened the head out. So now if we just move this, the head still aims at the control itself. So we've got no issues. We'll quickly compile that. So now let's go ahead and set up a control for the head so that we can control it via FK and we'll see what we can do. So to do that, I'm just going to right click on the spine control. I'm going to add a new control in there. You can see there's like a sphere control. I will rename this to head and scroll control. And I want this control to be where the head bone is. So let's go ahead and move this all the way up here, close to the head bone. And I'm just going to right click on it and set offset transform to closest bone. The closest bone is going to be the head and it'll snap the location to it. So you can see we've got our control here. As I say, it's just a sphere that's inside the mesh right now. But let's go ahead and change some drawing types so that we can see the control properly. So we're going to change the control type to a thick circle. We're going to make it yellow since it's a head control and we made the aim control yellow as well. And I'm just going to change the scale here. I'm going to make the scale three. So now we can see the actual control, but it's offset here. So I'm going to rotate it 90 degrees on Y. And now you can see I've got a head control. So traditionally, we're going to just do a very simple FK type setup for a control like this. We've done it before. But all we do is we would grab the transforms of the control and we would set the transforms of the bone that we want to drive. So in this case, we're going to set the transforms of the bone to that of the control. So get the transforms of the control, set the bone, we can execute that. So what's going to happen with this? So we can select this and rotate the head. That works perfectly. Awesome. But now you'll notice that if I try to use the aim, nothing's going to happen. And the reason is the order of operation that we have here. So you can see the aim is being performed first, but then we set the transform of the head bone. So even if we're rotating the neck here. And you can see the neck actually does work. If I just bring this here, you can see the neck is working. But because the head control is being set afterwards, the result is that it doesn't look at the object that we want it to look at. So one way to fix this would be to just go, OK, well, let's set the control of the head first and then execute the aim. So if you thought of that, that's smart. And now you can see we can move the head. But one thing you'll notice that's not very nice is that the control for the head isn't actually following the orientation of the head anymore. So I can offset the head to something completely different and still the control is flat and doesn't really react to that rotation. So that's still something that we're not super happy with because it's not very descriptive of what's actually going on. So how do we set this up? I'm going to plug the aim back in at the beginning. I'm going to take a look at a null to fix this. So a null used to be called space, a space, right, inside of control. But it's been renamed to null. And essentially, all it is is a reference to a point in space or to a space. So in order to create a null that is going to work for our purposes here, I'm going to once again on the spine control, right click and create a new null. And this is going to be the head null. And it's nice if you type things correctly. There we go. And this head null, which I can't see, actually, but also I can't move it. So in order to see the null itself, I'm going to go here in my viewport and display nulls. And now you can see I've got a null. But you can see it's not something that I can select and move. It's not like this control, which I can just I have a gizmo to work with. My null has none of that functionality. So we'll get a node that actually sets it up in the correct place. So to do that, all I'm going to do is just like we normally do, is set the transform of the null. To be where whatever the transform of the head is. So we get the transform of the head bone and we set the null to be that. So the null will always have whatever space and rotation the head actually has. So if we set that up now and we move this around, you can see the null actually updates with whatever the bone is doing. Awesome. And now all we need to do is make sure that the head control follows that null. And then we can just set our transforms on the head just like we did in the past. So how do we do that? Because if we just connect this, we're going to have the same issue as before where, OK, well, the null is updating, but the head control isn't. And all we need to do really to fix this is make sure the head control is a child of that null. So that whenever that null rotates, the head control goes with it. So I've made the head control now a child of the null. And now as I move around, you can see we've got our aim control and our head control actually follows along. And we can rotate this and have essentially an offset from our aim with the correct setup. So that's how you use a null to perform this kind of action. So now to tidy all this up inside of our rig setup, I'm just going to make a new comment on here. I'm going to call this one head control. And just after this, we'll go back to making or to doing all the finger control goodness that we set up earlier. So everything's set up correctly now. And we've used the null to essentially offset the transform of the space of a control so that it gives us the functionality of both the aiming and offsetting the rotation of the head itself. Cool. We'll look at some other types of controls after this.",
