  "text": " So, starting with getting your project to compile and the options available to us, there's several different configurations that we can use by default and several different targets. So, configurations on the left, targets on the right. So, we have debug, debug game, development, test and shipping. Debug essentially means that both the Unreal Engine itself and your games code will both be completely unoptimized. So, for the most comprehensive debugging experience, obviously that means that affects performance and load times. Debug game, very similar, but only your games code will be unoptimized and will just optimize the actual Unreal Engine code as normal. Development is the kind of default configuration that most people on the team would be using, certainly non-programmers. This is essentially, most of the code is optimized. This allows for some amount of debugging, but it will, your load times, your performance will be a lot improved. So, for people who actually don't need to be looking at the code, they'll typically be using this configuration. Test is allowing most optimizations, but it will keep developer tools and the ability to kind of use console commands in the various targets. Shipping is everything is fully optimized, no profiling tools, no console commands allowed. So shipping is the game as it will go to the public. Then we have our targets. This is essentially where that code is going. What is the kind of like receiving product for this code? So, client and server, relatively obvious. It's intending a build specifically for the client of the game or a server. Editor is again the kind of default one. This is building your actual game in the context of the Unreal Editor. It's worth highlighting that each of these has pragmas that link to it. So in on client mode, we have with client and code inside the with client code pragmas will only be executed on client builds. The same with server code. But in editor, both with client and with server are always true. So editor kind of has both of those as true. It treats itself as both client and server. Game that is the kind of last target and that is the first two are both true. Game is the kind of standalone single player version of the game. So if you're making a multiplayer game, it's unlikely you're going to be using the game target. But if you're making a standalone game, if you're creating a package of your game, your game is like a single player game, that's the target you would be using. Both client code and server code pragmas would be true in that situation. Both of those things are true. But obviously, editor isn't true in that case because you're not shipping that with the editor. One last thing to touch on as well is that test and shipping. Neither of those configurations can be used in conjunction with editor. So tests and shipping configurations are expressly intended for actual like packaged versions of your game. Just quickly touching on the Unreal editor itself. It's a lot more than just a scripting tool. It's not just for level designers to come in, create levels and do a little bit of scripting. There's actually a huge range of comprehensive features that would be far too, you know, it needs its own presentation just to say even touch on all the stuff that the editor provides. But there is a lot of functionality there for every discipline. As programmers, it's got a lot of powerful debugging tools. Blueprint itself is kind of an important skill set to add to your tool belt. So we'll touch on that a little bit more in a second. And also one of the really, really powerful things is it provides you a way to actually test if you're doing a multiplayer game or yes, either online multiplayer or even local multiplayer game. It gives you a really, really easy way to test your game in a multiplayer environment on a single device. I'll actually just quickly demo that. We just go to an example project I've created. A different session will explain kind of more of an introduction to the editor itself. So you just have to kind of believe what I'm doing. But I can just change the number of players this game is going to demo. So if I just played like this, you can see I'm just kind of like a single player running around, not super compelling gameplay yet. But if I want to just demo what this game would be like with two players, I can literally just change this number here. And now I have a two player game. I have two separate versions of the game. And if I had a character model, you would literally see both characters and you'd be moving around in real time. But I can also switch from that. That is the equivalent of doing like local multiplayer. I can also suddenly switch to multiplayer mode. And you can see I've created a little widget here in the top left that demonstrates that this screen is actually on the server and this screen is on the client. And so you can really, really easily debug network replication issues and understand exactly how a client and a server would be communicating information and issues that might come up in a kind of networked multiplayer context. So a really, really powerful tool to be aware of from the off, as well as, like I said, the debugging capabilities and the use of Blueprint. Yeah, again, worth highlighting that projects can be written in both C++ and Blueprints, even if you're using the Epic launcher version. So you don't have to download the source version of the engine to use C++. You can do C++ and Blueprints in any context. But if you do want access to the source, it is freely available via the Epic Games GitHub. So by default, you get engine through the Epic Games launcher. That is you can see but not debug the Unreal source. So when you go to download a version of the engine, it'll look something like this. You have this option here to download the engine source. You can download the symbols for debugging, sorry, but you can't edit the engine source code. So if you actually need to be able to change some things about the way the engine works, that's absolutely fine. But you will just need to download the engine from the GitHub just to quickly demonstrate what that looks like. I've actually got it in the second window over here. You can just visit github.com slash epic games slash Unreal Engine. And this is the repo for the Unreal Engine. The source version. We've got tags for every release going all the way back to some time before I even started. Yeah, for Unreal 4.0. So really, really comprehensive, amazing tool and a really good way to say you're on version 5.5 and you need to pull some functionality back. You can actually jump to changes that were made on 5.6 and look at all those changes and how they are made and maybe pull some of those functionalities back if you want to stay on the same engine but pull back some more recent changes. Just a little bit of highlighting that if you do want to have access to the source version of the engine, you will need to connect your GitHub account with your Unreal Engine account, which doesn't take very long. You can also access the source version of the engine through the Unreal Engine per force, but that is explicitly for Unreal Engine licensees. So there's a couple of extra steps required there, but the GitHub is freely available to everyone.",
