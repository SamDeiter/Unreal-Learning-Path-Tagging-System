  "text": " Next, let's take a look at the user interface for the LiveLink VCam to better understand some of the options available to us as we start to use this interface. Now the interface will look different depending on whether you're using, say, an iPad or an iPhone, but the core features will be all here. So some of the elements we have available to us include the application log, kind of your standard output log in Unreal, to the device system stats, which will include things like our aspect ratio and our bitrate and our timecode. We'll see the ability to disconnect from the session and go back into our standard Unreal Engine editor. We can see our camera stats, in this case, 18 millimeters, and a 16 by 9 aspect ratio also translated as 1.778. Over here, we can see our aperture stats, including our ISO, which is set to auto, a focal distance of 1000 meters, and an f-stop of 2.8. The little camera icon over here will tab out to give us additional camera settings, similarly with tools over on the right side. And for 9 and 10, we have a virtual joystick system, not unlike the default touch interface that you'll see when developing a mobile game. This is set up so that the left joystick will move us on the xy-axis, and the right joystick will be for boom and pan. We'll see this in action in the next lesson. A few other elements to take note of, we have, of course, our viewfinder in the middle. We have the ability to add bookmarks if we would like to snap easily to different camera points in our bookmark manager. We have our playback controls, which will look familiar to anyone who has used the sequencer or cinematic viewport, although with the touch interface, we can actually scrub our finger along here to also move forward or backward in time. 15 is our record button, very much like the take recorder. 16 shows our axis scale, more about that on the next slide, and our stabilization stats. We can tune this up or down depending on how much camera shake we want to have. We have our tilt pan and roll degrees, just to get a sense of the current rotation of our camera. And lastly, over here, we have the name of our slate and the sequence frame that we are currently on. More information, as always, can be found in the Unreal Engine documentation. Here we see some of the additional options we're presented with when we open up our camera toolbar as well as our tools toolbar. Axis scaling is very similar to the world to meters scale setup for anyone who's worked in virtual reality, because this allows you to essentially change how your physical movement will translate from the real world into this virtual world. If you want to be able to cover a lot of ground very quickly by moving your iPad around and using the AR features to cover more territory, you can dial up the axis scale to be able to cover more ground. Or if you would like more subtle movements, you can bring that down. You can also set the value to zero in order to lock and play with dialing these up or down with your fingers on the left and right side. So we have the axis scale on the left and the joystick movement gain, joystick rotation gain over on the right. Over here, we see some of the dials that give us additional access to our camera controls. So our lens control for a lens preset on the inner dial and the focal length on the outer dial. We have the right dial allowing us to adjust our f-stop as the inner dial and our focal distance as the outer dial. And then over here, we have our film back control to select any presets we might have like 16 by 9, for example, or other aspect ratios. Continuing down here, we have the ability to adjust our ISO and exposure control. And then we also have our f-stop out here on the right here. We have our exposure compensation so we can dial the perceived brightness of the world up and down here allows us to adjust our near clip plane, depending on how close we want to be able to get to objects before they start to clip out of existence. A couple more key features to draw your attention to include the reposition button, which basically allows you to lock the camera in one spot and then you can physically move in the real world without changing that position. This is great if you are restricted in your physical movement but actually want to cover a larger space. Same idea can be done with tilt. For example, if you want to have a very severe Dutch angle that might be harder to achieve in the real world and you need to dial up that rotation depending on your physical movement or just get yourself in a more comfortable physical position while having a potentially more extreme angle. Next up, we'll look at filming a shot with the V cam and then insert that shot into an existing sequence.",
