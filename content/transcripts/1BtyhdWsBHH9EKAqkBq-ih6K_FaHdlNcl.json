  "text": " Now, as I said, we're going to be picking up where we left off in the introduction to Control Rig. If you remember, in the introduction to Control Rig course, there were some flipping hand issues when we mirrored the setup from the right side to the left. And due to some math issues under the hood, there was a function that we can actually use to take care of some of that math, as well as some other nice features. You may not need it all the time, but this function was created to make the workflow easier. Now, what is a function? Well, think of a function as a wrapper or a container of multiple nodes put together so you don't have to build out a complex node structure, simplifying things in your whole overall node. You could also think of the functions as a Russian nesting doll. Some are simple with a few levels, while others, you will find, may have more and more nested functions and nodes, becoming very complex. So this does help to simplify things visually. We're going to go over the IK2Bone function in order to fix our flipping hand issue that we had from the previous introduction to Control Rig. Let's take a look at that. So here is a function. Now I'm not going to get into what a function is per se at this point, as we will be building our own function later. However, this is the IK2Bone that is like so many other functions are within Unreal that are built to streamline your process of building your Control Rig. Now here's the simpler setup that we're going to use. Now I do have one in the project itself that has all the settings that you will require, but this will give you a nice layover here of the template here of what's going on. And we'll be able to clean up our node system. So it'll be fewer nodes in a much cleaner way. Let's go ahead and hop right into there and take a look at our project. So as you saw, there's a class start, also be a end that will be in your final project. So let's go ahead and start with the start. Just double click to get into there. And you'll see the original had the basic IK with the flipped hand. So let's go ahead and focus out and see this. See the hand is flipped backwards. That was due to some internal math, nothing that anyone did improper. We're going to fix that. So to do that, we're going to go ahead and delete the basic IK and these two transforms, remove those out of your system. We're just going to grab the node itself. You don't need to grab the comment field at all. Just slowly connect this right into here. It's you executes. We're going to hit compile and save. And I notice it doesn't flip, which also knows a few things. One is we were able to build this system with merely one function. The reason is a lot of these nodes rely or inside of this function. So it streamlines our process. But you'll also notice there's this line leading from the elbow to the control that we had for the pole vector. And that is seen right here is the line thickness. So if you wish to adjust it, you can just by entering a different number. So the other thing you'll notice is we have fewer nodes. So this saved us time and building. So the idea in control work is to streamline as much as you can. And you'll get familiar with that the more and more you build within the engine. Let's go ahead and move on to our next process, which is we're going to build a function of ourself and build some really cool tool sets. So let's get started with that.",
