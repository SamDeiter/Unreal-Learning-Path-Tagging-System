  "text": " Hello and welcome to course 119.01, Introduction to Procedural Content Generation. This course and all of the included project files are going to be based in Unreal Engine version 5.6. So what are our goals for this course? So at the end of this, what we would like you to do is have a good understanding of how the PCG or procedurally generated content system within Unreal works. And so you've got a good foundation for creating your own procedural laid out levels. So for that, we hope that you understand the concept of programming in a procedural manner. It's slightly different to the standard sequential programming that most people think of, where a lot of stuff is going to be happening at the same time. We're going to be working with things called points a lot. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to do a reasonably long exercise where we're going to populate an environment based on a PCG logic. Then what we're going to do is we're going to add a spline in and that's going to allow us some level of control of how we want things laid out, having everything populate around it automatically. Finally, we hope you get a good idea of the understandings of the limitations of the PCG system. And so you've got a good idea where you can use it and where it's probably not appropriate. Now, in order to use the procedural content generation, we are going to need one plugin really. And that is the procedural content generation framework. Now, if you don't have this switched on within the plugin settings, you're not going to see any of the classes or the graphs, so you're not going to be able to use it at all. On the project that we've provided, it's automatically turned on, so you don't need to turn it on. Just be aware of it for future projects. We are also turning on one more plugin, and that's the procedural content generation framework geometry script interrupts. Now, this is not essential, but what it allows us to do is it allows the PCG graphs to communicate with our geometry scripting system, which is a bunch of functions and tools which will allow us to edit, manipulate and create meshes within the engine. So it is useful as a go between between these two systems. Before we start, I'd like to talk about two different concepts, which are sort of important as we're going forward. And these two concepts are points and point density. Now, when we're working with the PCG, we'll start off in first by sampling the world. We can be looking at the world around us and off the back of that we are going to be generating a number of different points. Then a lot of the work that we're going to be doing is going to be about manipulating these points, changing their size, space, filtering out some and moving some around. And then finally, we're going to do something with these points. In this example, we're mostly going to be creating a static mesh instance, which are optimized versions of static meshes so that they can sort of appear in the world and not weigh down the system too much. So 90% of the time, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be changing the data on points based on some kind of logic. Now, all of these points can contain something that's called attributes. And so attributes are just data which is on the points. And these data can be anything for the obvious, that's the transform of the points, so where it is in space, location, rotation and scale. But then it can be other elements, things like its color, density, steepness, and we can also find a lot of user, user specific attributes. So it's important to understand that we have points and that attached to these points are a number of different attributes that we are going to be playing around with or using. And then at the end, we use the final points in order to spawn and create things within the world. But we have points. And as you can see here, you see these cubes on the image that we have in front of us. These are visual representations of the points that we have. So that's useful. Now, the second point that I want to get across, same term, is point density. Now, if you look at all the little cubes that we have in the world, they all have a different shade of gray going from white to black. This is a visual representation of the value of point density. Now, what point density is, is this is going to be a value that we can use to do things like filter. But by having it, by passing it in and out of the point density value. So, for example, we will pass the steepness of the points into it. By passing a value into it, we're going to be able to visually see it on the debug screen here. So we'll have a good idea of what it will look like. Secondly, we're going to be able to pass it into other nodes. So we've got a lot of nodes that work with density to allow us to do things like filter. So this is a value which we're going to be passing into the point density on specific points. We're then going to be able to see what it looks like. We're then going to be able to use that in future calculations. So it's just a catch-all attribute we'll be passing values in and out of. So next up, if you fire up the project, you should see something that looks a little bit like this. Now, we have a specific little node that hopefully will pop up when the project loads up. Now, what this is going to allow us to do is this is going to allow us to move through the project. And it's going to help us to move to the correct nodes that we have, the correct assets that we have inside the asset browser. So, for example, here, I push to the beginning, it's going to take us back to this beginning point here. Now, what I usually do with this is I'll drag this up and drop it at the top here and move up the thing so we can just see the top of it. We've still got a vision of the world outliner and it'll allow us to move back and forth through the project as we are working. The other thing that's worth noting is we have a finished directory. And within that finished directory, you're going to find that we have the finished assets that you are at any point you can come in and just have a look at. So if you get stuck, you can come in and look at what we're ultimately building up and it's commented. We should have a good idea of what we're working with. OK, so if you got stuck in the finished directory, you should be able to find a finished version of the exercise. OK, so that should be everything for the first video. Now we'll be able to jump into the project and start on the first exercise where we will be using a PCG to create a forest and then playing around with editing it. So thanks a lot. I'll catch you in the next video.",
