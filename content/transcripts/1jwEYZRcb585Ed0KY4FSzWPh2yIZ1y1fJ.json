  "text": " Hello and welcome to the game packaging and publishing course in Unreal Engine 5.6. Now it should be noted that a lot of the things that we're going through today can be covered in a lot of different Unreal Engine versions. This isn't just Unreal Engine version 5.6. Maybe some of the UIs might change, but overall the principles should remain. So it's kind of an Unreal Engine agnostic engine version today. Today we're looking at packaging and packaging inside of Unreal Engine really couldn't be easier. Unreal Engine makes it very easy just out of the box to package your game and deploy it into an executable. So to do this we can just click platforms at the top of your editor screen. You can see the platforms icon at the top of this image here. And today we'll just be packaging for Windows because that's the most straightforward for the purposes of today's tutorial. But any other devices that you have linked to Unreal Engine will appear here. And you can go ahead and highlight Windows and click package project. And when you click package project you'll be told to pick a destination. You could just call this your desktop or somewhere else. But once you have picked a location to package your project, you'll see an icon like this appear in the bottom right hand corner of your editor screen. And it'll just go ahead and say packaging project for Windows. And depending on your project it could take 30 seconds, it could take five hours or anywhere in between. But suffice to say I'll be working in the background to package your project. So now is probably a good time to go and get a little drink, wait for the project to package. And then hopefully you'll get a little green tick and that's it, we're done. So I mean you package your game, it'll be a deployable executable. And I mean that's the course complete. So a really nice short tutorial video. Now of course things aren't always as simple as that. And although Unreal Engine does make it very user friendly just to package your game out of the box, we do want to learn a little bit more about packaging and also publishing our game. So let's dig into that a little bit more. So today it'd be nice to cover these three key areas. And it just so happens they have some nice alliteration with P's going on. So we'll be covering the projects, the packaging and the publishing across today's class. And just exactly what goes into each of these sections. Of course I've provided some links to skip to each section. So if you're trying to just locate a specific area, feel free to just click the link and skip to the section that you're looking for. Now we want to start with our project settings. And project settings allow you to customize your project. So I'll show you in a second where you actually find the project settings. But just to start off with explaining a little bit about what they are. Here we could just customize our project essentially. So we can change maybe our project's thumbnail, which we'll talk about at the end of this course. Maybe you want a little splash movie to play at the start of your game project. You may want to edit input configurations here. If you weren't using the enhanced input system, this is where you'd add basic inputs. Maybe you want to choose which map or level to load on startup. All these things can kind of be found in project settings. You can also edit project settings from the configs folder. So if you were looking at an Unreal Engine project folder on your desktop, for example, you'd see a few different folders there. Might say content, config, binaries, things like this. It's where your little blue U project icon lives. So in that config folder are actually settings that you can edit directly in a notepad. But editing these can be more user-friendly in Engine. So it's just a way to get to the desired result of what you're looking for. But essentially the project settings can be found under your edit button. So if you click edit at the top of your editor window, go down to project settings. This is where we'll find a whole host of project settings. Now project settings, you can see already from the scrollbar on the left-hand side of the image there, there are a lot of project settings to find. And we won't go into every single one today. You'll get to know the few that you end up editing on a frequent basis. But it's suffice to say at the top in the project setting, there's a lot of good just customizable options just for packaging and publishing your project, which you may want to look through in your own time. Now the handy thing about project settings is there's a nice little search bar at the top of the project settings window. So you can just search any term or name of something you're looking for. And the search bar will hopefully bring up the thing that you want to edit. So if you're wanting to set up some AI navigation maybe or changing the global illumination settings or the way physics are handled in your project, all these can be found in the project settings. And you may just want to search a few terms just to see if what you're looking for lives in the project settings. Now by default, as you saw at the very start of the tutorial here, and of course we'll go into more details about actually setting up the packaging behavior of your game. But you'll have noticed that if you did just try running through the very quick exercise of just going through packaging, go and making a cup of coffee and coming back, hopefully again, will package correctly. And if not, I've got a few tools and tips of how to ensure that your game does package. But by default, we saw that Unreal Engine packaged everything by default. So it does take the kitchen sink kind of mentality of just grab everything, try its best to package it and put it into an executable. Now, this is intended behavior. It makes it easy to get your games up and running without too much engine knowledge. But it's worth noting that it can increase package sizes and download sizes, therefore. So you just really want to think a little bit about what you're actually packaging in your project, especially if you've got a few different like prototypes going on and some you know, just sample behavior that you don't really want in your main package project, but it's just there hanging around. You may just want to think about what you're actually trying to include in the package. Now, go into this tool on the right hand side a little in a few more slides, but this is called the size map. So you can actually right click on any assets inside of Unreal Engine in your content browser. And you can select size map and decide again, you can search in the right click bar as well. Just to if you can't see the size map option, it might be hidden under asset actions. But you can see the multiple elements make up any kind of given actor inside of your content browser. So here we might have a static mesh, for example, and the static mesh has a material assigned and a few textures. And you'll see that each one of them adds size to our package project. So you really want to be mindful about what you're packaging to kind of create the most efficient download size for your end user. So it's just worth noting about this, this kind of kitchen sink approach of including everything when packaging.",
