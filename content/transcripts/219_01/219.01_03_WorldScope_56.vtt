00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Hello, and welcome back.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.359
Our goal for this class is to break down how to assess scope when developing our environments

3
00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.000
for virtual production.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.800
We will also be learning how to import FAB or Quixel Megascans, free fabricated assets

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000
into the engine.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.559
Let's get right into it.

7
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.000
So if you're here, it's probably because you're looking to expand your knowledge in

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400
world building, specifically in a virtual production setting.

9
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.799
Before diving into the engine and starting to design our environment, it's important

10
00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.679
to assess the implication of working with a real-time engine.

11
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.439
Because a lot of the steps happening sequentially in a traditional pipeline would actually

12
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:46.079
evolve organically when working in real-time, and a real engine will allow you to alleviate

13
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.119
a lot of the heavy lifting in that matter.

14
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.679
You'll be able to see the changes in a snap immediately apply to your environment as you

15
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.679
move along.

16
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.399
So after understanding what real-time really means, we need to assess the scope of what

17
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.039
we're aiming to create in our virtual set.

18
00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.799
So how much work would that actually involve?

19
00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.480
I'm gonna give you a hint.

20
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.920
Something that would help us would be to create for ourselves an asset library, basically

21
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.560
collecting all the assets we expect to be using in our environment based on our story

22
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.039
and overall our direction.

23
00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.640
You can ask yourself questions like, which feeling are you trying to recreate with your

24
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.400
environment?

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.120
And which composition would best pick that?

26
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.360
Pre-production and production tracking are essential steps of both traditional but also

27
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.400
real-time productions.

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.640
So make sure to take your time and have everything ready before diving into environment design

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240
in Unreal Engine.

30
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.400
So once you have an overall idea, have collected a good amount of references and sketched out

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.120
your intentions with detailed concept art, you can start breaking all of this down into

32
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.359
an asset list.

33
00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.040
You wanna make sure to flag out the assets that would be the longest in focus in your

34
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.280
composition.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.540
Those assets are typically referred to as hero assets in production terms.

36
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.120
In our environment, hero assets will probably hold the highest level of detail or resolution

37
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.280
in our map.

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.719
Once you have an asset list, you can start importing or migrating all the assets you'll

39
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.000
be using to develop your environment into the engine.

40
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.280
If using asset packs, you might want to delete assets you wouldn't be using and just keep

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.099
those that you would.

42
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.080
This will prevent your project size to overblot with unnecessary items.

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.319
Keep in mind that sometimes it might be good to keep similar assets or textures within

44
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.719
a pack at your disposal to create nice variations in your design and not to make it look too

45
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.800
repetitive.

46
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.560
Once everything is imported into the Content Browser, it's a good habit to create a test

47
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.640
scene with all your assets aligned on the floor to get a clear overview of how they

48
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.800
look like and whether there are any migration issues.

49
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.920
When working with external assets, whether modeled and textured by yourself or not, there

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.840
are a few things to consider.

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.319
First, you wanna make sure those assets are to scale and share the same scaling system.

52
00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.439
Remember that centimeters are one-to-one to unreal units.

53
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.639
Your assets are your friend.

54
00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:22.000
The more you build items into separate pieces, the easier it's going to be to A. Create variations

55
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.560
and B. For unreal to swap different level of details based on the distance of thus separated

56
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.639
objects from the camera.

57
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.840
Try not to scale objects that are relatively small and have nanite enabled, rather enlarge

58
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.280
them into a separate DCC and then migrate them into unreal.

59
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.800
If you merge different assets with nanite enabled in Engine, you might add heavy calculations

60
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
to the editor.

61
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.159
This is relevant for games but also for virtual production, since the environment displayed

62
00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.479
on the LED screens should run at a minimum of 60 or 30 FPS.

63
00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.920
Lastly, when using Lumen with thin assets, you could experience light leaking and shadow

64
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.360
artifacts, so make sure to add some volume or depth to them to prevent that.

65
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.280
Alright, let's have a look at the Fab plugin directly in Engine.

66
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.120
Alright, so you could have any project opened up here in the editor, but just make sure

67
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.560
to go under Edit and Plugins and check that the Fab plugin is enabled as well as the Bridge

68
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
plugin if you wanna use Quick Fill Bridge.

69
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.480
Today, we're gonna be focusing on Fab only since it contains all the mega scans already.

70
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.800
So you can access that either by the QuickCAD menu down here and then clicking on Fab, or

71
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.040
by clicking on the Add button in the Content Browser and then clicking on Fab.

72
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.319
So the Fab window will open in its default homepage, which will display some featured

73
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.160
Unreal Engine products as well as some Quixel products down here, some UE samples that are

74
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.600
free and you can just download and explore and play around with, some MirrorHemant content

75
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.879
and then some extra content down here.

76
00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.600
Here on the left, you can see some different categories you can filter your asset through,

77
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.000
like 3D assets, Materials, Sprites, Decals and more.

78
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.960
And if you ever get lost into a rabbit hole just like filtering through assets, you can

79
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.240
always just click here to go back to your homepage.

80
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.720
Now when looking through assets, you have a few filters at your disposal.

81
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.000
You can filter through the style, so the rendering style or the period and theme of your asset.

82
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.840
You can also check out the compatibility if you're developing for games, some technical

83
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.400
features like whether they're animated or rigged, whether those are blueprint assets,

84
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.160
they're compatible with Nainite or more.

85
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.080
Some formats, if you want them to be compatible with Metahemons, and then you have some more

86
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.599
filters down here like the tags, the price and more.

87
00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.439
You can sort them by relevance, rating or other priorities.

88
00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:06.000
And then here, something that could be relevant for you guys is that if you click on these options,

89
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.120
you can choose whether you want to show or not products created with artificial intelligence.

90
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.439
You can also choose whether you want to hide, blur or display mature content.

91
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.399
Okay, then if I wanted to filter through Megafkind's asset only, I could do it by searching through

92
00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:33.199
Quixel and then switching my view from products to publishers, and here you would find the Quixel

93
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:41.279
products. Now these products need to be purchased, but if you filter through free assets down here

94
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.879
by clicking on price and then flagging the free checkbox, you will be able to see only the free

95
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:52.480
Quixel assets. If you wanted to filter through Megafkind's only, you can just type Megafkind's

96
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.199
in the search bar, and this will show you results from the Quixel publisher only titled Megafkind's.

97
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.000
So you will be able to find all the Megafkind's assets.

98
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.159
Now for today, I had something specific in mind to download, which is a chicken nugget.

99
00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.639
So if I search for chicken, I will be able to find my chicken nugget down here.

100
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:19.519
That was also wishlisted by me. So if I click down here on the right icon right next to my library,

101
00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:26.399
I'll be able to find my wishlist and I can find my chicken nugget. If I wanted to, I could also

102
00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.839
remove it from my library, which I'm going to do right now. And then if I go back one tab,

103
00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.800
I will be able to find my chicken research again and wishlisted again if I wanted to.

104
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.360
So if I click on this chicken nugget, I will get access to some further details on this asset.

105
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.319
So down here, you can choose the quality you want to download this asset in, whether you want it low,

106
00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:56.240
medium, high, or low, which is uncompressed. Make sure to choose the resolution of the assets you

107
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.960
download wisely based on your environment composition. So if this chicken nugget was going to be a

108
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:08.719
hero asset, I will probably download it as raw or high quality. But if it were an asset far in the

109
00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:13.519
background that would be seen really small in the camera, then I'll probably choose something like a

110
00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:19.759
low quality. Okay, so if we scroll down in our asset details, we can find here some included

111
00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:25.519
formats. Right now you can see that I don't have access to the UF add or the C brush formats,

112
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:32.799
because we're within the Unreal editor. But if I click on FBX, I can find some details on the

113
00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:38.719
total amount of triangles and vertices, as well as the overall size of this asset and the textures

114
00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:44.879
that it will come with. All right, so now that I've chosen my asset, as well as the quality that I

115
00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:51.519
want to download it in, I can just click on add to project. My asset will be downloaded.

116
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:58.639
And then Unreal Engine will open my downloaded asset directly into the content browser. So if I

117
00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:03.519
double click here, I will find my static mesh, and I can open it up if I wanted to.

118
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:09.600
All right, let's go back to our slides for a moment. All right, so when importing external assets from

119
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.240
FAB, you not only want to make sure to download the correct resolution, but also set up your level

120
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.240
of detail wisely, because this could have a high impact on your scenes. Now, if you're using Nanite,

121
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.039
things would be a little different, and we'll be talking about it in the next video. If Nanite is

122
00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:33.519
disabled, the LOD would swap based on the distance of the object from your camera. You can see here

123
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:38.559
in the slide, I outlined a few steps that you can take to customize the level of detail of your

124
00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:44.159
asset. Let's go back to the engine and see this option in further depth. All right, first of all,

125
00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:49.599
by right clicking on any static mesh actor in the content browser, we can check up here whether Nanite

126
00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:56.559
is toggled on or off and disable it if we wanted to. Now, this chicken nugget has only one level

127
00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:02.319
of detail, so it wouldn't be a good example to show you how to set up different LODs. So I'm going

128
00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:08.159
to close it down and then just click on this rock here in my environment. And then in the details

129
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:13.919
panel, I will just double click on the assigned actor to open the static mesh editor up. And here

130
00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:20.079
we can see our boulder. Now, in the details panel, I can see that Nanite is enabled on it. So I'm

131
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:25.919
going to disable it just to get access to the different LOD options and to show you. Now, under

132
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:32.319
the LOD picker section, you can see that LOD is set to auto. This means that if I distance myself

133
00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:39.120
from the object with the camera, the different LODs will automatically swap to optimize my viewport.

134
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.479
And you can see as I go back with my camera that the current screen size of the object will decrease,

135
00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:51.360
as well as the fallback triangles and vertices. Now, if you wanted to, we could force the editor to

136
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.240
use just one specific LOD we have here at our disposal. The LOD zero would have the best quality

137
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.159
and the LOD four would be the most optimized. So if I switch this to all LOD form, you can see that

138
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:13.200
my fallback triangles lower to 600 and vertices to 500 compared to an LOD zero of 10,000 and 5,000

139
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.399
vertices. Now in virtual production, this could be relevant because you might want to isolate the

140
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.559
hero asset to an LOD of zero, then perhaps the rest of the assets or assets that are further away

141
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:31.439
from the camera to an LOD of four, for example, then if we wanted to, we can just activate this

142
00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:38.559
custom checkbox and we would be able to deactivate specific LODs on this asset. So if we wanted to

143
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:45.439
keep it to a high resolution range, then we could disable LOD four, three and two. Now, even if we

144
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.360
zoomed back from the object, the resolution will still stay on a high level versus if we did the

145
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.520
opposite, if we just kept the LOD three, four and two, then we would just be using those three types

146
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:05.120
of LODs. Now turning them all on again, if I scroll down here, you can see that I will get access

147
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.560
to the specific details and settings to all the different LODs, the LOD zero, one, two, three and

148
00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:18.319
four. And then if I open up the reduction settings menu, you can see that you have it on all the

149
00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:24.000
different LODs, you can actually choose the percent of triangles you want to have on the static mesh

150
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.679
on this specific LOD. So for example, for the LOD four, you would have the six percent of the total

151
00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:36.159
vertices and then on the LOD zero, you would have a hundred percent triangles. When trying to optimize

152
00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:41.119
the scene for virtual production, sometimes even the LOD four settings might still be too detailed

153
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.080
and in that case, it's really useful to use this reduction settings option to reduce the geometry

154
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.360
of the mesh at this specific LOD. This is useful to optimize your map, especially if you find yourself

155
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.480
unable to hit that 30 or 60 FPS mark on the LOD screens. Now if I scroll down even more, you can

156
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.320
see that you can assign a different LOD group based on the type of prop or asset that this is.

157
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.639
And then down here, you can see that you can choose the number of LODs you want to use,

158
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:15.919
as well as choosing whether you want to automatically compute the LOD distances or not. So if you turn

159
00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:21.199
this off, you will get access to the screen size option here to the different LODs and

160
00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:26.559
define the screen size that the object needs to have in the viewport when swapping to the different

161
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:32.319
LODs. All right, I hope this provided you with a good overview on the different LOD settings that

162
00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:37.919
we have at our disposal in the static mesh editor. And now we're going to switch back to our slides

163
00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:43.439
to conclude this video. All right, that was it for this class. Shout out to Sean Spitzer for

164
00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:48.479
the creation of these slides. And I want to also thank Brandon Jones and King Chen for allowing us

165
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:53.199
to display their concept art in the beginning slides of this presentation. You can find some

166
00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:58.240
additional documentation at this link if you're interested in learning more about FEB and the

167
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.360
Quixel Bridge plugin for Unreal Engine. Thanks for sticking around and in the next course, we'll be

168
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.279
learning some basic lighting concepts and how they work together with Nanite. Will I see you there?

169
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.039
All right, bye.
