00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.000
Our goal for this class is to learn to use the foliage tool to populate our worlds in

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.519
a short amount of time.

4
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.679
So let's get started.

5
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:18.000
The foliage mode is a tool that allows you to quickly add lots of objects like trees,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.199
bushes, rocks, or even cubes if you wanted to, to your scene by simply painting them

7
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.199
in.

8
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.839
Instead of placing hundreds and hundreds of single objects one by one, you can just paint

9
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.000
them in.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.679
The foliage tool is incredibly optimized for rendering large number of objects.

11
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.620
It uses instance rendering, meaning that our GPU will draw a lot of copies of the same

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.960
mesh in a single draw call rather than processing each one of them individually.

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.159
Unreal environment artists commonly use the foliage tool to fill large areas with natural

14
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.559
details like vegetation or small rocks.

15
00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.519
However, for hero assets that we will see up close, it's better to place those manually

16
00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.439
for precise control.

17
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.359
The foliage mode is absolutely perfect for background decoration, but placing assets

18
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.959
by hand is still best if you have specific compositions in mind.

19
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.000
So let's jump into the engine and see this tool in action.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.799
So first of all, let's create a quick landscape we can paint the foliage on.

21
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.239
I'm going to switch from selection mode to landscape.

22
00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:31.159
Then down here, I just want to set the scale to 100, the section size to seven by seven

23
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.640
quads, so the smaller and the rest of it is all right as it is.

24
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.920
And then we can click on create.

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
Okay, now from landscape mode up here, let's switch to foliage mode.

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.319
Up here on our toolbar, we will find a few tools which will allow us to differently interact

27
00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.159
with our painted foliage.

28
00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.560
But by default, we're painting.

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.359
Well actually right now we wouldn't be able to paint anything because we have not specified

30
00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.000
which assets we'd like to paint with.

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.040
But if we click on this button plus foliage, we can see that we have a few assets already

32
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.480
prepared at our disposal.

33
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.599
So we can click all three of them.

34
00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.000
One, two, and three.

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
And their checkboxes will be ticked automatically.

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.599
This means that right now we would be painting with all the three assets.

37
00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:22.079
But we could also just toggle one of them off if we wanted to just isolate the painting

38
00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.799
with those two.

39
00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.479
So if we hover over on landscape now, you will see this purple selection bulb.

40
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:36.479
And if we click anywhere, we will be able to paint our foliage, which is incredibly satisfying.

41
00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.439
Now if we're not happy with whatever we painted, we can press shift on our keyboard and we would

42
00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.439
be switching directly into the erase tool.

43
00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.199
And then we can click anywhere we want to erase our foliage.

44
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.400
Now if we wanted to, we could also select each individual foliage asset we have painted

45
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.479
and then move it around.

46
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:02.120
We could also select all of them or deselect all of them.

47
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.159
We have a few other tools here at our disposal, but we won't get into them right now.

48
00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:13.639
Now if we select any of our foliage assets, a few settings down here will be displayed.

49
00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:19.519
You would be able to change the mesh that we want to be painting with this foliage asset,

50
00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.679
the density, so how much of it we want to paint with a single brush stroke, the radius,

51
00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.679
the scale and more.

52
00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:32.399
And if you wanted to, you could also select multiple assets at once and then apply those

53
00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.439
changes to all of them.

54
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.439
There is something I want to change down here and that's the mobility of our foliage.

55
00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.319
Right now it's set to static, but we actually want to switch it to movable.

56
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.799
This way we'll make sure our foliage receives accurate indirect lighting and contributes

57
00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.000
to the scene global illumination.

58
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.120
If we left the foliage too static with Lumen enabled, we could see some artifacts, so make

59
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.120
sure you switch the mobility to movable.

60
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.959
Now for foliage or translucent objects, Lumen can still struggle a little bit, especially

61
00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.400
when they're placed in front of other translucent or objects that are highly emissive.

62
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.760
So make sure not to overlap them too much with other translucent objects, like the clouds

63
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.560
for example, because you might see some artifacts.

64
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.879
So unfortunately we won't dive any deeper than this into the foliage today, but you

65
00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.120
can find some designated classes explaining how to use it on our educational platform.

66
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.439
So I'd encourage you to check them out if you're interested in learning more about it.

67
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.639
Now one last thing I wanted to mention is that if you're working in a pretty heavy environment,

68
00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.560
you can also convert the specific foliage assets to Nanite.

69
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.560
So if we scroll up here, then select one asset, we can find the mesh that is assigned to it,

70
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.039
and then navigate to it in the content browser.

71
00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.120
Now down here, if you right click on this specific asset, we can find up here Nanite,

72
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.399
and right now it's already enabled.

73
00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.279
But this is something that you can check out if your performance start being impacted

74
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.719
with the amount of foliage you have added to your scene.

75
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.680
So I hope this little demo gave you an overall idea of how to work in foliage mode.

76
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.800
Let's switch back to the slides now to conclude this video.

77
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.120
Alright, that was it for this class, and at this link you can find other extensive documentation

78
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.600
and resources to learn more tips on adding foliage to your environment.

79
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.640
In the next lesson, we will take a look at profiling in Unreal Engine.

80
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.360
Have fun building your environments, and I'll see you soon.

81
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.960
Bye!
