00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Welcome back and thank you for your interest in learning more about

2
00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.440
world building for virtual production.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.679
In this class, we'll review our agenda for the upcoming lessons,

4
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.839
and then we'll take a look into derived data cache and its importance.

5
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.320
As I just anticipated,

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.600
in this first module we'll explore derived data cache.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.359
We'll be starting out with some ground theory on it,

8
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.359
understanding what DTC is,

9
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.760
its different types,

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.560
and where it's located and how to change that.

11
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.240
Once the theory is covered and out of the way,

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.079
we'll be ready to dive into world scopes and initial setup.

13
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.039
We'll be exploring different ways of dealing with a project,

14
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.439
breaking it down into shocks and assets,

15
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:46.679
and importing outside assets from libraries like Megascans or Fab.

16
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.119
And after that, we'll be uncovering some basic lighting concepts

17
00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.599
and briefly talk about a very useful tool called Environment Light Mixer,

18
00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:58.960
which is used to quickly set up our maps with realistic lighting.

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.439
Alright, spicing it up a bit,

20
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.920
we'll explore different approaches of editing assets,

21
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.640
whether using construction blueprints or blueprints in general,

22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.319
procedural content generators, or modeling tools.

23
00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:15.240
We'll also discuss about how to manage levels using the Stage Monitor

24
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.599
and increment them easily using the Level Snapshot tool.

25
00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.640
Then we'll get an overview on materials

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.359
and how to use them efficiently using material instancing.

27
00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.920
Lastly, we'll conclude this course by learning about the foliage tool

28
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.560
and we'll be getting a little nerdy checking out the profiling tool of the engine.

29
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.480
Cool, let's get started with some draft data cache theory.

30
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.840
First of all, in basic computer terms,

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
a cache is a small, fast storage area of your computer memory

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.439
where your computer temporarily keeps copies of frequently used information

33
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.680
so it can access that information much more quickly

34
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
than going back to the original source each time.

35
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.080
This is similar to keeping your most used items on your desk

36
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.360
rather than just storing them in a cabinet across the room.

37
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.280
In Unreal Engine terms, the draft data cache holds a very similar function.

38
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.800
DDC is like a smart finding system that saves your time when working with assets.

39
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.680
Imagine you have assets like textures or models

40
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.680
that need to be processed before the engine can use them.

41
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.719
Instead of processing these assets from scratch every time you need them,

42
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.599
Unreal stores the processed versions into DCC's.

43
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.520
When Unreal needs a processed asset,

44
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.599
it first checks the fastest, closest storage location.

45
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.639
If not found there, it checks progressively slower storage locations.

46
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.439
And when found, it copies that data to the fastest storage for quicker access next time.

47
00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.120
If not found anywhere, Unreal processes it from scratch,

48
00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:55.520
then saves it to all storage locations so it's available to you or your team in the future.

49
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.640
Now the DCC contains only 10 Ferrari copies

50
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960
that Unreal Engine can just throw away and recreate whenever it needs them.

51
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.879
The original files are the U-Asset ones

52
00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.759
and those contain all the important information.

53
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.719
So make sure not to delete them or just move them around.

54
00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.759
Now this setup is really helpful because Unreal Engine can change

55
00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:20.319
how it works with our assets without ever changing their original files.

56
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.840
Kind of like making different versions of a photo

57
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.759
without changing the original image itself.

58
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.799
There are two main types of DCC's.

59
00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.359
The boot DCC, which consists of startup files

60
00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.479
loaded into memory to increase boot times.

61
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:41.680
And then the local DCC, which includes the derived data for our projects.

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.719
If you're interested in learning about the different DCC types in depth,

63
00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.560
I'd encourage you to follow the link in the slide down here

64
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.080
because it will provide you with all the information and specifics you need.

65
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.599
Let's jump into the engine for a moment to take a glimpse at the Zen server

66
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.719
and other cache statistics.

67
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.520
Alright, so if we take a look down here,

68
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.280
we can find the green check mark with Zen server written right next to it.

69
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.319
And the Zen server or the Unreal Zen storage is an EpicMate program

70
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.759
that manages our local DCC's separately from the main editor.

71
00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.639
Now by default, when we launch the editor,

72
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.279
the Zen server automatically starts too.

73
00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:26.240
And when we close the editor down, then the Zen server does the same.

74
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.039
And that's why we have this green check mark here.

75
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.519
All it says is that the Zen server is on.

76
00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:36.360
Now if we click on Zen server, we get access to a few options.

77
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.399
The first one being the launch dashboard.

78
00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:46.199
And if we launch it, we'll get an overview of how our Zen server is doing.

79
00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.439
We can see that it is running on the engine version 5.6

80
00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.479
and that the disk space that this project is occupying is 4.2 gigs.

81
00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.599
Now under tools here, we have the option of stopping, restarting

82
00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.519
or starting the Zen server if we wanted to.

83
00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.560
And then we have something really useful down here.

84
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.680
We could actually launch a garbage collection process

85
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.639
and then free some unused disk space.

86
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.120
So this process will basically just delete some unused asset

87
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.199
and we can choose whether we want to just delete all the unused asset

88
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.399
or the asset we haven't used in a week

89
00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.680
or the ones we haven't used in the past day.

90
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.560
And then our project will get lighter.

91
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.240
Okay, let's check out some few different options that we have down here.

92
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.000
So if I click on cash settings, we will go into the editor preferences.

93
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.280
We'll be able to change the global local DDC and shared DDC paths if we wanted to.

94
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.319
Or the individual project local and shared DDCs.

95
00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:56.199
We will be able to enable all disabled notifications for the derived data cache

96
00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.040
as well as enable or disable the AWS S3 cache.

97
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.439
And then we will be able to input the Horde server URL.

98
00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.319
We would be using the Horde server if we needed help distributing build tasks.

99
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:17.600
So if we were building a game or a project across multiple computers in a theme environment.

100
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.439
Okay, what else do we have down here?

101
00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:24.879
We have the cache statistics, which would tell us what's been loaded here in the project

102
00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.320
and how it's working.

103
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.680
And then we also have the cache resource usage,

104
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.280
which would tell us how our resources are being used.

105
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.519
All right, let's go back to our slides and see how to set up shared DDCs.

106
00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:47.519
So a shared draft data cache in Unreal Engine is a system where processed asset data

107
00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:53.280
is stored in a central location that all team members can access, like a shared drive.

108
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.720
Instead of each person having to process the same asset individually,

109
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.320
which can take a long time, the first person processes it

110
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.920
and everyone else can use that same processed version.

111
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.080
By default, the editor is not set up to use a shared DDC

112
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.200
and instead each person's Unreal installation uses a local DDC stored in the wrong computer.

113
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.640
But we can easily enable shared DDC either by adding an override in the default engine

114
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.760
configuration file to set the path of the project to a shared location.

115
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.719
By setting an environment variable to the shared folder

116
00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:31.759
or setting the shared draft data cache variable in the editor.

117
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.000
Now, in order to work together with a team on a single or multiple projects,

118
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.159
those projects would first need to be accessible by every member of the team

119
00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.560
on their own individual computers.

120
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.120
Now, there are various ways of setting that up.

121
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.000
The simplest would probably be mapping a network drive on your local network.

122
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.160
This will allow you to share this mapped network or folder across your team

123
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.279
as long as they're connected to the same network as yours.

124
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:04.639
You can find further information at this link to understand how to do that in a Windows environment.

125
00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.079
And a simple research online will let you find different solutions

126
00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:13.199
for different operating systems too, like Linux or Mac OS.

127
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.560
All right, that was it for this class.

128
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.920
But you can find some additional documentation at this link

129
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.720
if you're interested in further expanding your knowledge in the RAP data cache

130
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.680
and mapped network drives.

131
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.879
Thanks for sticking around.

132
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:29.240
And in the upcoming lesson, we will look into world scopes and initial setups

133
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.080
when building our environments for virtual production.
