00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.320
In this class, we'll be exploring

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.100
Blueprint and Modeling Tools

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.400
for managing assets in Unreal.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.439
Let's get right into it.

6
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.320
In Unreal, a Blueprint class

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.839
defines the type of actor that you can place into your scene as instances.

8
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.140
Editing that Blueprint class will update

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.920
every instance of it in our project, and that's really handy.

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.000
There are various types of Blueprints you can create.

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.920
Based on their parent classes,

12
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.679
they will inherit different kinds of properties.

13
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.640
Today, we're going to be using the Actor class type,

14
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.400
which is an object that can be easily placed in the world.

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.359
A Blueprint Actor specifically can hold various components in it,

16
00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.079
like static mesh components, collision components,

17
00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.400
audio components, and more.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.960
These components define the actor's appearance,

19
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.880
behavior, and how it interacts with the world.

20
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.760
This all comes quite useful to us,

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.120
because a Blueprint Actor will basically be a basket

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.439
to which we will add all the eggs we'd like.

23
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.079
With the click of a button,

24
00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.680
we could easily swap the eggs with cubes,

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.599
as well as change their appearance if we wanted to.

26
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.480
Thus, changes would be applied not only to the Blueprint Actor,

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.079
but also to all the instances of it in our Maps.

28
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.000
I know this whole Blueprint-Majorowska concept

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359
can feel quite abstract at the beginning.

30
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.480
Let's jump into the Engine and see it in action.

31
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.480
I want to keep things simple for this video,

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.760
so I'm just going to go under File, New Level,

33
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.959
and then Create a Basic Level.

34
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.400
Down here, we can just click on the Player Start and delete it,

35
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.799
because we're not going to be using it today.

36
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.200
Then up here in the Quick Ad menu,

37
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.480
we can go under Shapes and create a Simple Cube.

38
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.000
If we wanted to add this Simple Cube to a Blueprint,

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120
we could just click on this Blueprint button up here,

40
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.240
and then convert the selection to a Blueprint class.

41
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.240
You can choose different creation methods.

42
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.319
The one that I find the most modular

43
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.319
is the Harvest Component one.

44
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.159
We can choose the parent class to be whatever we want.

45
00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.480
We can also choose it to be an Actor,

46
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.599
but for now, I'm going to keep it to Static Mesh Actor.

47
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.079
The parent class of this Blueprint will be Static Mesh Actor.

48
00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.000
The Blueprint name, I'm going to assign it to BP underscore cube,

49
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.400
and then I'm going to just save it under the Blueprints folder up here.

50
00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.879
All right, so this will open my default BP cube,

51
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.560
and I'm just going to dock it up here.

52
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.000
So you can see up here that we have two different components

53
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.079
assigned to our Blueprint,

54
00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.959
and the third one is the Static Mesh Component

55
00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.719
with our cube assigned to it.

56
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.319
Up here, you can find the parent class of this Blueprint,

57
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.400
which is the Static Mesh Actor.

58
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.599
Now, if we wanted to, we could just move this cube around.

59
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.199
We could change this to a different mesh,

60
00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.519
and we could also change the material assigned to it.

61
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.000
But first, I want to show you how to do things a little bit differently,

62
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.840
because if we go back to our map,

63
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.120
we can see that since the parent class of this BP cube

64
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.560
is a Static Mesh Actor,

65
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.840
its thumbnail up here is the one of a Static Mesh,

66
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840
which can be a little bit confusing,

67
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.960
because it's not a Static Mesh, it's actually a Blueprint.

68
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.479
And if you simply click on it,

69
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.039
it looks as if there is no Static Mesh assigned to it,

70
00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.159
and that's simply because we selected the parent of the class,

71
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.599
not the single component.

72
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.240
So if we click on Static Mesh Component 1,

73
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.240
we'll get access to the single component,

74
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.719
and we would be able to change it if we wanted to.

75
00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.039
Since this method can be a little bit confusing,

76
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.039
I'm going to show you a different one.

77
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.439
So let's right-click in the Content Browser,

78
00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.280
and then create a Blueprint class.

79
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.879
We can choose Actor as Parent Class,

80
00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.640
and then we're going to call this BP cube Actor.

81
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.680
Now, you can already see from the thumbnail up here

82
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.840
that those two Blueprints have two different Parent Classes.

83
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.719
The one of the Actor usually has this little sphere

84
00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.560
with a plane underneath it.

85
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.360
So let's double-click on it to open it up,

86
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.920
and you can see that it's completely empty.

87
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.800
That's because we haven't added any components to it.

88
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.000
So if we go here on the left, we can click on Add,

89
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.680
and then Static Mesh.

90
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.759
And if we click on our Static Mesh,

91
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.120
we can go into the Details,

92
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.600
and then choose any Static Mesh Actor we want to down here,

93
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.280
and I'm just going to choose the cube.

94
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.240
All right.

95
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000
Now that I've made my changes to the Blueprint,

96
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.759
I want to make sure to Compile.

97
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.600
You need to always compile your Blueprints,

98
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.800
and then I'm just going to Save.

99
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.960
Now, if I go back to my map,

100
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.680
and then I drag and drop this BPQ Actor

101
00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.680
into the Scene, it will be spawned in my map.

102
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.920
Now, let's say we wanted to apply more changes

103
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.759
to this Blueprint container.

104
00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.680
So I'm just going to go right into it,

105
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120
and then I'm going to be adding a new Static Mesh.

106
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.360
And if you, like me, had the cube Static Mesh Component

107
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.199
selected and then clicked on Add,

108
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.199
and then added a new Static Mesh,

109
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.439
you might have added a child of this Static Mesh Component.

110
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.480
I'll show you what I mean.

111
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.399
So if I click on Static Mesh 1,

112
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.799
which is the second Static Mesh we created,

113
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.679
and then add a different Static Mesh to it, like a cone,

114
00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.000
you will see that we can move this cone independently.

115
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.639
But then if I click on the first Static Mesh,

116
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.159
which is supposed to be the parent,

117
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.919
and then I move it around, the cube will go with it.

118
00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.959
That's because the cone is attached to it.

119
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.159
But if I just drag and drop it on top of it,

120
00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.159
it will be side by side.

121
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.879
So I could move the cube independently of the cone.

122
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.879
Okay, let's compile and save these changes,

123
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.000
and then go back to our map,

124
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.759
and you can see that the changes were immediately applied to our map.

125
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.159
And if I alt and drag onto the gizmo,

126
00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.319
I could duplicate this Blueprint instance,

127
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.399
and I could do it as many times if I want.

128
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.759
Now, if I go back to my Blueprint cube actor,

129
00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.000
I could assign a different material to this,

130
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.639
like a basic yellow material to the cone,

131
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.479
and then a basic red material to the cube.

132
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.319
I would compile and save,

133
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.599
and if I go back to my map,

134
00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.159
you can see that the changes were applied to all of them.

135
00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.319
Now, the ones you see here are instances of the Blueprint actor.

136
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.199
So the Blueprint actor, we can say it's the father

137
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.599
of all these different children.

138
00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.599
If I wanted to, I could apply individual changes to each one of them.

139
00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.680
If I double click on a Blueprint actor,

140
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.240
I get access to their individual components.

141
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.160
So this means that I could just move this cube around and the cone,

142
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.680
and I could even just change the whole static mesh assigned to it

143
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.040
if I wanted to, as well as the material.

144
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.720
But these changes would just be applied to this individual instance,

145
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.240
and they won't actually appear in my Blueprint actor,

146
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.720
that's because the Blueprint actor is the father,

147
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.160
and those are the children.

148
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.079
Let's jump back into the slides to take a look at modeling tools

149
00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.040
and how to use them.

150
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.160
Now, modeling tools lets us create, sculpt,

151
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.680
and edit 3D geometry directly in Unreal Engine.

152
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.600
But before diving into them any further,

153
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.840
we need to make sure that the modeling tools editor mode plugin

154
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.680
is enabled in our project.

155
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.759
The other two that you see here in the slide

156
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.080
don't really matter for what we're going to be doing today,

157
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.040
so the modeling tools editor mode would suffice.

158
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.280
Make sure to restart the engine after you enable the plugin.

159
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.680
So today, we're going to keep it quite simple

160
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.319
and we're just going to learn how to adjust pivot points

161
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.439
on our static mesh actors using the modeling tools.

162
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.800
So let's jump into the engine and learn how to do that.

163
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.600
Okay, first of all, I'm just going to go file, new level,

164
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.040
and create another basic map just to keep it simple.

165
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.040
And we don't need to save these changes.

166
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.920
Then I'm just going to be deleting my player start.

167
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.240
And in this map, we just want to add a mega scan asset,

168
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.280
any asset would do.

169
00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:04.000
So I'm just going to choose a dead tree.

170
00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.199
And then I'm going to be importing it into my map.

171
00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:11.119
Now, if our aim for today were to be changing the pivot

172
00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:14.559
of this mesh temporarily, we could simply do it

173
00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:17.759
by pressing alt on our keyboard and then middle mouse button

174
00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:21.039
on our mesh or anywhere else where we wanted our pivot

175
00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:22.079
to be positioned.

176
00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:24.719
So I'm just going to be setting it there.

177
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:29.759
And then if I were to perform a transform action,

178
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.639
so just rotate scale or move this object,

179
00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.879
it would be performed from this pivot point.

180
00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:37.120
Now, since that's at temporary position,

181
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.519
the pivot point would immediately snap back

182
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.960
to its original position.

183
00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.679
And now I'm just going to reset the location

184
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.080
and rotation to its original values.

185
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.919
And if you wanted that temporary pivot to actually stick

186
00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.919
and be permanently replaced, then you would need to again,

187
00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:56.559
press alt on the keyboard and middle mouse button

188
00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.080
to whatever you want it to be positioned.

189
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.840
And then right click on the mesh, pivot and set as pivot offset.

190
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.600
Now, even if we perform any changes to the position

191
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.040
of this mesh or rotated it around, as well as clicking away

192
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.000
and then back on the tree, the pivot would stay as it was.

193
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.120
And if you wanted to reset it, you could just right click

194
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.560
on the tree, pivot and reset pivot offset.

195
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.879
And now we'll go back to its original position.

196
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.240
Now, this method of changing the pivot position

197
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.120
is not very precise and it's a little bit finicky,

198
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.320
as you could see.

199
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.159
So let's take a look at how to achieve this

200
00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.000
using the modeling tools instead.

201
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.840
Now, you got to be careful.

202
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.560
And before you apply any changes to a static mesh actor

203
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.799
in your map using the modeling tools,

204
00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:42.879
you want to make sure to duplicate it first

205
00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.000
in the content browser.

206
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.639
This might sound a little unintuitive

207
00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.320
based on the behavior we just saw

208
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.919
using the blueprint actors

209
00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:52.639
because modeling tools actually work the opposite.

210
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:56.399
Basically, any changes you apply to a static mesh actor

211
00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.360
using the modeling tools in your map

212
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.439
is also going to be applied to the static mesh asset itself,

213
00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.759
the one we have here in the content browser.

214
00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:08.879
So these changes won't just stick to our map only,

215
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.559
but to our entire project.

216
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.519
Meaning that if we use this static tree mesh

217
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:16.000
into a different scene within our project

218
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.439
and we edited it here into this map using the modeling tools,

219
00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:22.000
those changes will be applied to the three

220
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.679
in the other scenes too.

221
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.279
So that's why it's extremely important

222
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.279
to duplicate the asset you'd like to change

223
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.360
in the content browser first.

224
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.320
So let's do that.

225
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.559
I'm going to right click on the SMDat tree

226
00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:34.879
and then duplicate it.

227
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.279
Now I'm just going to call it that tree changed.

228
00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.200
And then with the dat tree,

229
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.159
a static mesh actor selected into my map,

230
00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.240
I'm just going to go into the details panel

231
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.720
and then click on this little button down here

232
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.240
to use the selected asset

233
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.759
that we have in the content browser.

234
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.240
As assigned mesh to this actor.

235
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.559
Now nothing will change in your map

236
00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:59.360
because this is simply a duplicate of the original tree.

237
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.200
But this will make sure that any changes

238
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.360
that we apply on this dat tree

239
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.399
will just be applied to this changed pivot asset

240
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.720
and not to the original one that we also used

241
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.519
in the other map.

242
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:13.039
Now let's switch our mode from selection mode

243
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.320
to modeling mode.

244
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.799
And then under the XForm section,

245
00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:19.519
you can see the edit pivot tool.

246
00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:22.960
And here you want to make sure that you apply the changes

247
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.319
to all the LODs.

248
00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:25.679
This is really important.

249
00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:28.480
And you can also snap drag the position of the pivot

250
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.559
or snap drag the rotation of the pivot

251
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.759
if you needed to.

252
00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:34.159
And then this box position will basically

253
00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.720
be based on the bounding box of the tree.

254
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.480
And I could choose to position the pivot

255
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.879
at the center of the bounding box at the bottom,

256
00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:43.439
the top, the left, the right, the back, the front,

257
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.120
and the world origin.

258
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.079
I'm going to stick to center for now.

259
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.560
And then apply my changes.

260
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.440
OK, so this will be a permanent change,

261
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.400
meaning that if I drag out of this tree

262
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.160
to create a different instance of it,

263
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.080
the pivot position will stay the same

264
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.879
as well as if I drag another instance of it

265
00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:05.440
from the content browser directly into my map,

266
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.240
the pivot point would be the one that we just changed.

267
00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:11.759
If we import the 01, meaning the original tree,

268
00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.520
you will see that the pivot point would be

269
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.040
in a different position.

270
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040
So there are a lot of other tools here

271
00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:20.079
you can use to deform or edit your mesh

272
00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:21.519
with the modeling tools,

273
00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.759
but that's going to be it for today's class.

274
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.480
But you're nice, so I'll give you a quick tip nonetheless.

275
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.039
If you're going to apply drastic modeling changes

276
00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:35.759
to any asset, make sure to go under Edit Project Settings.

277
00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.559
And then in the search bar, type Enable,

278
00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:43.519
Raytracing, while editing, and you want to turn this on.

279
00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.759
This will prevent weird artifacts to appear

280
00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:48.240
in your viewport while you're editing your assets.

281
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:52.799
Then also, if you aim to deform the shape of your mesh,

282
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:55.200
it might be good to check out once you're done

283
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.559
that your UVs are still correctly tiling on your object

284
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:00.480
and reproject them if necessary.

285
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.200
You can find the UV Editor under More and UVs up here.

286
00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:07.840
But luckily for today,

287
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.799
we just wanted to change the pivot position of our mesh,

288
00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:13.439
so no drastic changes on your resin for now.

289
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.120
I hope this gave you a good glimpse at modeling tools

290
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.800
and how to use them in your project.

291
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.920
Let's go back to our slides to conclude this video.

292
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.520
So that was it for this class,

293
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.200
but you can find some additional documentation at this link

294
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.920
if you're interested in further extending your knowledge

295
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.160
in blueprint assets and modeling tools.

296
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.320
I'd also encourage you, as usual, to take a look at our courses

297
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.800
focused on in-editor modeling tools

298
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.200
to learn more about the specific set of tools

299
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.000
in the engine.

300
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.040
Thanks for sticking around, and in the upcoming lesson,

301
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.200
we will look into level editing,

302
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.640
as well as the stage monitor and level snapshots.

303
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.120
I'll see you there. Bye.
