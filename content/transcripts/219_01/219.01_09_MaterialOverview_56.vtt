00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
Hi, welcome back and thank you for your interest in learning more about world building for

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.500
virtual production.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.960
In this lesson, we'll be quickly getting an overview of parent and instance materials.

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.620
So let's get right into it.

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.940
To display it, you can find a few steps you can follow for the development of a very basic

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.940
material setup.

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.379
But let's dive directly into the engine and review a parent material together with its

8
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.980
material instance.

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.859
All right, so we're in our original map.

10
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.780
But to keep things simple, I'm just gonna go under file and new level and create a very

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.780
basic level.

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.500
All right, down here, we're not gonna use the player start.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.980
So I'm just gonna click on it and delete it.

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.460
And then I want to add from the quick add menu, a very simple cube.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.099
So I'll navigate to shapes and cube.

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.420
All right, then I want to zero out the location down here in the details panel.

17
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.740
And I want to swap out this cube with a preview mesh, preview material zero one mesh, which

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.420
is typically used to preview materials.

19
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.780
All right, now we want to assign a different material to this preview mesh.

20
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.599
And I already have something in mind.

21
00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:24.620
So I'm gonna make sure to have the highest folder in our project here key selected.

22
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.420
And then I'm gonna search for MI for material instance on the score floor.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.300
Now a material instance is a child of a parent material that lets you change specific parameters

24
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.900
without creating an entirely new material.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.540
And we'll open it up in just a second.

26
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.420
So you understand what I mean, using material instances saves performance because our engine

27
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.620
just needs to compile the parent materials shader once and all its instances can share

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.980
that compiled the shader code and just swap out the parameters values in real time.

29
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.580
So let's assign this specific material to our preview mesh by clicking it in the content

30
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.420
browser and then drag and dropping it on top of the preview mesh.

31
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.659
Now if we navigate again into a details panel down here into the element zero, you will

32
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.099
find the MI floor assigned.

33
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.819
So if we double click on the thumbnail, we'll be able to open this material instance up.

34
00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.780
You can see that we have a few parameters here that we can play around with.

35
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.620
And if we click on them, it will be activated.

36
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.659
These parameters are values that we have consciously exposed in the parent material to have them

37
00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.459
accessible in each instance of it.

38
00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.180
So if we wanted to up here, we could for example, change the color.

39
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.900
And if I undo this material instance and then start changing the color right here, you can

40
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.979
see that these changes are happening in real time.

41
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:50.379
OK, now let's scroll a little bit down here and we can find the parent material connected

42
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.939
to this instance.

43
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.780
So if we double click again on this thumbnail, we will be able to open up the parent material.

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.379
So let's just talk both of them back into our workspace and navigate to M underscore

45
00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.620
backing, which is the parent material.

46
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.500
OK, if we zoom into the material graph, you can see that we have the base color, the metallic

47
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.780
and the roughness exposed as parameters.

48
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.539
Let's try to add a texture to our preview mesh.

49
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:21.819
So if I right click in an empty area of the graph and then search for texture, you will

50
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.979
see up here already selected the texture sample.

51
00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.420
So let's click on it to create a texture sample node.

52
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.460
And then we want to be able to expose it to our material instance.

53
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.740
So I'm just going to right click on it and then convert to parameter.

54
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.020
We can call this parameter main texture, and I'm going to connect the RGB to the base

55
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.860
color of our material.

56
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.379
Now, Unreal is going to complain because we haven't assigned any texture to our texture

57
00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.140
sample. So if we select the node and then scroll down here, we can find a main texture

58
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.020
slot and I'm just going to add to it the icon green.

59
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.500
Now let's save these changes and apply.

60
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.180
Now if we go back to our material instance and then open up the global texture parameter

61
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.860
values, you will find our main texture parameter here exposed.

62
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.060
If we enable it, we will be able to change it on the fly.

63
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.420
So if we end up this window again, and we navigate to our level, you will be able to

64
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.620
find this main texture, apply to our preview mesh.

65
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.459
And if we change it to something else, like the analog hat, then it will change to this

66
00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.259
bullseye directly.

67
00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.420
So I know this little demo was short, but I hope it helped giving you an overall idea

68
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.819
of what materials are and how to use them.

69
00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.980
Let's switch back to the slides and take a look at how we can best use the material instances

70
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.420
to our advantage in a project.

71
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.139
All right, so we mentioned already that material instances are really useful to save memory

72
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.099
overhead and performance.

73
00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.300
But keep in mind that if all the texturing and shading of a whole environment were to

74
00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.220
originate from one single master material, and then there were like 1000 material instances

75
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.259
assigned to each element of this environment, then your GPU performance will still be quite

76
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.259
impacted.

77
00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.180
For this reason, it's a good practice to create different parent materials for different

78
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.620
kinds of surfaces like rocks, trees, water, and so on.

79
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.220
And then create instances of those different categories of surfaces directly.

80
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.820
This way, you'll still be using material instances in your project that will keep your VRAM in

81
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.820
place.

82
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.020
All right, that was it for this class.

83
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.820
I hope you had a good time.

84
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.940
Thank you to Sean Spitzer for the creation of this course.

85
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.060
You can find some additional documentation at this link if you're interested in further

86
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.980
expanding your knowledge in physically based materials or materials overall.

87
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.140
I'd also encourage you to take a look at our courses focused on materials on our platform,

88
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.939
because they will dive into this concept in better details.

89
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.699
Thank you for sticking around, and in the upcoming lesson, we will look into the foliage

90
00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.699
tool.

91
00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:01.699
I'll see you there.

92
00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:02.199
Bye.
