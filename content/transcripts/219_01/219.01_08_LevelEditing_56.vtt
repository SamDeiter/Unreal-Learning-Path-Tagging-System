00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello again. I really appreciate you sticking with me through this course and hope you're

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.000
learning a lot from it. In this lesson, we'll be exploring level management as well as

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
checking a peek at the Stage Monitor and Level Snapshots tool we have at hand.

4
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.120
Alright, first and foremost, what is a level? We've been interacting with some since the

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.879
beginning of this course but we never actually sat down and accurately defined them. A level

6
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:36.960
also commonly referred to as a map is a self-contained 3D environment or scene that serves as the

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.640
stage for our content. Now, the concept of level management in this case is a hot topic

8
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.399
for linear and legacy production, but not really for game development. In games, you

9
00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.159
would rather use something called world partition instead, which lets you basically slice a

10
00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.919
large map into smaller ones and use level streaming to load or unload them as the player

11
00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:07.759
moves across the scene. Depending on the complexity of your environment, you could handle using

12
00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.199
a single level only, especially if you're flying solo, but as soon as you start working

13
00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:18.959
with a team on a real-time production, level management becomes an essential part of your

14
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:24.640
pipeline. That's because it allows different artists to collaborate on a scene at the same

15
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.000
time and that's without interfering with each other. You basically chop the elements

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.280
composing your environment into different tasks assigned to different artists and each

17
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.000
one of these tasks, like lighting, props, vegetation, could be allocated to a separate

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.159
map and all of these maps together would generate the final scene.

19
00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.200
Level management could also improve your viewport performance, especially when working on a

20
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.799
cinematic or animation production, because camera or animation artists could isolate

21
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.760
the areas of an environment where the animation could be taking place and save resources to

22
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.840
increase the frame rate on their viewport to play the work in progress animations in

23
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.439
real time. So, level management is really important and learning how to work with it

24
00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.879
will make you a true real-time team player. Alright, the main tool behind level management

25
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.479
lies in the Levels tab. And there are a few ways of adding a level to your Levels tab,

26
00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:31.199
so let's review them directly in the engine. Alright, we want to navigate to Window and

27
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:36.960
then down here you can find Levels. That's not to be confused with the Layers panel,

28
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.599
even though the naming is quite similar and they're next to each other, so I get that

29
00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.800
it can be a little bit confusing. But compared to the Levels tab, the Layers panel gives

30
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.560
you the ability to control the visibility of groups of actors in your scene, so it doesn't

31
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.160
handle the visibility of your maps entirely, but simply the visibility of the assets that

32
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.840
are already in that map. But today we want to take care of the maps individually, so let's

33
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.960
click on Levels instead. So you will see up here that there is the Persistent Level. The Persistent

34
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.800
Level is the father of all the sub-levels or the levels that are within it. The Persistent

35
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.159
Level in this case is the Assembly Small Level. Now the Text in bold means that this specific

36
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:30.360
level is active. The Active Level is the one where the changes will be applied to if any

37
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.920
changes are applied to the scene. And if you double click on any of the levels within the

38
00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:41.000
Levels tab, you will make that level active. This asterisk icon right next to the text means

39
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.439
that there are unapplied changes to the map. So if, for example, we make the Geo Level active,

40
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.919
and then we add a cube in it, you will see that the change would be applied to the Geo Level,

41
00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.639
and here there would be an asterisk because there are unsaved changes. So if you Control

42
00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.319
Shift-Test, we would apply your changes to all maps and save all. And then if we toggle the visibility

43
00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.039
on and off of the Geo Level, you will see that the cube would be in it. Now there is this NDC

44
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:15.959
level out here, which is basically just a tool to send red letters to the LED volumes. Okay,

45
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.039
let's delete this cube and Control Shift-Test again. Now if you wanted to, you could add an

46
00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.719
existing level to your Levels tab. You can do that either by selecting the level you want to add

47
00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:32.839
in the Content Browser and then drag and dropping it into the Levels tab. Or I'm just going to

48
00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:39.799
delete this. We can just click on these Levels down arrow and then add existing. And you can

49
00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:44.599
select that you want to add as sub-level to our Persistent one. Now if the level you're trying to

50
00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.879
create doesn't exist yet and should contain assets that are currently present in your scene, then you

51
00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:56.359
can easily select them in the Viewport and then go to Levels, create new with selected actors,

52
00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.479
choose a name and then save. I'm not going to do it right now because I don't want to mess around

53
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.759
with my levels. Also, if you wanted to, you have the option to merge multiple levels. So you can

54
00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.920
just select them in the Levels tab and then go under Levels and Merge. And this will create a new

55
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.000
level with all these sub-levels merged into one. To keep things organized, you can also create

56
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.960
new folders and name them as you want, like sub-levels or whatever you need. Then you can just drag and

57
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.000
drop the levels you want into them. Now if I click this icon up here, I will be able to

58
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
summon the level details. And I can choose the level I want to spec in either from up here or just

59
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.519
by selecting it in the Level tab. And something really cool that you can do here is adding some

60
00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:48.439
offset to the entire level. And if you click on this Viewport Edit button here, you will be able

61
00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.959
to reposition it directly in the Viewport. Now these changes will be applied to the entire map.

62
00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:59.959
Right now the cube sub-level just contains a cube, but if we had multiple assets, those would be moved

63
00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:06.759
together with it. Alright, we can close this down. So once your desired maps have been added to the

64
00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.279
Level tab and everything is properly organized, you can choose whether you'd like that scene to be

65
00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:18.439
always loaded or loaded via Blueprint. You can access this option by right-clicking on any sub-level

66
00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.959
and then changing the streaming method. Now this can be a little confusing because when working

67
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:29.399
within the Editor Viewport, it doesn't matter whether a level is always loaded or loaded via

68
00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.839
Blueprint. As long as its visibility is turned on in the Levels tab, then it will be displayed in the

69
00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:40.519
Editor Board as we work in our level. The difference though stands in how these levels will be streamed

70
00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:47.159
at runtime, meaning that if we were to either play or I'm just going to click on this hamburger or

71
00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:53.879
simulate, and I'm just going to click on simulate, our map, the always loaded maps will be displayed,

72
00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.839
but the ones that are added via Blueprints will be disabled unless correctly added via Blueprints.

73
00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:06.679
So as you can see here, our cube streaming method is via Blueprint. The Geometry Level is also

74
00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:13.560
loaded via Blueprint and the NDC is also loaded via Blueprint. If we change the Geo Level to be

75
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.239
always loaded and then try to simulate again, you will see that just the cube and the NDC

76
00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:23.959
Level would be disabled because we have no Blueprints actually loading these levels.

77
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:29.079
So unless you plan on setting up a Blueprint to load the levels at runtime, it's a good idea to

78
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:35.719
just set the streaming method of your maps to always loaded. All right, let's go back to the

79
00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:43.479
slides and check out the Stage Monitor plugin. Now, full disclosure, the Stage Monitor doesn't have

80
00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.399
anything to do with level management. They serve completely different purposes,

81
00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:52.039
so I just wanted to point that out. But since this course is designed to introduce you to the

82
00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:56.680
fundamentals of world building for virtual production, we felt it would be important to

83
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.280
mention it nonetheless. The Stage Monitor is a tool that lets you review and manage multiple

84
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.040
computers running Unreal Engine at the same time. This is typically used in a virtual production

85
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.240
setup where you often have many computers working together, one displaying the background of your

86
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:20.759
scene on an LED wall, another editing the scene itself, another for Niagara FX, and so on. The

87
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:26.040
Stage Monitor acts basically like a control center and gives you an overview of what all

88
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.520
these computers are doing. To get started with the Stage Monitor, there are three plugins you

89
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:36.680
need to enable. So let's jump into the Engine and check them out. I'm gonna stop simulating,

90
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:44.440
and then I'm gonna go under Edit, plugins, and then search for Stage Monitor and make sure that

91
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.840
the Stage Monitor plugin is turned on. After that, I will search for virtual production

92
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.519
utilities and make sure that this plugin is turned on. And then there is a third one that is

93
00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:02.040
optional, which is called Switchboard, that in our case is gonna be turned off because we don't

94
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.040
need it. But just so you know, the Switchboard is basically a remote control for all your

95
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.080
Unreal Engine instances across different computers. Okay, we can close this down. And once all of the

96
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.440
required plugins are enabled and the Engine has been restarted, we can go to Windows,

97
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:28.840
Virtual Production, and Stage Monitor. Now in this class, unfortunately, we won't be exploring much

98
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.400
of the Stage Monitor as we don't have any machines synchronized to it and neither any

99
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.640
end display preconfigured. But there is an entire course dedicated to it on our educational platform,

100
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.600
so I'd encourage you to check it out. All right, let's go back to the slides and check out the

101
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.639
Level Snapshots tool. So, Level Snapshots allow you to basically take a picture of your scene

102
00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:57.879
setup so that you can return to it anytime you like. The Snapshots save the exact position and

103
00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:03.320
settings of everything in your World Outliner. You can even choose whether you want to restore

104
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.080
an entire scene back to how it was when you took the snapshot or just bring back some specific parts.

105
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.519
This tool is very useful for virtual production because it lets you revert your changes on the fly

106
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.559
if your Creative Director or DP changes their mind about the look of the scene. It's important to

107
00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:24.679
note though that while Level Snapshots work flawlessly with dynamic lighting or Lumen,

108
00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:29.879
if you're trying to use them with light mess or big lighting, restoring light changes might be a

109
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:35.799
little tricky because the lighting would need to be rebaked at each instance, so it wouldn't be a

110
00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:41.639
very smooth change. All right, let's jump into the Engine and see how the Level Snapshots work.

111
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:50.360
We can close the Stage Monitor and then we want to go to Edit, Plugins, and then search for Level

112
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:56.039
Snapshots. So, the Level Snapshots plugin needs to be enabled in order for us to use them.

113
00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:03.080
After you've restarted the editor and the plugin is enabled, you will find this low icon up here

114
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.879
and right next to it these three dots and if we click on them, we will be able to open the Level

115
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.759
Snapshots Editor. So, before we apply any changes to our map, let's just take a snapshot of its

116
00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:21.480
current stage and we can name it Original Assembly Small, which is the name of the map,

117
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:28.200
and then we want to save it under Levels and I'm just going to add a slash back up to add a new

118
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.600
folder. I don't want it to be saved into any other subfolder, so I'm going to delete this

119
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.840
and the name of the default Level Snapshot is fine. So, let's click on Create Level Snapshots.

120
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.120
Okay, now if we navigate to Backup, we can find the Level Snapshot Asset. All right,

121
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.159
let's apply some changes to this map. So, I'm going to go into my Outliner. I'm going to click on

122
00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:54.759
this cube up here and then I'm just going to move it around. I could also change the material on it

123
00:11:54.759 --> 00:12:01.960
and assign a different one like red, a red material, and I could also just select the directional light

124
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.480
and rotate it around by making it more like the sun is almost setting. Okay, so once I'm done with

125
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.800
my changes, I can either click on this take snapshot button or I can also just click on the one up

126
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:21.879
here in my toolbar and I'm going to call it Dawn Assembly Small. Again, we want to save it to Levels

127
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:30.280
slash backup. We want to delete any further subfolders and then create our Level Snapshot.

128
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:37.319
Okay, perfect. So, now if our DPO director wanted to revert the changes to their original stage,

129
00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:42.919
we could just select our original snapshot by double clicking on it and then restore the Level

130
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:47.720
Snapshot and it would even tell us the actors that would be modified compared to the current settings.

131
00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:52.839
So, let's click on restore Level Snapshot and you will see that all the changes would be applied.

132
00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:57.720
And if they change the menu again and wanted the Dawn, you could just double click on it

133
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.240
and that'll restore the Level Snapshot. Now, these changes were applied to the World Outliner

134
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.960
and it didn't matter whether the assets we changed were in any of these sub levels. In fact, the cube

135
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.480
asset is part of our cube sub level, but we still changed it and reverted it back. That's because

136
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.000
it is part of our World Outliner. But there are certain changes that our Level Snapshots want

137
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.200
to detect. For example, if we were to add a new level to our Levels tab and then take a snapshot,

138
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.200
the Level Snapshot would just detect the changes in the World Outliner, not in the Levels tab.

139
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.320
So, you wouldn't understand these meshes are part of a separate sub level. It would add them,

140
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.960
but to the persistent level. So, you gotta be careful with that. If you apply any changes to your

141
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.000
level management structure, those won't matter in the Level Snapshots. I hope this gave you an

142
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.960
idea of using Level Snapshots in the editor and how you can use it to your advantage in a virtual

143
00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:00.600
production setting. Now, let's go back to the slides to conclude this lesson. Alright, that was

144
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.440
it for this class. And at this link, you can find other extensive documentation and resources to

145
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.279
