00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Hey everyone, how are you doing?

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.560
Ready to learn a bit about editing assets in the engine?

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
All right.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.599
In this video, we'll be focusing on construction blueprint tools to edit assets in our maps.

5
00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.519
Let's get right into it.

6
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.839
So we said construction blueprints, but those blueprints are actually just blueprint classes

7
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.160
or actors, and you can distinguish them in the content browser by their blue bars and

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
little thumbnails with a sphere on it.

9
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.039
We call them construction blueprints because they primarily work in the construction script

10
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.240
graph of our blueprint editor.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.560
Now, keeping it simple, blueprint visual scripting is a node-based visual programming language

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.320
in Unreal Engine.

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.439
And before I said blueprint class, what is it?

14
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:54.640
A blueprint class, often referred to as blueprint, is just an asset that allows you to easily

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.920
wrap some functionality code into it.

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.560
This blueprint asset can be placed into maps and will behave like any other type of actor.

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.760
Now, the construction script specifically is a type of graph in a blueprint class that

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.400
executes when an actor is placed in the editor, meaning in our map, but not during gameplay.

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.000
It basically helps creating customizable tools that improve the artist's workflows.

20
00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.239
And we will take a look at one of them in just a second.

21
00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:30.159
You can also use construction blueprints in conjunction with procedurally generated content

22
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.200
or PCG that we will check out in the next video.

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200
The construction blueprint we will review today is the BP-Crixle Spline scatter and

24
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
was extracted from a Crixle asset pack.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.120
This specific construction blueprint will allow us to add assets along a spline.

26
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.560
So let's take a look at it in the engine.

27
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.519
So if we navigate a little bit higher here and towards the beach of this map, you can

28
00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:02.879
see that if you click on this asset, it's actually a blueprint actor.

29
00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.040
You can see the sphere up here.

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.719
Now if we take a look at its details, we can see down here that we have some meshes assigned

31
00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.759
to this blueprint actor.

32
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.520
And those are the meshes that are actually in populating this spline.

33
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520
Now this construction blueprint will be populated with the static mesh assets we input into

34
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.880
it just like here.

35
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.520
These assets will be instanced into our map.

36
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
What does instancing mean?

37
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240
Instancing basically means that these assets will be copied but in a very specific way

38
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.320
because instancing helps efficiently group identical static meshes into one actor as

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.600
you can see here.

40
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.560
And this helps reducing performance and workflow costs.

41
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040
So let's take a look at this spline.

42
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.879
If you click on this white squares here either at the beginning or the end of this spline

43
00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:00.639
curve, you can either move them directly around into the map and this will either add or decrease

44
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.479
the amount of meshes you see populating our spline.

45
00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.959
Or you can also, you see these little purple squares either here or here.

46
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.919
You can also move those and those are the tangents of the points of the spline.

47
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.439
And the points of the spline are the white squares while the tangents are the purple ones.

48
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.759
If you move around the tangents they will just be impacting the shape of the spline but not

49
00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.599
the length of the spline directly.

50
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.799
In order to do that you will need to move the original white squares.

51
00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.759
Okay, let's try to populate one of these construction blueprints from scratch.

52
00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:42.159
So if you navigate into the content and blueprint folder you can find the blueprint quicksand

53
00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.319
spline scatter tool down here.

54
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.120
And if we drag and drop it into our map you can see that we just get our spline.

55
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.479
Now we have it selected up here quicksand spline scatter tool.

56
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:57.560
And we can start selecting our meshes by clicking on this add element button here.

57
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.000
So let's start with some rock and anything will do.

58
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.879
I will just choose four different rocks now.

59
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.399
Okay, so now if we click on one of the two squares and we start extending it we can see

60
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.920
that the meshes will be randomly populated around our spline.

61
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.279
We can also just move our tangents around.

62
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.719
Now you can see that if you have one of the points selected you don't get access to the

63
00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.600
static meshes or the rest of the details of your construction blueprint.

64
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.439
So make sure to select it directly into the outline in order to get access to these different

65
00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.439
settings.

66
00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.720
Now what else can we do here?

67
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.400
We can also bake these meshes to the level so we can access to them individually.

68
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.100
We can change how they're randomized along our spline.

69
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.600
We can choose the spacing between them, the random rotation.

70
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.200
You would probably need to add very high numbers here like 2000 and then the random scale.

71
00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:11.279
You can also access to further additional transforms by pressing shift on the keyboard

72
00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.279
and clicking on this little arrow here you will be able to expand all the different sections

73
00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.079
of these nodes.

74
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:23.879
And here you can see that you get access to the individual location and node mesh of the

75
00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.919
assets populating our spline.

76
00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.120
Alright, so since we mentioned that I just want to show you really quickly what visual

77
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.360
scripting looks like.

78
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.840
So if I click on edit in blueprint up here in the details panel or here in the outliner,

79
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.960
I will be able to open my blueprint actor.

80
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.080
And here you can see that we have the event graph and the construction script.

81
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.840
We're not going to dive into visual scripting right now, but this was just to give you a

82
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.000
hint on how these tools are developed.

83
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.240
Now let's go back to our slides to conclude this video.

84
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.639
Alright, that was it for this class, but you can find some additional documentation at

85
00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.599
this link if you're interested in further expanding your knowledge in blueprints, specifically

86
00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.120
the construction script.

87
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.240
I'd also encourage you to take a look at our courses focused on blueprinting on our platform

88
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.519
because they will dive into this concept in great details.

89
00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:20.159
Thanks for sticking around and in the upcoming lesson we will look into procedural content

90
00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.240
generation and how to use it in our environment.

91
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.639
Bye!
