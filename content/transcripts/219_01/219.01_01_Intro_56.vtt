Hi, how are you doing?

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.599
My name is Elena Felice and I'm a content presenter for Epic Games.

3
00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.359
It's nice meeting you.

4
00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:15.599
So, in this course, we'll dive deep into worldbuilding for virtual production.

5
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.760
First, we will learn about the concept of derived data cache or DDC, understanding how it works

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.640
in Unreal Engine and in a real-time scenario.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.120
Then, we will dive on a journey learning some basics of the engine,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.560
spanning from lighting to assets editing using different tools like modeling,

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.679
procedural content generation, and blueprints.

10
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.040
We will also learn how to manage levels with the Stage Monitor and level snapshots.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.280
We'll conclude with exploring some material and foliage basics,

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.040
together with checking out the engine profiling tool.

13
00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.039
In the next video, we'll get an overview of our agenda for the upcoming lessons,

14
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.479
as well as learning about derived data cache.

15
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.079
Guess I'll see you there.

16
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.079
Alright, bye.
