00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
You've made it to the end of this course on world building for virtual production.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.179
Congratulations!

3
00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.960
And thank you for being part of this class.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.380
Let's take a moment to review what we learned in the past lessons.

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.600
First of all, we learned about the concept of derived data cache and how Unreal makes

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.800
use of it.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.320
We explored workflows to assess scope when developing our environments for virtual production

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.120
and reviewed how to import external assets into our seeds.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.039
Further on, we also got a quick overview on basic lighting, editing assets, materials,

10
00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.039
foliage, and profiling.

11
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.920
Lots of small bytes of information there, but hopefully they helped you get an overall

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.040
idea over where things are in the engine and how to use them.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.920
Thank you again for sticking around.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.920
I really hope you enjoyed this course and learned a few tricks from it.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240
You're welcome to take a look at the other courses on our platform.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.200
Prefer to expand your understanding of the engine.

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.480
Now I wish you lots of fun building some crazy worlds in Unreal that I can't wait to

18
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.680
see and I'll see you soon.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.180
Bye!
