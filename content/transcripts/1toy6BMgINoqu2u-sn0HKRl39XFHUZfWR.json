  "text": " Okay, so we've got our door opening and closing, it's lurking open nicely, we've got some inputs going on, we've got some more complicated functionality happening and overall we're in a really good place. Now if we just left it there that would be job done, we've got a door opening and closing, but let's take it one step further, let's try and lock the door and create a button that then opens this door. First thing we want to do is we actually want to figure out a way to lock the door and the easiest way to lock a door is by creating a bool. I'm going to call this bool isLocked, isLocked, there we go. I'm going to create a lowercase is and a capital L. Now a capitalized letter in a variable will create a space between the previous letter and the capital letter. So let's just call that isLocked, by default when you create a new variable it will be a bool, if we need to create a different type of variable we've got a whole list of variables here which I'll dig into at the end of this class, by default we would just want a bool in anyway. So isLocked is fine, the only thing I want to do here again for in the aid of good naming convention, organization, when you select the bool in the details panel the category here I'm going to call it door properties. So again capital D, capital P, I'm going to call it door properties in the category and it creates a category down here, it makes things nice and organized and it just keeps things separate for where we need them. So I'm going to compile, save and then what I'm going to do is on the interact I'm going to drag that to the side, I'm going to drag out by a left mouse dragging on the isLocked, same way we dragged the door out before and when you let go you'll see two options, get and set. So we either get the variable or set the variable. For now we're going to get the variable and we're going to set variable in a second, so we want to get the variable. Now a quick way again we love a good shortcut key on the keyboard, if you hold down control and left mouse drag it will automatically get a variable. If you hold down alt it will automatically grab a set variable. So control for get, alt for set, again we don't need those at the moment so we'll just delete them but good shortcut keys to keep in mind. On the isLocked I'm going to drag out of the bool, I'm going to create a branch, I'm going to hit enter on the branch. Again another shortcut is B, so you could hold down B on the keyboard and left click to create a branch but I'm going to create a branch, pressed, isLocked true, you want it to be false, sorry. So is it locked true? Don't do anything. IsLocked false? Well if it's not locked then you can open the door. Now again just for quick debugging we could drag out of here and even though this will turn into a bit of spaghetti it's okay for the purposes now because we're just going to print the string but on true I've just created a print string and you could say in capital letters door locked three exclamation marks just to punctuate that. So I'm going to compile, save, the only last thing I want to do is on door locked I want to set this to true. So I'm going to set this to true and I'm going to compile and save, I'm going to go into my map, I'm going to go over to the door, I'm going to press E and it'll say door locked on the top left there so every time I try to open it no matter what I try door is locked. So cool we've got the functionality there, we've got door locked. I'm going to remove this print string for now and yeah so we've got a door locked functionality and I want to show you how to make those an editable property now in the next video.",
