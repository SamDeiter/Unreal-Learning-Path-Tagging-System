  "text": " In this section, we'll cover adding the logic to our blueprint to allow for player input once the sequence is paused. So back over on our project, let's go ahead and add the logic to our event begin play, particularly between our pause and destroy actor. So I'm gonna go ahead and just disconnect our destroy actor, which you can hold down the Alt key and left click. And we'll just move this kind of out of the way. So after the pause node, let's go ahead and add a gate. And from the gate node, I'm gonna go ahead and move our enter. So from the pause, we don't want it to enter, actually wanna be toggle. Now I can hold down Ctrl, click the little noodle here and move it to our toggle. And then on the gate itself on enter, let's go ahead and just drag backwards. And I'm gonna type in the letter P and start typing in keyboard. That should give us the P key. And essentially what this is going to do is open our gate or toggle our gate once the P key is pressed. And this is what we're gonna use to unpause our sequence when the player inputs. All right, so from the exit on our gate, let's go ahead and drag off of this and add a play. And what we're looking for is we're gonna do play sequence and it may show up, it may not, uncheck context sensitive, and there we go. What we're gonna do are not play sequence, but play. And this is just gonna continue to play the sequence that we have. All right, now from here, our target is still gonna be the main sequence. Now we could drag off of this, we could select it, Ctrl C. Or again, we can grab our main sequence here, drag it onto the target, and you'll see that it automatically creates our translator and our variable. It is essentially the same as what we have here, just we're recalling it and making our graph a little cleaner. All right, and then let's go ahead and reconnect after here, our destroy actor, we'll hit compile. And then one other thing that we need to change real fast is if we leave this logic as is, the problem is because this is an actor in the level and we have this P key, it's not really sure who is pressing this particular key. So to do that, we're gonna go up to class defaults. And then over on the side here, we're actually gonna search for auto receive input. You see here is disabled. We need to change this to player zero and player zero is just the default player that is playing the game. So we'll change this to player zero. And again, doing this will make sure that when the P key on the keyboard is pressed or any key, that is recognizing that it's from the actual player, not a random one. Do that, hit compile and save.",
