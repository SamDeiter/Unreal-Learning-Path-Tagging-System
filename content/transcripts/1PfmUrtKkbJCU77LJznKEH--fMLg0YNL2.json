  "text": " As much as we have concerns over GPU and CPU bottlenecks, bandwidth is also a considerable concern in larger multiplayer games. One vital tool at our disposal is managing relevancy. Relevancy is the umbrella term used to describe how we determine what data is sent to what clients, so what governs whether or not their data is relevant. For instance, if a bullet is fired on the other side of the world, does my local client need to know about it? I'm too far away for it to hit me, and I'm too far away to hear it, and I'm definitely too far away to see its visual effects. In this regard, we can manage the bullet's relevancy in such a way that we can skip sending the bullet over the network entirely, avoiding the needless bandwidth consumption. If an actor spends too long out of relevancy, it will be destroyed, following the same destruction logic we'd experience if we called destroyed directly. When it re-enters relevancy, it'll have its begin play called, as if it's been respawned back into the game. It's worth noting that relevancy works on an actor level, so we can't set a single component to have independent relevancy rules. Relevancy is primarily distance-based, so simply put, it's something too far away from my local client to care. By default, Unreal considers one and a half kilometres too far to be relevant, but that's entirely configurable inside the actor class defaults under the net called distance squared parameter. There's a few instances where we might want to disable relevancy checks entirely, and set is always relevant to true in the class defaults. Typically, we'll use this when developing networked services that should always be accessible to every client, but this is of course down to your particular project specifications. An example of an always relevant actor in vanilla Unreal, however, would be the game state. It's just a replicated actor that every client needs to know about regardless of their current circumstances. Similarly, we might want to enable be always relevant to owner. In this scenario, if we take ownership of something that's too far away, it'll send its data over the network to us. In some circumstances, distance is too broad of a metric to define whether or not something is relevant to the client. We can override the is net relevant for function in the actor to create a custom implementation. So for instance, we may want to say that our actor is only relevant to players assigned to certain teams. If we override the is net relevant for function to only return true when we have a team ID match, we will only send data to that particular player. Whilst distance is the primary means of detecting relevancy for actors, Unreal will also make an actor irrelevant if the root scene component of an actor is hidden and its collision is turned off. While relevancy decides whether or not we should send the dormancy controls whether or not we should even try and send the data. So let's give ourselves a practical example and see how dormant and awake dormancy settings would actually play out. So let's say we've got a cube in the viewport and it's always relevant. Let's also say that the server is changing its color once a second. Given what we already know, we'd expect there to be hundreds of net updates constantly checking to see if the value on the client matches what the server thinks. So in this case, is the server's color the same as the client's color? When we have a mismatch, the new color is sent over the network triggering an on rep, hooking into our color change logic. That's a lot of work for something we know is only going to change once a second. If we change our actor's dormancy setting to dormant, we can all but eliminate those needless net updates by telling the engine directly, hey, I've changed something, please propagate it down to the client for me. All we need to do is call flush net dormancy once we've made a change that we expect to replicate. For this single update, we'll treat this actor as if it's totally active and liable to all the usual relevancy checks. Once we've propagated everything down, the actor will return to its dormant state and await another flush to be triggered by the developer. You should really consider dormancy when implementing network features that only need to replicate their properties when specifically told to do so. So for instance, say we've got a door that can be opened or locked. Once it's unlocked, we can set the B is open build to true and call flush net dormancy. So we don't need to keep checking the state of B is open on the client. As engineers, we know it's only going to change when we specifically tell it to.",
