  "text": " In the previous chapter, we finalized our initial opening shot by creating our camera and the character animations. Now I'm going to go ahead and just close our sequence and go to our content browser and in the sequence 90500, we're going to go to the SEQ, so the sequence one, and I'm going to double click and open our sequence example final. The reason why I want to do this is to show you the final shot that we're creating and what you can do next on your own time for establishing the remaining two shots. So I'm going to select my camera cuts and go ahead and just view through this. And if I play it, you'll see here's our opening shot. And then you'll notice that it will shift to our second shot. And then lastly, the third shot. So these are completely up to you and your artistic interpretation, what you want to build for your shot. But the principles are generally the same. So we're going to have our camera, we'll have our character, we'll have our animations for that character and the key frames that are associated with that. Now on the final one, there's a few other steps that we've gone through to create additional lighting, to create additional movement. All of those things are completely up to you on how you want to build them again to build the shot that you're looking for. And just take note again, we're not going to cover it in this course building the two additional shots. These are up to you to go in and create however you feel.",
