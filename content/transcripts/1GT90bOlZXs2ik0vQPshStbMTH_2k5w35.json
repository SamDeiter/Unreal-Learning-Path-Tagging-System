  "text": " OK, so we have this look working quite well. However, it is quite jerky, where it goes from 0 to 90 degrees quite quickly. Let's see if we can change this in order to rotate more smoothly by using something that's called a timeline. OK, so to start with, I'm going to get rid of this print string here. And in order to do that, it gives me a bit of an opportunity to talk to you about how you can lug and move different pins. So say I wanted to bypass this, I could just drag another line out of the event and plug it into the flip flop. And that would disconnect the first event by just doing that. However, the other option I've got is if I hover over the pin here and hold down the Control key, you can see a little hand appears. This would allow me to connect it up manually and sort of drag it over to the other connection. The other thing that's worth learning is how to disconnect one of these connections. And you can do that by holding down the Alt key and left click, and that will disconnect that. So let's delete this print string now. We don't need it anymore. And let's go over to the right side here. Now, we don't need both these set relative rotations. So let's remove this bottom one here. Now we have the flip flop and it's going into one set relative rotation. In order to move this, we're going to add a timeline. And we're going to add it between the flip flop and the set relative rotation. So if you drag off of the flip flop, drop it down and do a search for timeline. At the bottom, you can see we have an option for add timeline. This is going to automatically create the timeline and plug it in with the set relative rotation connected to the update. Let's name this open slash close door. And move it into a slightly better position here. Now, what a timeline is, is it's going to be a it's going to be a curved data, which would be communicated over a period of time. So what happens is this timeline, the update from this timeline will play on will play on every frame of the game. And any variable or value that comes out of the timeline will be communicated, communicated from here. Let's go into this timeline and have a look. So double click on the timeline here and let's see what we've got. Now, in the top left hand corner here, we have five different buttons. These will be for different tracks that are available within the timeline. The first one is a float track and that's a singular number output. Second one is a vector. So that's three floats usually used to control things in 3D space. Next one we have is an event track. This will allow us to trigger different events off of the timeline. Next one is a color track, allowing us to change colors over time. And the final one is add a selective curve asset. So this is where we could have a curve asset we've created externally and use it in this timeline. We also have a number of different checkboxes here on the right. The first one is use last keyframe. Now we don't have any keyframe setups that's not useful to us at this point. Auto play will mean that this timeline will automatically play even if it is not connected or triggered from from an event or elsewhere. Loop will mean when it gets to the end of the timeline, it'll go back to the beginning and start again. Replicated means that this variable will be replicated across different instances of the game. That's quite good for multiplayer. And the last one is ignore time dilation. Time dilation is Unreal's setup. It allows you to control the speed of time, allowing for things like bullet time or something like that. And by ticking this box, it's going to ignore that entire system. Now, the only section that we're really interested in here is the length. So this is how long this is going to take in seconds. So at the moment it's set to five seconds. Let's change that to one. So you want this door to open and close quite quickly. Right. The next thing we want to do is add a track. We're going to go for a float track because we just want a single variable to come out of this. So go add float track. Now you can see we've created a track. Let's change the name to something slightly more useful. Let's call this door rotation. Since that is the value that we wish to get out of it. Now, we still don't have any keyframes. So let's add some. And you would do this by if you hold down the shift key and left click. It's going to create a keyframe here. Now you can see above this keyframe. I'll have a time and a value section here. Now these are both very close to zero. But let's manually make sure they are zero. So zero, zero. OK. So our starting point of this timeline is zero, zero. Now we want to add in an end keyframe. Come as close to the end as you can. Hold down shift again and left click. It's going to give us our end point. Let's manually change these values to one. And for time and for value, let's make that 90. Now you can see here that the last keyframes actually disappeared. That's because it's gone way up off of the scale of this chart that was originally from zero to point five. Now we can fix that by using these two buttons here. We've got zoom to fit horizontally and zoom to fit vertically. OK, so now it has framed the curve exactly. So the way this curve is going to work is when we are at time zero, the value that is going to be returned is zero. When we are at time one, the value that's going to be returned is 90. And any interval during this is going to return a number between those two values. So if we were running at 120 frames per second, it's going to it's going to fire this into the update 120 times, all with slightly different variables. And we're going to use this on the update. We're going to use this door rotation that's now appeared here to control the relative rotation of the door. Now, as you've noticed, as you may have noticed, this is a float value and this is a rotator. These two will not connect straight away. Now, there is a trick to fixing this. All we need to do is on the rotator node output here, right hand click and select split struct pin. That's going to break this node down into three floats. So as you can see, the only one we really care about is new rotation Z. So let's drag the door rotation off and plug it into the new rotation Z. OK, so that means on update. So this fires every frame of the game. It's going to get the rotation from the curve and get the value from the curve. And it's going to update the door mesh rotation here. Now, there's one more thing I want to do here. And that is the second part of the flip flop. So if we're opening the door, we're going to be playing this this timeline from the beginning to the end. However, if we want to close this door, we're going to play the timeline in reverse by connecting the B up to the R. So we're going to play the reverse setting here. There are a couple of other options here. We could play from the start and reverse from the end. But this means when it's fired, it's going to jump to the beginning or jump to the end. We're a lot better off letting the timeline just control this by itself. It also means if we were to hit reverse halfway through the second, and from halfway through rather than jumping to the end. OK, so now this is connected up. Let's save and compile and press play. Now, you can see if I head towards the door here and press E. The door is opening, closing, opening, closing, opening, closing. See that? And it will just go halfway if need be. So next up, we are going to go back to our event graph because we want to add something else in. We want to add a functionality for a lock. So we want to be able to control if this door is locked or not off of a boolean variable. So in order to do this, let's start off by creating the variable. Come to the variable section and push plus variable. Let's go into create a boolean here. Let's rename this is the door. Is the door. Unlocked. OK, so this is a boolean. At the moment, we have no default value. To get the default value, push the compile button here. And this will allow us access to the default value. Is the door unlocked? We want to set to true. It defaults to false. And if we click true, it will now default to true. In order to get this to run, we're going to have to save. We're going to have to push compile again. So we are compiled. Right. Now, I want to use this variable to control if we can open the door or not. So let's grab the is the door unlocked? Pull it into the event graph and drop it down. That's going to give us a drop down with two options. Get the is the door unlocked and set is the door unlocked. Now, a get is going to allow us to read the value which is in this variable. And a set is going to ask us to change the variable. So in this case, we only want to read the variable. So let's do get is the door unlocked. It's going to bring us up this get node here. Now, if you were to pull off of the get node and search for a branch, it's going to bring up this node here. Now, if you're familiar with programming languages at all, know that a branch is effectively an if statement. The branch is going to look at the variable that's coming into it in this condition. And if this variable is true, it will go down the true line. And if it is false, it's going to go down the false. And this is what we're going to use to lock the door. So on the flip flop, hold down control and let's hold down and connect up the branch before getting to the flip flop. And we only want to open and close the door if this is true. So let's collect the true up to the flip flop. So now, when we do it, when we push E, this is going to check this variable to see if it is true. And then if it is true, it's going to allow us to open and close the door, as we saw before. And if it is false, it's going to go nowhere and do nothing. There's one last thing that I want to do. And that's with this is the door unlocked variable. I want to set the instance editable. You can either do that here or down this line here. What that's going to do is that's going to allow us to set this variable to be different on different instances of the door. I'll just demonstrate this in the viewport now. So save and compile, close this down and go back into the viewport. Now, if you look at this door in the details panel under default, I now have the option is door unlocked? And that's ticked true. So if I take this, I want to duplicate this. So I'm going to hold down the Alt key and drag it out. That'll allow me to create a secondary version of the door. And in this version, I'm going to untick is door unlocked. And so that means this door is set to unlocked and this door is set to locked. Let's give this a go. OK. So on this door, if I push down E, the door will open and close as before. However, on this door, if I push down E, I'm pushing it now. So it's going to do nothing at all. So we can have different instances of the door, which will have different values set and therefore different functionality.",
