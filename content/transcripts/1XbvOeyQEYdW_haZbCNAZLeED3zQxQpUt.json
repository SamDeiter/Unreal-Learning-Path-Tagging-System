  "text": " Okay, so for this exercise I've loaded up from the supplied project one of the levels, the hero end level, and I've deleted all the lights to make sure that we can actually light this up. So let's go ahead and go through the process of creating a scene like this and lighting it statically would look like. So first of all I'll just create some lights to actually get the look that I want. So you'll notice we've already got a directional light that's doing some work but let's go ahead and add some more. So we'll add, let's add a rectangular light in here. I'm gonna go ahead and place it in such a way to get some nice light information here. I'm gonna increase the attenuation, increase the intensity a little bit, there we go. Just gonna move it back a bit and in this case I'm going to also change the source width a little bit so that we get a little bit more light at the back here. Now you'll notice I'm having this one as stationary so that we get that nice direct shadow but I could have it just a static and bake everything so that's something to keep in mind. Let's go ahead and give this a little bit of color as well. Let's go with a slight orange. Keep it nice and subtle. So you'll notice that already because this asset here is, or this scene here is using static lights or stationary lights and real is already telling us hey you need to build lighting right. So all we're seeing here is essentially currently a preview. Let's go ahead and hit it with a bit of light on the backside here and in this case I'll just keep the values the same but make the light maybe blue to get a nice look. I'll do the same over at the back here. Just have a simple three light system here. I might not even cast shadows on this one just to avoid too much shadow changes. So we just search shadow here. Here's a nice option here where you don't have to cast shadows at all. Okay so we have our basic setup now importantly we're gonna need a light mass importance volume. This is a post process volume that's here already so let's go ahead and add our light mass importance volume. And remember this will essentially determine where we will get high quality light mass calculations in terms of indirect lighting. So let's go ahead and make sure that our entire section here is encompassed. So within this we'll get high quality lighting. And now we wanted to change the settings themselves we'd have to find the world settings. So we're gonna go to window and find a world settings. Here we go. And when we go to light mass we've got the options here that we will that we were looking at before in the slide in the slide show that had the number of indirect lighting bounces and that kind of information. So change the values over here if you want to. Let's say for example we choose to have eight bounces instead of three so we get a bit higher quality indirect lighting. And now we're ready to build. So what I'm going to do is go to build and now before I do anything I'm gonna build in preview mode so that I can sort of see if this is gonna look good and then after that if I wanted to I could go higher up. But it's best to first build in preview mode so that you can actually see if there's any issues or errors without having to spend ages waiting for the engine to bake the lighting. So we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna press build all levels you could also build lighting only but in this case I want to build everything so I'm gonna press build all levels and you'll see it will start to set up a connection with swarm which is the offline renderer that will build our light mass. Now you'll notice we're going ahead with it it's now building lighting. If you want to see what's actually happening you can load up the swarm agent so if you just go to your tray here and double click swarm you'll see we have what's actually going on in the light builder. So you see it's color-coded currently it's doing its skylight radiosity and as it compiles all of this you can see we started caching of radiance so collecting some photons and all the information that you see here. Now I'm gonna pause the video because this is going to build and might take a few minutes but we'll come back to see the results. Okay so a few minutes have gone by and Unreal Engine's now finished building lighting so I'm gonna go ahead and close the swarm agent and take a look at what this looks like. So it takes a little bit for Unreal to wake up and see it and you can see we've got kind of artifactly shadows and that's essentially the limitation or drawback of using static lighting and especially when you just build in preview mode. So if we were to build this at a higher lighting quality we would get much nicer shadows but again this is a really good way of previewing for yourself if anything is gonna be wrong and I can see that this looks fine so I would now go ahead and go okay well I'm gonna go and change my building quality to production and then build all levels. Let's go ahead and allow you to do this on your own since it takes quite a while to build in production mode but looking forward to seeing your results.",
