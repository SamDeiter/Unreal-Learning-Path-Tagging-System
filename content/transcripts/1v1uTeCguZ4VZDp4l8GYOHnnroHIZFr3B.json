  "text": " So the Blueprint Editor can be quite overwhelming at first. The way I like to think about anything inside of Unreal Engine is that whatever programs and software you're used to using, you'll realize that you generally default to the similar set of buttons for 80% of your usage. You'll get used to the flow and you won't use 100% of the buttons all the time. So the first thing to keep in mind is don't let the Blueprint Editor interface be too overwhelming. We'll dig into it section by section and you'll find yourself going to the same bits each time. So first thing we see is a classic Windows text menu where you'll be able to find a whole bunch of additional functionality that again you may only use 10% of the time but if you've lost any Windows or you need to file save or you need to edit something, they're the kind of text menus that you'll find up there. The toolbar is something you'll be using quite a lot of the time. You can compile your Blueprints here, you can save your Blueprints, you can browse for other assets within the Blueprint and set a few different other properties like class defaults and things like this. The components window is when we're creating a Blueprint maybe we're creating a player Blueprint or maybe we're creating a door Blueprint. So if we think about the components of a door, maybe we need a door frame, maybe we need a door, maybe we need a box around the door that says the player is within this box. These are all components of a Blueprint and we would add these to the list. It's about selecting the components that you need to make your Blueprint work. In the instance of a character for example, you might have the character's mesh, you might have a weapon that the character is holding, you might have some kind of collision that the player has surrounding them that they can cause to trigger overlap events. Again components are just a selection of these Blueprint functionality that you can create your Blueprints with. In the section 4 we have the Blueprint panel. This is where you'll be adding variables and bits of code and you'll be able to see the graph from a higher level about the kind of inputs that you have here and any kind of main functions. So think of the Blueprint panel as where most of the data is housed. Now if we then go into number 5, this is where all our gameplay scripting actually takes place. You'll see that you can toggle to the viewport in the top left of section 5 here and the viewport will show you in a visual representation the components that you have in your Blueprint. So again, referencing section 3 of the list of your components, then in section 5 at the top left the viewport will help you visualize these components. So if you did select a door with a door frame, you'd be able to see these elements in that viewport. The construction script is something we'll get into in a few minutes again. So slightly more complex concepts but essentially a construction script will fire every time you compile. So again, those familiar with C++ will be more familiar with the construction script but even if you're not familiar with C++, don't worry, we'll dig into that again. And the event graph is where you'll be spending the majority of your time. It houses all the gameplay code that you need for this specific Blueprint 2 function. Don't worry too much about the print text next to the event graph. The print text is a function that we have inside of this Blueprint. You can open the function and edit it and that's more like a quick bar to get to that. So if I close print text, that wouldn't be an issue. We only want to be editing quick context there and the viewport, the construction script and the event graph are the main things to worry about there. And then in section 6, we have the details of whatever we currently have selected. So in this example, we've got a variable selected which is a bool and we can edit some of the default properties of this bool. And so you'll be using the details panel quite a lot in your Blueprint journey and it allows you to add the functionality and customization to the Blueprints that you are creating.",
