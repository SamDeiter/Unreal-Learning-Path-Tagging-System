00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this final video, we'll review some future considerations for our FBX Data Ingestion Pipeline.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Unreal Engine now has a series of plugins referred to as Interchange.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What are these? Well, they're a new import and export framework,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
they're format-abnostic, they're asynchronous, customizable, they can work at runtime,

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and they like some formats better than others.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For example, they work very well with GLTF and OBJ formats, as well as textures.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They can be a little bit more finicky with FBX, but it's certainly worth playing with.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This seems to be the future of how Unreal Engine would like to process various data

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that doesn't go as well through the Datasmith Pipeline, so give this a try if you haven't already.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
To take a brief look at the interchange system, we can see a number of plugins available to us,

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
including OpenUSD, and you'll see that if we navigate further up from our Uproject folder,

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we have an Assets folder with a number of different geometry types available to us.

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Gaunt is our skeletal mesh, we have some 3ds Max textures, and let's try importing a GLTF file.

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So this will come in via that new interchange format with a number of different options,

15
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and this is how we see Unreal Engine beginning to coalesce how it imports different kinds of data.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Data mesh is...

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Ah, and if I wanted that all to be one object, I could try that again.

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I could find the checkbox for Combined,

19
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and then we can find the Combined one here,

20
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's an import using the new interchange system.

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Let's try the same thing with an FBX file,

22
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and we can see the same thing here, interchange generic Assets Pipeline.

23
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We also have some presets, Assets Materials Textures, but whether it's an FBX file, a GLTF, an OBJ, etc.,

24
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this is what we're seeing the future of Unreal Engine imports look like when they're not Datasmith,

25
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a fairly unified list of options using this new interchange system.

26
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And we can see by default our lion here came in with Nanite enabled, perhaps at the wrong scale.

27
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
If we wanted to fix the units, we could go reimport mesh with Dialog, type Unit, and we can see it's in meters,

28
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
so the offset uniform scale, if we want to go from meters to centimeters, can simply be 0.01.

29
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And just noting that if we have Nanite enabled but we're packaging to a platform that does not support Nanite,

30
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Nanite will actually automatically generate a fallback proxy mesh, and you should still have a working project,

31
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
just with slightly less control over how it gets reduced.

32
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I hope you've enjoyed and found something useful about this course on Static Mesh Data Ingestion for FBX.

My name is Alex Coulomb, and I wish you luck on your Unreal Engine journey.

34
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Bye for now.
