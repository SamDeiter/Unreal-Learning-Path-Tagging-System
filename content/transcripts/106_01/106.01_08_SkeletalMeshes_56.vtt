00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video, we'll explore a Skeletal Mesh import pipeline.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Skeletal meshes are different from static meshes.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Like a static mesh, there is a mesh object for the visuals,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but it also has a hierarchical bone skeleton that can drive the animation of the vertices that make that mesh.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The vertices are often weighted to different bones and different amounts,

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and skeletal meshes are usually used, but not always just for created animated characters and organic shapes.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And again, everything from the skeleton to the textures to the animation data and the physics body data

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
can be created over in your DCC tool of choice,

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but Unreal Engine can often generate this on the fly and even let you edit it using the Skeletal Mesh Editor tools.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
When we import a Skeletal Mesh into Unreal, if we leave the Skeleton field blank,

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it will use the Skeleton that comes with the FBX file or generate one,

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but we can also select an existing Skeleton if we would like to ensure that this Skeletal Mesh will conform to an existing Skeleton.

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Once we have a Skeletal Mesh in our project, we can begin to animate it, and I'll show you a few different ways of doing that now.

14
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If we open up the map called Gaunt, we'll see a Skeletal Mesh Actor imported via FBX.

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We see it came with a physics asset, its skeleton, as well as textures and materials.

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The physics asset again gives us a sense of how it will collide with geometry,

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
similar to the collisions we were looking at before, and like those collisions, this is simplified.

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If we take a look at its skeleton, we can see a fairly standard set of bones here.

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If we'd like to, we could visualize all the bones and even start to adjust to see how they move

20
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and how adjusting one bone affects parents and children.

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
However, if we want to see this with an animation right now, we'll find that if we choose Animation Asset, nothing is available

22
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because there are no animations set up for this particular Skeleton.

23
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Luckily, if you recall earlier, I did bring in this Zombie Animation Pack,

24
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we should also have some animations from our third-person template down here, for example, Run Forward.

25
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So there's a very robust animation retargeting pipeline in Unreal Engine now, so allow me to demonstrate that for a moment.

26
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I'll sort this by animation sequence, and I can just select any of these to begin, right-click,

27
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and yes, I could do Replace Skeleton, which could give me mixed results, but I'm going to go ahead and choose Retarget Animations.

28
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And so right now, we can see the source Skeletal Mesh for these animations is actually the UE4 Manny.

29
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Let's stick with UE5 to keep things simple for now.

30
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I think we can see a UE5 Manny right there, so I'll go Retarget Animations, there he is, UE5 Manny,

31
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and the target Skeletal Mesh is going to be gone.

32
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So we see the two standing side by side, and yes, I could do all of these animations one by one,

33
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but to start, I'm going to export a retarget asset.

34
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And this retarget asset, I'll put into my temp folder,

35
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and it will create this auto-generated retargeting system that will try to match Manny's movements to Gaunt.

36
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And if I wanted to test this briefly, I could open up any of these animations

37
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and see how the two of them respond together to the same animations,

38
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
even though they actually have different skeletons, and we can see it's working pretty well.

39
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Let's also try one of the more standard ones, like a walking animation,

40
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
although I guess that is a little bit zombie focused.

41
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Another idle animation, that's an idle animation, sure.

42
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And yes, from there, I could select any number of these animations.

43
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I'll just do the attack ones here, and I can do export selected animations,

44
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
put them in my temp folder.

45
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I have the option here to do some prefixes and suffixes,

46
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and just go ahead and leave it as is, and do export.

47
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now I have these animations, as we can see by the thumbnails, targeted to our Gaunt character,

48
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and I can even test them here in the editor by selecting one of them

49
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and then going to update animation in editor.

50
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It's looking pretty good there.

51
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
In the next video, we'll look at some future considerations for our FBX workflow.

52
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Thank you for watching.
