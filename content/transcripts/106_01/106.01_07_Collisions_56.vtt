00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, we'll look at collisions.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Oftentimes, when we're importing into Unreal Engine,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we'll have a checkbox available to us that asks

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
if we would like to generate missing collisions.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This will tell Unreal Engine that when we're walking around a scene,

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
especially in, for example, a third-person character template,

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that we should bump into and not go through certain kinds of geometry.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As we see in the bottom right,

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we can also have collisions set up manually,

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in this case, just affecting the columns,

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is particularly useful if we have more complex geometry

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
above the height that a character will be able to access,

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and there's no reason to have collision data there.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To give your CPU a break, it's always ideal to keep your collisions

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as simple as possible, but if your platform can handle it,

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
there are also very simple ways to make all the geometry

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
just match the same collision data as the geometry itself.

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here's an example of modeling a custom collision box

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
over in a DCC tool.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You can see that it's much simpler than the geometry inside of it,

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but will still allow more complex collisions

22
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
than something like a simple box or sphere.

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These collision meshes can import into Unreal Engine automatically

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as long as they follow the naming convention of the prefix

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
ucx underscore, full mesh name, underscore number.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's take a look at the collisions map in Content Maps,

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
where we'll see that we've got a simple wall

28
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
with a hole cut through it,

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
some various objects on the ground, and some columns.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So if we go ahead and start by looking at our Flayer collision,

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we can see that these are already set up

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in a pretty useful way that gives us a good sense

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of how collisions should work.

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So if we think our character is going to be able to hit the top of this wall,

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of course, we want this tab collision,

36
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
whereas with the much taller columns,

37
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we probably don't need to go above the height that the player could jump or reach to,

38
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so this is perfectly fine.

39
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There's no need to get into the details of every nook and cranny of these columns.

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Down here, we want these, of course, to be a little bit more convex.

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And so these are set up just enough to be able to block the player

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in a more robust way than a simple cube or sphere would be able to.

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Let's take a look at these a little bit closer.

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So if I open up Cart Damaged,

45
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and I view the collision here,

46
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we can see that this was set up as a convex element.

47
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So if we wanted to try creating something like this ourselves,

48
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we could go and remove collision,

49
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and then try doing this with auto-convex collision.

50
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It'll ask us what we want the whole count and the max vertices to be.

51
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I can hit apply, and it will give us something actually a little bit more detailed

52
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
than the one we just had.

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If we wanted to simplify it,

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we could say remove collision,

55
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
make the whole count to max-hole vertices 8,

56
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
hull precision 10,000, hit apply,

57
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and there we are with a simpler piece of collision geometry.

58
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is different from the other cart over here,

59
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
where the collision data was actually brought over from its origin,

60
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I believe in 3ds Max.

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And you can see the way this was modeled

62
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is quite different from how Unreal Engine would automatically process this kind of data.

63
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
For our simple wall,

64
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we might want to see what the existing collision data is,

65
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but once we click here, we'll see remove collision is grayed out.

66
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's because this does not actually have any collision data.

67
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We have no primitives, no convex elements.

68
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
What's happening here is we have collision complexity

69
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
set to use complex collision as simple,

70
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which means that it'll use the exact geometry here as collision data,

71
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
which isn't too bad because there's only 44 triangles and 76 vertices in this entire object.

72
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It would be much more expensive if we did something like that with the colonnade here.

73
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So we went down to the same thing and said,

74
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
collision complexity, use complex collision as simple and save that.

75
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We could test to see that it's working with player collision.

76
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And now we're putting a lot more load on the CPU,

77
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
even though it's very unlikely if we've got a standard third-person game, for example.

78
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's very unlikely a player would be encountering colliding with the cornice of the columns.

79
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So we could go back here,

80
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
change this back to project default,

81
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and if we wanted to, we could view the current collision

82
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and try modeling this ourselves.

83
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So I could select each of these and delete them,

84
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or just to remove collision at the start of that.

85
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And now I could go ahead and add a box or, you know, let's say to make it a little different.

86
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Maybe I want to do a capsule because this is a little bit more rounded.

87
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So I could do a capsule and I'd scale that down using my traditional hotkeys of Q, W, E and R.

88
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Get this at a height.

89
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Turn off some of my snapping, maybe.

90
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Get this at a height that I think is reasonable for my particular use case.

91
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Put it roughly there into the column.

92
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's actually a pretty good fit.

93
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I could fine-tune this, of course, if I wanted to,

94
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
by looking in some orthographic views,

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
maybe in a wireframe mode, something like this.

96
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Yeah, that looks pretty good.

97
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I could make it a little bigger if I wanted to.

98
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But the other thing here is I can hold down Alt and drag this out to duplicate this

99
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and create another collider right there.

100
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So if I go ahead and save that now,

101
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we can now see that my new colliders, these capsules,

102
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
are existing here in place of the cubes that were there before.

103
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
In the next video, we'll look at a skeletal mesh import pipeline.
