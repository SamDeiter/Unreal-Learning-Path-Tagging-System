00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
In this video, we'll explore some considerations for preparing your assets in your DCC Tool

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.400
of Choice.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.960
Before exporting, you're going to save yourself a lot of headaches on the Unreal Engine side

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.440
if in your DCC Tool, by the way, DCC stands for Digital Content Creation, you set up

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.179
things with clear names and materials.

6
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.660
We recommend looking at Michael Aller's UE5 Style Guide, which is a perfect example for

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.820
a wide range of naming conventions that are actually quite well accepted throughout the

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.179
industry now.

9
00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:38.460
Be sure your scene is well organized and combine and attach meshes ahead of time when you can,

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.500
which will simplify how they get imported into Unreal.

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.900
Pay attention to any objects that have been scaled, especially in a non-uniform way.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.799
Look for tools that reset the scales, x-forms, etc. whenever you can.

13
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.840
Keep the scenes as close as possible to the world origin of 000 as when they get too

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.700
far away it can start to create floating point errors.

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.960
And then whenever it makes sense, set up your pivot points ahead of time so when they come

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.659
into Unreal Engine, they're not far away.

17
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.600
Basically a similar comment to what we're saying about the origin of the world, but

18
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.560
on a per-object basis instead of for the entire scene.

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.740
A reminder that Unreal Engine uses the Z-axis for up and the unit type is centimeters, and

20
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.739
whenever possible you should try to set this up in your DCC tool before exporting, although

21
00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:31.859
Unreal Engine is getting better and better at identifying the up direction as well as

22
00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.619
the unit type from a variety of sources and converting them on the fly.

23
00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.619
Still, this remains a best practice, especially if you don't want to deal with scaling issues.

24
00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.519
If we take a brief look at the Forklift Scale Map found in Content Maps Forklift Scale,

25
00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:53.920
we can see an example of our little Forklift brought into Unreal, and we might not know

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.199
right away that it's little without context.

27
00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:02.159
Standing next to it is a third-person character at its normal scale, and we can see of course

28
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.840
this feels a lot more like a child's toy now.

29
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.519
The problem here was that this was imported with inches instead of centimeters, whereas

30
00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.759
the correct imported Forklift is over here, and as we can see next to our character, it

31
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:22.000
is at the correct scale because it was imported with centimeters set up correctly.

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.399
You'll find that when you first bring in an FBX file into Unreal, you'll be presented

33
00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:31.679
with a wide range of options for how you would like that FBX data ingested, including things

34
00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.039
like whether or not you would like to generate collisions, combine meshes, whether or not

35
00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.399
you want to convert to Nanite, what you want to do with normals, if you'd like to change

36
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.919
the units, if you'd like to generate light maps, if you'd like to set up LOD groups,

37
00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:50.000
if you'd like to convert the materials, and the list goes on and on.

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.039
And so again, before this all comes to Unreal, in your DCC tools such as 3ds Max, it's good

39
00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.439
to set up things like a standard naming convention.

40
00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.439
Here is the current state of the Michael Aller style guide.

41
00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.599
It says UE4, but it works exactly the same for UE5.

42
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.799
You'll see some basic principles in here, and then some very direct approaches for how

43
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.000
things get named, for example a prefix of SK for skeletal mesh, M underscore for material,

44
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.960
T underscore for texture, and so on and so forth.

45
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.800
Here we see the example of ensuring that you don't just have a bunch of objects named box

46
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.600
rectangle shape, and instead they're named things like bench, handle, floater, etc.

47
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.760
As we see that those translate over into the Unreal Engine Outliner.

48
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:42.519
Keep in mind that if you have an object with multiple materials, that object will translate

49
00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.359
into Unreal Engine with those same material slots listed as different elements.

50
00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.359
These material IDs will determine which faces get which textures and materials, and the

51
00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.439
more material IDs that a mesh has, the more expensive it'll be to render as every single

52
00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.799
one of those materials will create an additional draw call, also known as a rendering pass.

53
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.640
Then the raft map, which we can find under maps raft, we have a simple example of different

54
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.280
material IDs set up as they came into Unreal via an FBX import, and we have gray, brown,

55
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.800
black, red, silver, and then we have a hey raft that seems to have come in at the wrong

56
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.920
scale, and then over here one where all those materials have been combined to reduce draw

57
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.160
calls and add additional optimization.

58
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.200
This could be done in a DCC tool, though it could also be done directly in Unreal Engine

59
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:51.400
via something like actor merge actors simplify.

60
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.360
And then we have this other version of the raft, which actually has combined all those

61
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.840
materials together, reducing from five draw calls to one.

62
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
Pivot points determine where an object will get placed in a level, as well as how it will

63
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.960
scale and rotate relative to that pivot point. Typically you want a pivot point to be located

64
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.040
at the ground level of an asset so that it will easily place on the floor of your project

65
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.080
and somewhere near the center. By default, if the pivot point is centered to the object

66
00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.519
but the object is offset from the center of the world, that pivot point will be relocated

67
00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:35.319
to Unreal Engine's origin, zero, zero, zero, but you can prevent that from happening by

68
00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:42.240
activating the bake pivot in vertex option when you import through the FBX dialog box.

69
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.439
Let's take a look at our pivot points by opening up the pivot map in our content maps

70
00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:53.319
folder. And from here we'll see two forklifts, one with the name pivot bad, and one with the

71
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.120
name pivot good, hopefully for obvious reasons. We can see that pivot bad has its pivot all

72
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.159
the way over here and is a little bit awkward to move, and once you start to rotate it,

73
00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:10.319
things get very confusing very quick. Over here on the other hand, much easier to move,

74
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:18.199
and rotation makes a lot more sense. So how do we fix the bad pivot forklift to make it

75
00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.620
closer to the good one? Well, if we go into our modeling tools here, which also have the

76
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:30.540
shortcut of shift F5, we can go down here to X form, edit pivot, and we have a number

77
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.899
of different options here where we can center, put it up top, put it to the right, put it

78
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.819
over in the world origin, or put it in the bottom. We can adjust all this manually of

79
00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.420
course as well. If we think that we want it to be near the front of the vehicle, for example,

80
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.939
or if we're thinking about how the vehicle might begin to rotate, whether it's a front

81
00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:54.019
wheel drive or rear wheel drive, that might actually start to influence what we do as

82
00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:58.339
well. Now that I'm looking at the forklift, I realized I was looking at it backwards,

83
00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:03.379
front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, and once I accept that, so for example, if it has rear

84
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:09.019
wheel drive, we could have something like that happening. And this doesn't affect just

85
00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:14.500
this one instance of the model. If I go and I find the pivot bad model here, we've actually

86
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.379
adjusted it at its base mesh level. As we can see, this new one we've just dragged in

87
00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:26.300
also has the pivot in that location. So this is different from the option of right clicking

88
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.579
and going to our pivot and doing a pivot offset, right? That is something that is temporary,

89
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:38.819
and we'll go away once we click on the object again. Also note that when you import into

90
00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:44.819
Unreal Engine, you can import an entire scene instead of just an individual object. Nowadays,

91
00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:50.620
we're seeing this done even more and more, not just with FBX, but also GLTF, GLB, and

92
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.539
USD files as well. What's quite nice about this is you can actually get a preview of the hierarchy

93
00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.300
before you import it. You can import components and preserve the hierarchy and pivot points of

94
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.339
individual actors. You can import components into a single blueprint actor class. You also have

95
00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:10.659
separate tabs for static meshes and skeletal meshes if they're part of the same scene,

96
00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:15.819
and you have a robust materials menu to adjust how those all come into your project.

97
00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:24.099
If we take a brief look at our forklift hierarchy scene, we can see that an entire blueprint has

98
00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:30.500
been generated that contains the entire hierarchy of the FBX scene as it came into Unreal. So if I

99
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:37.139
open up that blueprint file, I will see all the geometry in here set up very similarly to how

100
00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:42.980
it was created in its original DCC tool, clearly with some attention paid to things like pivot

101
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:50.620
points and even how the tire would rotate. If you like, we could test this very briefly in a level

102
00:08:50.620 --> 00:09:01.899
sequence by bringing in our forklift, adding in a transform track, changing where it moves from

103
00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:13.500
here to about frame 150, setting this to be a linear speed and seeing if we can get the tires to

104
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:36.539
rotate appropriately. Double clicking on a blueprint will actually bring you right to the child

105
00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:42.460
component. Here though I have the wheel selected, I probably actually want to have the rear right

106
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:49.180
and the rear left control points selected. I could set their rotation, move forward a little bit,

107
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.620
and then bring their rotation perhaps to something like 180 degrees.

108
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:09.100
And we can see those tires in the back are moving. Now note I can't actually do this with the other

109
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.860
wheels directly because they do not actually have these same control points. And if I click on the

110
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:22.379
wheels directly, the pivots are not in the center of the wheels, they're over here. So I could continue

111
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:28.300
to work with this and modify it here in Unreal, or I could change it back in my DCC tool. But here's

112
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:35.019
just a very quick example of what I was able to do just by bringing this over into Sequencer and

113
00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:40.939
working with the existing hierarchy. In the next video, we'll explore Triangle Count.
