Hello, and welcome to this course on FBX data ingestion for Unreal Engine version 5.6.

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.120
My name is Alex Coulomb, I'm an Unreal Engine authorized instructor, course author, and

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.640
I run the XR Creative Studio Agile Lens immersive design.

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.679
In this course series, we'll be looking at static mesh ingestion using the FBX file format.

5
00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.039
For our agenda, we'll begin with the simplest way to import FBX files and other assets,

6
00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.799
which is actually to use FAB, taking data from the cloud.

7
00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:38.759
Then as we consider bringing our own assets from our DCC tools into Unreal Engine, we'll

8
00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:43.879
begin to explore a number of considerations, such as units and scale, naming conventions,

9
00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.600
how to combine objects, setting up material IDs, and looking at pivot points, which can

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.519
be changed both in the DCC tool and in Unreal Engine.

11
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.400
From there, we'll look at triangle count, both an LOD level of detail approach, as well

12
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.960
as nanite.

13
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.400
After that, we'll explore adjusting assets in Unreal Engine using the modeling tools,

14
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.920
considerations for UVs, especially when baking lightmaps, setting up collisions, best practices

15
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.640
for importing skeletal meshes, and then we'll wrap up with some future considerations for

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
your FBX workflow.

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.400
In the next video, we'll look at how to import FAB assets from the cloud.
