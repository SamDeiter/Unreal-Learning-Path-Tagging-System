00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
In this video, we'll explore importing FAB assets from the cloud.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.800
Before we dive too deep into importing our own custom FBX assets from our DCC tools,

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.720
it's good to know how to get data from the web.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.600
FAB is a one-stop shop that uses Unreal Engine directly in the editor to add a wide variety

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.960
of assets, meshes, textures, etc. directly into your project.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.039
When you find a FAB asset you like, you can add it to your library or just temporarily

7
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.880
add it to the project to see what you think of it.

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.120
For example, as long as I have the FAB plugin active, if I pull up my content drawer, I

9
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.719
can go to the FAB icon here, click on it, and see FAB load not in a separate web browser

10
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.840
but directly inside of Unreal Engine.

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.000
Then if I wanted to find, for example, some animations and sort only by free options,

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.240
I might find something useful for my particular project.

13
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.359
Maybe we want to make sure that these are relatively recent files, and then we could

14
00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:18.080
grab something like these nice free zombie animations from QuackAvoid.

15
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.959
I can add to my project without adding it to my library if I just want to test them

16
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:37.159
out and see what I think of them.

17
00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.840
Now without actually having to go through a more traditional import process, I now have

18
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.280
a folder called Zombie Animation Pack full of animations with that nice handy FAB icon

19
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.520
to show us where these came from.

20
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.080
Be careful when downloading potentially large files like Megascan assets.

21
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.439
If you choose something like raw data, it's likely to be 8K and very, very huge files.

22
00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.400
You'll see oftentimes when downloading you actually have options for things like an

23
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.080
FBX file format versus GLTF, and in many cases you'll get little previews of their

24
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080
sizes.

25
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.159
This is if you want the raw data.

26
00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.800
This is if you want the file types directly, including zip folders of various textures.

27
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.960
But again, this is only if you need that source data and don't want to bring it directly into

28
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.920
your project.

29
00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:52.479
For example, if I search for Quixel African, I can see the African slate query here.

30
00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:57.000
And if I go to the website, I can access these direct raw files.

31
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.039
From over an Unreal Engine, I only have access to add this directly into my Unreal Engine

32
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.360
project, not to download it directly.

33
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.800
And yes, note again that over in my FAB settings, I can choose my preferred quality tier when

34
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.439
adding directly into my Unreal Engine project.

35
00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.920
Keep an eye of course on your cache directory size.

36
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.759
If this number becomes too large for your taste, you can clean that directory at any time

37
00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.319
or move the location to a larger drive.

38
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.840
In the next video, we'll go over some DCC considerations.
