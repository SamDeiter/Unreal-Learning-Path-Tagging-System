  "text": " In this part of level editing, I want to talk about building the minimap. Now, there are a couple of things that we need to do in order to get our world partition minimap to work. And that setup is actually fairly easy. It just is not well known. And the one thing that we really need to do is put in something called the world partition minimap volume. Once we place this into our level, we should scale it to the size of our landscape. And this is really going to help us ensure that we are only capturing the area that we want. Inside of our world partition minimap that is placed inside of our level, we can select that. And then we're going to have a bunch of different options. Under here, we have things like our world unit per pixel, which allows us to increase or decrease the size of the capture and world units that we are going to capture. We then have our builder cell size, which allows us to adjust the size of the individual grids that are used when we grid this up and build the sections for it. As this isn't built as one giant texture, but it is built with virtual textures in mind. So it is built in quadrants and then streamed in as one massive texture underneath build cell size. We have capture source, which allows us to do many different things. You notice that it is a drop down menu. And from this menu, we can select a whole bunch of different options in terms of how the minimap texture is actually output. Last but not least, we have capture warm up frames. And if you notice, this is actually set to 10 in this example. This allows things like world partition, nanite and other systems time to stream in and warm up as the capture happens and eliminates seams that are in the system. And it creates seams that could be shown inside the ending artwork. So let's pop over to the editor now and check out how this works. So first off, what we're going to do is I have a world partition minimap here. So this is the minimap and this is going to be added by default. But what we need to do is come in here and add a mini world partition minimap volume. For me, what I'm going to do is I'm going to zero this out and I'm going to hit F to kind of focus in on this. And we want this to cover our entire massive landscape. So we're going to scale this thing. Actually, I'm probably going to do something like this. And let's do well, probably need to be like five thousand, I think. Well, five thousand is a little bit too much. Let's just scale this back in. We'll say like five hundred and keep scaling this in just a little bit. We want it right on the edges there. It looks about right. So about two thousand and then we're going to do the same thing over here. So probably just scale us out to two thousand. And then here we're going to do like five hundred and we want to make sure that. Yeah, that looks about good. We want to make sure that this is not there's nothing like, you know, sticking out or sticking. Not covered by the volume of bottom of the volume, but also nothing not covered by the top. We don't want, you know, like this part of the landscape sticking out of the top or it'll get cut off. We want to make sure everything is inside of there. So there we go. We have that all set up. This is great. So the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to come down to our I shouldn't say come down, but we're going to locate our World Partition minimap. There we go. And then what I'm going to do is say my warm up features. I'm going to set this to ten. And right now I am just going to come up here and do a build. And we're going to do World Partition editor minimap. And so I'm going to save all this and we will be right back once this builds because this will take a second the first time we do a build here. All right. So our build is done now. So if I click over to World Partition, check this out. This is what we have right here. So this is actually this house that's right over here. Wait, where'd the house go? I can't even find it. So let's just go like this and go move camera here. There we go. So that's our house. So there we go. And if we come back to our World Partition minimap, there's a couple of other things in here. So notice we have this excluded data layers. If we were to add another element here and we are not actually using any data layers in this project. But what we could do is the data layers that we do use, we could use these to exclude that particular content. So if we know that we don't want something on the World Partition map, we can exclude that here. One of the other things that we can do again is change our world units per pixel and our builder cell size to give us increased or decreased resolutions. I'm going to actually set this to 20 and then I'm going to come here and I'm actually going to change this to my final HDR and linear color space. Actually, no, I'm sorry. Take that back. We're going to do this scene color. This is the one I think in RGB and opacity and a there we go. This one right here. Sorry about that. And then we're just going to come up here to build and we are going to build our World Partition minimap editor. So just save that real quick and we will be right back once this builds to see the difference. All right. So our level is done. Let's pop over to our World Partition and we can see here we've got a couple of changes and now we're seeing some more interesting details inside of here. So we've got our some shading from our house here and different shading from our environment. One of the other cool things if we hit control alt and L and we kind of adjust this, maybe we give it some longer shadows. We're actually going to see this reflected inside of our build here because the light that is captured for this is actually directly captured from the level. And that is to change that if you don't want that, that is where if we come here to get into our World Partition minimap and then change our capture source, we can adjust this accordingly to what we want. So that is how we utilize building our minimap so that we can have a great representation of what's going on inside of our level. I'll see you in our next lesson.",
