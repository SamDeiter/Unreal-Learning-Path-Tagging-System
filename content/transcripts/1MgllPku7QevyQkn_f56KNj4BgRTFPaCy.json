  "text": " The next thing that we'll tackle is roughness to get some of that shine in and we'll grab the parquet roughness and the gold roughness. And we'll combine these with alert and we use alert because we want to get both of these roughness maps, the values for roughness. We want to get their values in and we will also need the alpha channel that comes with alert. Pull down the L key and left click to get alert and we'll tie the RGB into the A channel of the floor and the gold RGB into the B channel. And we will want to filter it by our mask. And so we'll take the output from our 1 minus and pipe it into the alpha channel. And we can see here that we're getting just the result we want. And if we tie this in to our roughness, our floor will have its polish, high gloss polish. So it has its shine, but the gold does not yet have its shine because the mask is filtering the gold out. To get its shine in, we'll use the metal channel for that. And we'll take the gold metal. Let's zoom out a bit and let's make this full screen while we're at it. And so we'll fix the shininess of our gold by using the metal input, the metal channel. So for that, we'll use our gold metalness map. And to reduce the sort of overlaps, crossing of streams, noodle fest that we have going, we'll select these masking nodes, the mask and the 1 minus. And with both of those selected, if we move our cursor to where we will want to use those, if you press control W, it will copy the selected nodes to the new location with their values. So again, we'll be using a LERP to basically to filter our maps and our gold metalness through the map. So hold down the L key, left click, LERP. And to cap how much of an input it has, we'll use a constant for the A channel. So if we hold down the L key, we'll use the constant for the A channel. So if we hold down the L key, the how much of an input it has, we'll use a constant for the A channel. So if we hold down, we only need a single constant. So if you just hold down the 1 key and left click, you get a one constant, which for now we'll leave it 0. 0 being the shiniest, 1 being least, well, metallic, I should say. And we'll take the RDB values from our metal map and pipe that into the B channel, pipe the constant into the A channel and filter it all through the alpha channel by using our map. And we see here that the only things that are really sort of lighting up are the outlines and the diamonds. And when we feed these, the results of our metal into our metal, metallic, now we're seeing shininess on the gold as well. And lastly, we'll set up the normals. Let me grab marquee select these to grab these and pull these out of the way so we have more space to work with for the normals. Oh, and we have our dangling specular map. So before we do the normals, I just want to mention something about the specular map. As I've mentioned previously, and as you may recall, if we look at the result note, we see that specularity is a value between 0 and 1. And way over on the right side of this tooltip, it says the default is at really the halfway point, 0.5. This being the case, it doesn't actually have a default. It's a value between 0 and 1. And so we can see that the this being the case, it doesn't actually use color values. This does have a very distinct color value to it the way other programs do. And so even though Quixel's provides this map with its mega scans for gold, we have no use for it because our specularity is determined by the light surrounding the mesh, surrounding the object. And so color values don't apply. If this map had different texture values in RGB, then it would filter the specularity through those. You could set up a system for doing that as we have in other places. But just for specularity itself, if it's a solid color as this is, it doesn't actually mean anything. But they do provide it because Quixel mega scans are used in many other programs, many other applications. So it's great that they have it, but we don't actually need it. It doesn't actually, not important here. So I'm just going to delete it and let you know that you may have access to specular maps when you are downloading materials from mega scans. But much of the time, you don't actually need them. I'm just going to delete it. Okay, so that leaves us with setting up our normals. And for that, we'll need to filter our normals through our mask. So that the right map applies to the right part of the map. And so for that, we'll be using alert and just filtering it straight through not the inverted version, but just the map itself. Not the inverted version, but just the map itself. So hold down the L key, left click, Lerp. Let's select the map by itself and move our cursor to the normals area that we've set up and control W to copy it. And we'll just take the parquet floor part of RGB, pipe it into A, the gold normal into B, and the RGB mask into the alpha. And then pipe the result of our normal system and pipe it into normal. And now we have our completed gold floor.",
