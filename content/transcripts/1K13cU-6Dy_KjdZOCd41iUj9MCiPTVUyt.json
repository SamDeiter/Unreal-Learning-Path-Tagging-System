  "text": " Next, let's talk about a few cool techniques we can do with camera transitions inside of Unreal. So, we've got a crossfade using a material instance and a scene capture component. So let's talk about the crossfade creation here. So we've got the render target texture and they're attached to the scene capture component texture target of each Xfade underscore cam. So the Xfade underscore cine cam views the render target via the instance material attached to the Xfade and the slow control plane. And it essentially allows us to mimic what we would do a crossfade in an engine with. So if we go into the sequencer here, and again, we'll show you this in engine to show it actually working. But you can see the material setup if you want to load it yourself. You can see this is just essentially lerping between two different texture samples over some kind of parameter, which in this instance is called the Xfade. So the sequencer creates a crossfade transition by animating the alpha of the one of the texture samples through the scale of material parameter. So you can see the setup there. We'll jump into engine now and break that down so you can see exactly what's going on. And so we're back in our editor now. If we just type in M underscore Xfade, we'll find the material that's been set up here. And so you can see the basic setup. We've got a texture sample where we've got a texture Xfade underscore O1, and then we've also got O2. If you actually select these textures in your content browser by searching, I'll just pin my window up here, it'll go to the location of the textures. And when you have a texture selected, you can go back into the material and just hold down T and left click. And because that texture is already selected in the content browser, it's going to bring that in for you there. So that's how you bring in a texture sample. And then to create a, this is called a const one. So we hold down one on our keyboard, we left click and we get this kind of property here. And then you see in this box here that it says param in bracket zero. So we want to change this to a parameter so we can right click convert to parameter and then we can give it a name like Xfade. I'll just call this fade for now because there's already an Xfade there. But you kind of get the idea is giving it a name that we can actually then call inside of a sequencer or a blueprint, the visual scripting language. And then the lerp is just right click lerp and that's called a linear interpolate. So that's this option here. And then you see that we're basically blending between A and B over the alpha, which is this. So zero to one over the alpha. And then we just make it an emissive color, which you can set the properties for here. So this shaded model is set to unlit, which means that all of these other options are grayed out. And so that's basically the texture sample and how to set this material. So hopefully Xfade gives you a bit of an idea about how to start using the tools inside of Unreal Engine to get the camera techniques you need. This one is using a wipe effect using material function and a scene capture component. So sequence needs a little mathematical assistance in order to control the wipe transition here. So that's where a material function comes in to replace the Xfade parameter. So we've got the setup here. We'll jump into it again in project so you can see exactly what's going on. What we'll be doing here is we'll be using the wipe modification. So the render target textures are all attached to the scene capture components in a similar way. So this one's called wipe underscore cam. And then the wipe underscore cine cam views the render targets via instance materials attached to the wipe underscore control plane. So that's the basic setup there. And you'll see that we're using a material function and scene capture components here. So the sequencer will use the material parameters created through the material function to add direct control to the wipe transition. So we can control these essentially via the key frames inside of sequencer. So parameters are exposed in sequencer and animated to manipulate the alpha of one of the wipe cam texture samples replacing the crossfade parameter. So again, it's worth digging into these materials. They're relatively basic materials, but we're doing complex functionality inside of Unreal Engine. So don't worry about actually understanding how to set them up yourself. More so these can be tools in your project settings where once they're set up once, you can just reuse them many times depending on the situation. But let's jump in engine and let's show you exactly what's going on here now. So first, we want to go back to our content browser. And this material was called M underscore wipe. And then we just want to make sure we're in the higher level content folder just to make sure we find the white material. And then when we open it up, you can see exactly what's going on here. So we've still got our linear interpolate. And this time, we're coming off a expression material function call, which are these then similar to how we've created before. We've got the const, we've got a texture V3 here, and then we've also got the wipe direction. So it's a little bit more complicated. The good thing about materials as well is that you can actually copy and paste these into your own projects. So if you selected these options and control C, control V into a new material, you could actually get this set up and how to replicate it. So it's always good just knowing where these materials are and working backwards from how to create a material. It's also probably worth noting that this is a function. So we actually call a material function. So if you want to find where this is located in your content browser, you can just click this little icon like we did last time. And you see this material function MF underscore and then wipe. And you can see what's going on here. And the reason why we'd create a function is that we can use this then more globally across the project. So you can make it once, output whatever information you're trying to output, and then you can call it within the material wipe. Then if you wanted to use it in any other material setups, you wouldn't have to recreate the code. You can just call that function again. So this is a material function call. If you just right click material function call, and then you can get that. And I had it selected in my content browser, which is why it created that there. If I unselect it, so it's not selected there, and I go back into my M underscore wipe material. If I now create a function call as well, that's just going to be empty because there's no specified function there. And I actually have to go in, plug the material function in to get this functionality. So hopefully that gives you a good idea about the wipe function. One thing to note would be to offset the feather by one inset frame and set the feather and move keys to linear interpolate. So this will give you a really nice effect. You can just move these keys over and depending on how you set your key frames, you can just right click the key frame and then that'll bring up the type of curve that you want to set. So whenever you're editing frames, if you just right click them, you can set the curves. Alternatively, you'll see this little icon here, which is the curve editor. You can jump into that as well and really dial in any curves that you need to set in engine. It's also worth noting a few additional values depending on how you actually want to use this wipe effect using material functions. So the RGB channel adjusts the wipe angle and direction using both positive and negative values. So depending on how you want this wipe to operate, whether it's left to right, right to left in a diagonal direction, however you'd like to edit this, here are some useful values for you when using inside of your own projects.",
