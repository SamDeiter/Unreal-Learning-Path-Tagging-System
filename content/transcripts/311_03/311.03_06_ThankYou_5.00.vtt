00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So thank you very much for watching this video today on the foliage settings, the advanced

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.600
foliage and grass placement settings.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.240
We've talked about the tools, the types, foliage, LOD, a few tips and tricks.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.360
Hopefully it just gave you a good kind of onboarding onto your journey using foliage,

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.600
what all the different buttons are doing.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.600
And a lot of it is just playing around with the different brush sizes and densities and

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
ticking tick boxes and unticking them and just seeing what results you can get.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.480
Again, hopefully we pointed you in the right direction of some tools that can help automate

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.760
your life a little bit, you know, rather than having to go through and place individual

10
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
bushes and rocks.

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.560
Hopefully it gave you some good indication about what you might be able to apply to your

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560
projects.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.800
So thank you again for watching and we'll see you in the next video.
