00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
And then lastly, let's go over some tips and tricks that you might be able to apply to

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.080
your foliage in the project. So we can restrict foliage placement. So we can do a number of

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.320
things to restrict the placement of foliage. In the advanced section here, which you can

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.520
see highlighted, you can define the landscape layers and this foliage should be allowed

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.180
on or not. So do you want to just place the foliage on specific layers, either add them

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.340
to the inclusion layers or the exclusion layers and this will give you much more control of

7
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.340
where you are placing the foliage. You can also adjust the ground slope angle to restrict

8
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.820
the slope at which the foliage will be placed. So that's always worth knowing. And then also

9
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.620
when we're looking at the landscape grass, the grass tool can be used to mask and adjust

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.380
the placement or you can just disable the setting like the placement jitter to make

11
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.140
something that looks like a field of crops. So, I mean, you can get some really, really nice results

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.460
by actually using these tools to create something a bit more uniform if that's something that you

13
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.100
want in your project. So when used with the foliage tools, the grass tools are really,

14
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.400
really powerful. So worth considering those as well. So to close out here, we've covered

15
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.380
foliage tools, the settings and the types, talked a little bit about LOD and hopefully giving you

16
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.420
some cool tips and tricks there at the end on your foliage settings. So let's go and close out the video.
