00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
At this point it would be useful to touch upon some LOD settings you might be able to

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.100
get access to in your foliage.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.560
So foliage does not support the use of level of detail or LOD meshes but there are a few

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.620
other restrictions.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.240
So you should ensure that your static mesh has only one entry in the elements array which

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.140
is visible under log zero.

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.580
So that's the first step, make sure your static mesh only has one entry in the elements array

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.860
under the LOD.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.480
The light and shadow maps are shared between all LOD levels so LODs need to use the same

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
unwrapping on their UVs.

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.420
So currently the entire cluster of instances change LODs simultaneously.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
So there may be support for distance based fading per instance in the future but it's

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.420
not currently supported.

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.220
So lightmap coordinate index must be set to a valid UV channel that has a unique UV unwrapping.

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.200
The static mesh editors generate UVs feature is an option here where you could just use

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.280
in the static mesh editor window you can generate unique UVs and that will allow you to access

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.240
the window from the window menu and quickly generate some unwrapping there.

18
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.400
With the lightmap resolution this must be a small enough number so that all the shadow

19
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.140
maps and for instances in a single cluster can be tiled together without exceeding the

20
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.360
maximum texture resolution which is 1496 by 1496.

21
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.440
So the shadow maps must be considered there.

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.280
Again it depends if you're using a static solution or a fully dynamic global illumination

23
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.400
system like Lumen but again you're going to have to make these trade-offs and with all

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.680
LOD settings you need to make the trade-offs depending on what project you're working on.

25
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.640
And then to make the foliage fade you just need to use a per distance fade node like

26
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.680
this image here for a material setup.

27
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.660
So hopefully that gives you some good initial LOD settings to start thinking about when

28
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.480
working with foliage in your projects.
