00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
So let's kick off with the foliage tool settings and to do that I'm going to jump inside my

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.400
editor and with my editor open I'm going to go into the foliage mode. So you can find

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
the foliage mode at the top left and we'll just go to foliage. You'll see the hotkey

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.200
is shift 3. So if you want to hit shift and 3 on your keyboard you could also do that

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.320
and you'll see that we have this new window pop up for the foliage. So we can essentially

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.480
add any static mesh for foliage type we want into this tool and all we have to do is just drag

7
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
the asset from the content browser which is down here into this foliage section. You can see this

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.400
big text here saying drop foliage here. So we'll just go into our mesh and we'll get a bush mesh

9
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.840
and we'll just drag and drop that in there and I'll give myself a bit more real estate here. And so

10
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.720
you can see that we're preparing us for foliage shaders. You can see that we've got this bush

11
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.240
selected here and you'll see now when we go into our browser you can see the painting tool. So we

12
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.600
can if we left click here you'll see that we've painted some bushes and it's interesting to know

13
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.840
if I'm just going to select mode now you'll see that we've got 41 actors and that was 41 bush

14
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.160
meshes placed on that stroke. And so since we painted that foliage we just want to go in and

15
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160
sculpt our landscape. We can just left click wherever we would like and you can also shift

16
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.560
and left click to remove foliage. So if I went back into the paint tool and I held down shift

17
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600
I could left click and that deletes some and you'll see that that number has gone down.

18
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.240
So we've got a little save icon here where you can save the foliage assets and whether it's you

19
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.080
know active or not. So if you toggle this on and off it depends whether that foliage is selected.

20
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520
So let's take a look at exactly what all these settings do. So I've loaded up a screenshot of

21
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.760
exactly what you'll see in the foliage tool as we saw in the engine there and I just wanted to go

22
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680
over some of the settings here. So we've got the selection tool and that's used to select

23
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.200
individual instances, all instances, deselect, we can lasso select. You can see all of these

24
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.720
different settings for selection inside of your foliage settings. We've also got the paint tool

25
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.600
which is used for adding and removing foliage instances from the world as you just saw.

26
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.120
We've got the reapply tool which is used to change the parameters of instances already painted in the

27
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.360
world. We've got the single tool that's used to place a single instance of the selected foliage

28
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.240
using the paintbrush. We've also got the fill tool which is used to determine the number of meshes

29
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.040
to place with the paint tool. Erase tool pretty self-explanatory but it's used to erase

30
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.160
selected foliage. We've got the remove tool which removes the selected foliage and we've got move

31
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720
which moves the foliage to a different level. You may be using less of this tool in the more

32
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.800
recent versions of Unreal Engine. It depends if you're changing levels as much with your foliage

33
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.600
but it's still useful to know that. So the paint and brush options will have different options based

34
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640
on the tool selected and the filters then allow you to select which items you want from the foliage

35
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.280
to be used on. So there's loads more settings that you'll see covered. You'll see that brush sizes,

36
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.320
density, all quite self-explanatory and it's more about just playing around with these different

37
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.600
settings to get the results that you want. We can also change the mesh as you saw when we were

38
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.800
painting the mesh. You can see that the static mesh is found here so what we can also do once

39
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.160
the objects are placed allowing you to quickly change and not having to rework it. So if you

40
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.040
wanted to update that mesh and you didn't want to go in and paint everything again you could easily

41
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.840
do that with the mesh update there. We also have the painting settings where we've got the density

42
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.200
and we've got the radius but then we've also got scaling where we could change minimax values.

43
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.240
Say you wanted some variation in your foliage size for example you could set the minimax to

44
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.400
say 0.5 and 2 and you could get varying degrees of foliage so it just didn't feel like the same

45
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.800
repeating action over and over. So the paint tools do allow you to control how many objects are placed

46
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.280
and then the radius helps just make sure things are not intersecting so that that radius setting

47
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.040
there just makes sure that you can either clump things densely together or really really space

48
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.880
them out a lot more. We've also got the placement settings where placement allows you to control

49
00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.840
how the meshes are aligned to the surface area applied to so you can offset the vertical position

50
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.440
up and down if you wanted to add some variation like you can see in this image here so

51
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.680
you can give a max angle height and a max angle and height sorry that can be then applied.

52
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.560
We've also got the instant settings here so instant settings essentially control how the foliage

53
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.600
reacts to lighting, collision and culling so you can set if you want the foliage to use a light map

54
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:36.000
or not it depends if you're using fully dynamic solutions like lumen. We can also set the distance

55
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.480
at which the foliage should stop rendering and then lastly to cover some further settings we've

56
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.440
got scalability settings here and that allows you to work the foliage with the scalability setting

57
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.000
system built into unreal so this allows the system to control the foliage settings based on

58
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.280
whatever user settings you may have set. We also have the physics so this is a physical material

59
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.880
override that allows you to apply it to the foliage so physical materials could be used for certain

60
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.360
surface parameters such as if you wanted it to be slippy ice or gravel but it also can be used to

61
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.040
detect say footstep sounds and just different parameters you want when you're walking through

62
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.360
foliage to change maybe the player's behavior. We do have the virtual texture here and that's

63
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.360
for any foliage that you wish to draw to the virtual texture and then the h-lod which do you

64
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.720
want to include them in their h-lod calculations there.
