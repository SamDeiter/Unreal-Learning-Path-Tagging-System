00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Now that we understand what some of the foliage settings do, let's dig into foliage types

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.720
and what you have access to here.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.320
So there's three main foliage types.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.420
We have the active foliage, the landscape grass type, and the static mesh foliage.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.040
So foliage types allow you to make presets that can be then used as bases for other types

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.040
of foliage.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.280
So foliage types are made from and stored inside the content browser.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.240
So you can see these little icons here.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.640
That means they have some kind of data asset that belongs in the content browser.

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.440
And then each type is for a specific interaction type.

11
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.880
So kicking off with active foliage here, the active foliage is if you want the foliage

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.000
to be interacted with.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.920
The landscape grass type is for densely populated landscape grass.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.920
And then the static mesh foliage is for any static or non-interactive foliage you would

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720
like to use.

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.480
So looking at these foliage types here, if you want to run a blueprint on your foliage,

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.080
then active foliage is what you'd need to use.

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.480
It works just like any other foliage type, but it has an input for a blueprint actor,

19
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.520
which you can see in the details panel here that can then be used to spawn from it.

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.600
So it allows you to use the same tools, but scatter, say 100 or 1000 of it, an interactive

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.520
object instead of having to hand place them individually.

22
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.440
Then if you can see from this image here, you can see an example of that working.

23
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.000
So the box in front of the use, the player will trigger an event when the user goes in

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.760
and out. So we'll go in and out of this box.

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.480
And then the boxes where the painted landscape are using the foliage tool.

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.600
Then with the landscape grass type, this grass tool is used to densely cover the landscape,

27
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.080
as we said before. So you can cover the landscape terrain with things like grass or flowers

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.160
and small rocks. And you don't need to paint the area, but instead define where the grass

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.600
should spawn based on which landscape layer is visible.

30
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.280
So you can also specify things like density and offsets to allow for a variety of different

31
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.680
looking grasses here.

32
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.480
And then to show a setup here.

33
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.760
So the grass tool allows you to add thousands of static meshes to the landscape to help

34
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.960
simulate what grass will look like.

35
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.080
So with the grass tool, you can add grass to the entire landscape or just specific landscape

36
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.080
layers, like we said. So you can also use it to control the density in the distance

37
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.200
at which the grass will render.

38
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.960
So there's some optimization settings there.

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.640
And then for this type of setup to work, you would need to add the landscape grass type,

40
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.200
which is where the static meshes are used for the grass.

41
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.520
And they're defined there.

42
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.440
You can have more than one static mesh in a single grass type.

43
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.360
So that should be noted there.

44
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.560
So if we have landscape grass type, then we'd also want landscape grass output.

45
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.840
And that is this material expression here.

46
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.200
And it's the material expression node, which essentially just tells the landscape actor

47
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.320
which layer you should have the grass placed on.

48
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280
So you can also have a number of different grass types in your material.

49
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.720
And then the mesh used does not have to be grass, as we said before, it could be any kind of

50
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080
mesh or material you want to use there.

51
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.000
So you can use it to display rocks and bushes and flowers and small trees, as we said previously.

52
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.040
And then lastly, covering the static mesh foliage type.

53
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.680
So with the foliage type, we can use static mesh foliage types with the foliage paint tool.

54
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.760
So you can just see the paint settings here.

55
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.160
So each foliage type you add can be painted using this tool.

56
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.480
So nice and straightforward.
