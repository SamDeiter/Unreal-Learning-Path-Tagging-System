  "text": " Hi, everyone. In this lesson, we're going to go ahead and take a look at the newest way to create layered materials in Unreal. So let's get started. In my slides, you'll see that I have broken down every single step that you need to take to be able to make this process work. There are three major materials that you're going to need. You're going to need a material layer. You're also going to need a material in general as a parent material to house everything. And you're also going to need a material library setup. And in that material library setup within your material, we need to create a thing called a blend material. And that blend asset is going to make it so that we can actually bring the two materials together. So let's go and jump into Unreal and feel free to follow along with the slides. And we're going to break this down so you can see exactly the steps to make it happen. So in Unreal, we can see that I have set up here a layered material system and it says the new way. I have two different version copies here that you can actually look at. And they're doing two different things. One of them is a simple two layer blend. The other one is a three layer blend. And any time you can click on these and crack them open, we're mainly going to focus on the two layer blend just for time sake. But we can also look at this one first up and see kind of what's going on under the hood. If I click on this one, let's go and click on the material here inside the details. So I double click that. Let me go and pull this one over. And we'll see that we actually have the details as well as the layer parameters. Now, we've actually added a while back the ability to be able to add the layers if you need to. And you can create an instant material layer and in here, connect the materials that maybe you've already built. You'll see a plus sign for that here. Down below, we see that we have an ice material. Took a while to populate, but I got in there. And this ice material is our layer asset. In this particular case, you'll see that ML is underneath because I've made this into a material layer. I'll show you how to do that in just a bit. And down below, we have several different areas from which everything is pop everything is populated. We'll see under our subsurface area, which is built within the ice. We have a subsurface amount and a subsurface color, which is exposed. But in there, we also have an MLB, which is a material layer blend. This material layer blend allows these other materials, such as this one on the top and this one on the bottom, to all actually blend together. And you'll see there is one more here at the bottom also. So these allow us to be able to actually have three different layers of materials in here. And really, the key is these material layer blends. If they're in place, they're going to allow everything to come together. Now we're going to do this a more in a simpler aspect or a simple way. We're going to go ahead and tackle this with a more simple here. I'm clicking on the one from behind back here. And this one, if we get to our layer properties, we're going to be building the material in this particular case. Now, I made a couple in here in the default that have populated and they're not actually going to do anything. So we can actually get rid of them or you can keep them if you want to and throw some stuff in there later. But we're going to first build our material layers one into and then we're going to make a single material layer blend. And they're going to cause these guys to actually blend together. So how it's going to look if we went in here and played with it and I'll keep this material instance open, you can actually see I have an area underneath our scale of parameter values. I haven't grouped this one, but you get the idea of grouping. We can go in here and I can contrast it, pull up the contrast and you'll see the details of the damage come through. If I go to intensity, I can see that I can actually completely get rid of it and make the tile come through from the bottom. This is really convenient and helpful. And that's pretty much what we're going to build. So let's go and jump right in and do so. All right. So let's go ahead and build our first material. Somebody go to the class folder here and I'm going to create a folder called demo. You can see I have one already made, but feel free to just right click, create a new folder. That's just to keep things up up and running here. And we're going to make a new one called M.L. underscore new tile and then M.L.s for material layer. Now, if you're not sure how to get there, you simply right click in here, go to materials and you should know this by now to get to the erroneous stuff. But I'll point it to you because, you know, some things sometimes you can forget. So under materials, you go down here and you go to layer material. We're going to make two of these. So let's go and make another one. So I'm going to go to M.L. underscore. This one's going to be the new grunge. There we go. And then we need to make a material blend so we can actually get that done ahead of time. So we'll just go in here, go to materials and we're going to go to a material layer blend. Now I'm going to click on this and we do have a few that are already built in. You'll see them material layer is ready to go. So you could use those if you wanted to. We're going to make our own in this particular case so you can get an idea on how this works. So we'll do M.L.B. from material layer blend and we'll call this a demo or we'll just say new demo. There we go. And then finally, we need a parent material where we're going to house all of this and I'll show you how to build it. Now, this is going to be broken up probably in several videos. We don't want this to run too long, but I want to get the foundation ready for you so you can actually get the foundation ready for you. So you can actually jump back to it when you need to. So we're going to go to materials here or just simply go to material. You can also go here at the top. This is going to be our parent material. So we'll say M underscore demo parent. Here you go. You can call it whatever you want, whatever works for you. Let's go and double click on the tile first. Pop that up. It's off screen. So let me pull that over. And let me open this up so you can actually see what's going on here. And keep that preview going. That's totally fine to be able to do so. So don't think that you have to actually mess with that. But you know, you can leave it that way. You can kind of see your texture unfolding as you're working. So what we're going to need here is a make material attributes. And that's going to plug into this guy here who looks and kind of acts like a function input. And we've talked about that in other classes. Let's go full screen here and move this back. I'm going to leave my stats open. But if there's any errors, it will pop up automatically. If you need more real estate, feel free to close that. That's totally fine. I just did anyway. So that's fine. We'll just leave that closed. It will let us know if we plug things in correctly. So let's go and create a make material attributes. So do you make material attributes? So this is going to give us a foundation so we actually can customize this material any way that we want. Actually, I can override and allows us to, you know, build anything that we need. So I'm going to pull this execution string into my preview here for my material. In here, I'm going to go ahead and create or call up my tiles. Somebody go ahead and hit the T key, left click and T. So let's do that. T left click. And there you go. And we're going to go ahead and call up the texture that we need in this particular case. This texture that we're choosing is going to be a reflection tiles. So let's go and do T underscore reflection tiles. There we go. And we'll hit the T key again. We're going to need the normals. And you can actually punch in whatever you want. Hey, it's subsurface. In the case of the ice, we had a subsurface texture we can use. And we'll do again, reflection. And we want to do underscore. There's the broken down normals. Cool. Got that set up. And we, in this particular case, we can go straight into the normals. Now, if you wanted to, you can elaborate this a little bit more. We can go ahead and that's always good to do convert to parameter because then it's going to show up. Normals tiles. It's going to show up in our instance when we make it. And we'll put that in here and we can keep it simple. We'll just do multiply. We won't do a flat normal and a minus one minus in that particular case. We really don't need to invert this. It's pretty straightforward. So I'm going to keep my finger on the S key and we'll just say normal strength. Can't spell today. There we go. Normal strength. And we'll keep that as one. We're going to lock that down. So let's keep this down to a maximum of five. We can put it in a group if we want to. So we can just type in normal and you should know this by now. How to do some. We can do the same thing with this guy here with him exposed. We can set him to normal. Also here we got the albedo so we can control the intensity of that if we want to. So just hit the multiply again. And left click and we're going to go ahead and hit the three constants. Now in my sample it has a four constant. You're going to get an error but I won't tell you what the error is which is kind of annoying. So you know at one point it did work. He's a four constant in our particular case. We don't need that extra alpha information so we can keep it a three constant. So I'm going to right click here and say convert to a parameter and we'll call this albedo tent. There we go. And we'll set that to a white because that works better with multiplying. If it's add we can adjust that to a darker tone. Put that in the B channel. Put this in the A channel and then we'll drag this into the base color. Grab the normal put into the A channel. Put the scalar into the B channel and grab that input into the normal. And there we go. We have this initial one set up. Cool. So in the next video we're going to go and build the other material layer and we're going to go ahead and elaborate on what we have. And then we're going to bring these all together with a material layer blend. Thanks again.",
