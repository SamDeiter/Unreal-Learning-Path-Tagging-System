  "text": " To get started, we want to create a new project using the automotive template. We're going to be doing the following. So we'll make sure the Unreal Engine 5 is installed. Again, it doesn't necessarily matter if there's a new version of Unreal. It doesn't need to be 5.00. I mean, just to follow along, that might be useful, but future versions of the Unreal Engine will also be OK, just as long as it's Unreal Engine 5 and not 4. And then we want to click Launch on the Epic launcher. You can see on the top here, you just want to make sure you're in the Library tab. I'll go through this demonstration in a second, but if you just want to skip ahead, you want to set the Library tab. You can go to the Launch button. And then when this dialog window opens up, you want to select the automotive sidebar here and then we'll also select a blank template. When you set the output directory, just make sure if you have an SSD installed, it's always better to put your project on an SSD. So when you select the project location, that's preferable. And then just give your project name something that you'll recognise or remember instead of it just defaulting to my project. And just make sure you keep the file path short. Unreal starts to run into some issues if you have really long file names and it just doesn't like that too much. So just keep things concise and then just select Create and then the project should open automatically. As you open the Epic Games launcher, you'll see a window that's relatively similar to this. You can go to either the Library tab here or you can also go to the top, Unreal Engine and we just want to hit Launch, just making sure you're using some version of Unreal Engine 5. Then we'll be waiting for the editor to open. It may take a couple of seconds and it will be asking us for a template dialog box in a second. And then we'll see this screen here. So you'll see recent projects, you'll see games, film, architecture and we'll go to Automotive here along the bottom of the sidebar. We'll select blank for this purpose today. We've got the project location, I'm fine with it in my D drive in the projects and I'm just going to call this Automotive template. And then you just call your project whatever you would like, just making sure that project name isn't too long. And then we'll hit Create and then as it creates a project, Unreal Engine will create all the relevant information that it needs and then open up. And in the next video, we'll talk about continuing this project.",
