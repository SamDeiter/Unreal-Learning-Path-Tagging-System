  "text": " Now onto another new addition to UE5, the state tree. So what is a state tree? In short, they're a general purpose hierarchical state machine. They combine the selectors from behavior trees with states and transitions that you would usually see in state machine architectures. States are arranged in a tree structure and these states contain evaluators, tasks and transitions which we're all going to discuss shortly. A selection of states can be triggered at any location on the tree but it initially starts from the root of the tree. In order to create a state tree asset however, you must first select a schema for your state tree and current schemas are available. The first one being the mass state tree and the last one being the state tree component. Let's take a look at the anatomy of a state tree. First of all in figure one we have the root and this is the first state selected when the state tree is running. Next in figure two we have the selector state and this refers to a state that has child states. This state will never be selected directly and selection will continue to one of its child states. In figure three we can see the state enter condition and this refers to the list of conditions that determine when a state can be selected. In figure four we have a task and this refers to a set of actions that belonged to a state and are executed when the state becomes active. Lastly we have transition and this defines the condition that triggers the state selection process. A transition is triggered when a task completes, succeeds or fails or when a monitored condition succeeds. A state contains a list of conditions which must be met in order to consider the state for activation. During the selection process each state's conditions are evaluated. If they pass then the selection process proceeds to the state's child states if there are any. If there are no child states then the state itself will be activated. Each state consists of evaluators, tasks and transitions. The data in the state tree flows from root to its leaves. This means the data exposed by any state will be available for the other states down the tree. It's important to note that when a state is selected it will activate all of the states from the root to the leaf state. All tasks are executed for all active states starting from the root down to the selected state. A state can contain multiple tasks that are all run concurrently for as long as the state remains active. A task in a state tree is similar in concept to tasks in a behaviour tree. A task is an action that is executed when its owning state is activated. It provides an output to the state tree. Some common examples would be the selection of a target or the playing of an animation. All tasks inside a state will run concurrently. Once the first completes it will trigger a transition which can result in the selection of a new state entirely. Global tasks provide a way to run regular tasks that are associated with the tree rather than a specific state. These tasks can contain variables and execute custom code when the tree starts, ends and ticks. Gathered data can be used during state selection and will be available, as the name suggests, globally throughout the state tree. For example we could have a global task that determines the current time of day. Since the global tasks are started before the root state in the tree this information would be available when the tree starts and during the first state selection. If this state tree was controlling an AI the state selection could result in different behaviour during the night versus the day. A transition is pretty self explanatory. It can point to another state in the tree which will trigger a state selection process once again. A transition can contain trigger conditions that need to be met before the transition can occur. Transitions are evaluated starting with the leaf state and progressing upwards towards the root. During this process the first transition that succeeds and leads to a state selection will be selected. This hierarchy allows for grouping of common transitions. Completion transitions however now trigger at the state where the task that is completed is located. For example if the execution is currently at root guard leaf and the task at guard state completes, transitions on guard and root are handled skipping leaf. It's important to note that tick and event triggered transitions will have a precedence over completion",
