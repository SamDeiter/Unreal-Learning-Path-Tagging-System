  "text": " Okay, so first things first, let's take a look at some lighting terminology and what types of lights we have available in Unreal Engine 5. The topics that we're going to cover in this are going to be lighting definitions and types, what the difference is between static lighting versus dynamic lighting, as well as what light types are available for us. So, when we go to talk about lighting definitions and certain terminologies that we'll be using, and you'll hear me use this a lot as I go through this course, Direct lighting is the light that falls onto a surface without any interference, so essentially from the point that the light has been emitted directly onto the object. Then we have indirect lighting or bounce lighting. So that's lighting that's been reflected by another surface that's nearby and bounces off that surface onto the object that you're looking at, carrying some of the color information from the surface that it's bouncing off. And then we have the shadows, which happens essentially when a real engine takes a snapshot of a mesh from a lighting's point of view and projects that shadow onto the opposite side of the actor. So again, you'll hear me use the terms direct lighting and indirect lighting quite a lot, so just keep in mind what these both mean and understand how they differ. When we talk about static versus dynamic lighting, we have a few options inside of Unreal. So Lumen is the new Unreal Engine 5 fully dynamic global illumination system. It renders the fused into reflection with infinite bounces, and indirect specular reflections in large detailed environments, and really, really small to large setups. Then we also have baked or static lighting, which is pre-computed lighting, similar to what you'd see with other rendering engines such as V-Ray, Corona, and so on. It creates high quality indirect lighting and has no performance cost essentially on real time, because everything's pre-computed and stored in textures. And then we have real-time dynamic lighting, which is lighting that's updated on each frame. It's fully dynamic and can be moved around and modified at runtime. It has no global illumination, so there's only direct lighting, so no indirect lighting whatsoever, unlike Lumen. But it's also very expensive to use, and it does affect real-time performance. Unreal Engine can use a hybrid between both static and dynamic lighting, so that's something to keep in mind. We have also ray-traced lighting. This type of lighting is real-time global illumination, updated with all lights set to movable. It's important to note that some aspects of real-time lighting are not always fully dynamic, and some aspects of ray tracing are taken into account with Lumen, such as reflections and shadowing when needed. But the important thing is the difference between Lumen and just ray-traced lighting, is that ray-trace essentially is hardware ray tracing, which means that you need a graphics card able to support it, whereas Lumen doesn't necessarily need that. It's software ray traced, so it does not actually need a card, for example, like an RTX Nvidia card, to do its global illumination calculations. Now, the light types that we're going to see, and I'm running through this as I go here, but we'll be doing an exercise later on so you can actually see each light and how they all differ. But we have directional light, like a sun, a point light, a spotlight, rectangular light, a skylight, and then a couple of extra light setups here, which are called the HDRI backdrop and sun and sky, which are essentially a couple of blueprints that are set up for HDR lighting in the case of HDRI backdrops. And sun and sky allows you to essentially have a very accurate sun position in for a particular latitude and longitude in a specific place. So really nice couple of blueprints that you can use there specifically if you need them, that sort of thing for your project. Now, when it comes to the properties and settings of the lights, we're going to cover the light properties and the mobility options for each light. So when it comes to the properties and settings that we can change for point lights and spotlights, we are looking at candelas, lumens, or unitless setups for the intensity. Now, importantly, 100 watts on a light bulb would equal 100 lumens. However, the directional light, which is more like a sun, is calculated in lux values. In each one of the lights, all these things are going to be common. So we're going to have the intensity, indirect lighting intensity, so how much they contribute to that indirect bounce lighting, the attenuation, which is how far from the emission point of the light, the light actually travels. We can use temperature if we want to, to change the color without having to actually change the color and use a temperature value. Source radius and source angle. Source angles you'll see on the directional light and source radius you'll see on every other type of light, which will allow you to change the softness of the radius as well as the size of the specular reflection on the surfaces. Whether to use inverse squared falloff for lighting, and this is something I recommend to just use for everything since it's a more realistic approach to set up lighting. And then we also have IES profiles if we want to actually change the way that light is distributed based on a particular real life profile. When it comes to light mobility, we have static, which essentially means this light is going to be baked indirect and direct lighting. It's the cheapest to use once again as it gets stored into textures and does not have an impact in performance at real time. We've got stationary, which is baked indirect lighting. It's high quality direct lighting and shadows that are on the fly. Essentially, that's the dynamic side of it, but it has a limited use. You can only have a maximum of four overlapping lights, but it's the highest quality to medium performance if you're using a static lighting sort of set. And then we have movable, which is fully dynamic lights and shadows. If you're using lumen, you will get indirect lighting out of this. If you're not, you will only get direct lighting, as I mentioned earlier. It has the highest performance cost. And again, if you're not using lumen, you won't get indirect lighting. But again, if you're using lumen, you will. So that's really it. After this, we're just going to get into actually taking a look at lumen as the premier Unreal Engine 5 lighting system. So let's go ahead and do that. So let's go ahead and do that.",
