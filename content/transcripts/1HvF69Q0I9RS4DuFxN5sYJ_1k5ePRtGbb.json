  "text": " The next tool we'll create is something to do with a utility widget and we'll create some kind of camera functionality inside of our levels to show you exactly how utility widgets might work. So to find the utility widgets, again you can right click in your content browser, this time go to editor utilities and we want the editor utility widget. And the level setup here is just going to be a basic starter map from that starter content and we'll just drag and drop a few cameras into the level so we can switch between the cameras using this utility widget. By default you'll see this UMG style setup in the utility widget and we just want to create a little widget based on the functionality that we want. So I'm just going to resize this canvas panel, it doesn't need to be a specific size, you can see the different aspects that we're working with here but I'll just use something a little bit smaller here and then we want to make sure we have our canvas panel here and then we'll add a vertical box. So we'll add a vertical box into here, we'll just move this into position somewhere around here, doesn't really matter too much where, again we're looking at the functionality today. We want some kind of button so I'll drag and drop the button in as well and we'll rename this button the next camera button. So next camera button and then we'll get some text for the button maybe and drag and drop that into the text box and we'll just call this maybe next camera. There we go. So we'll have some kind of button here, again you can change the style and you can change all the height, we're mainly looking at the functionality today so the great thing about utility widgets is then you can add your own design and customisation onto these tools for your own project settings. So I'm just going to compile and save that and then we need to move into the level scripting, well the editor scripting sorry. So we want to make sure we get some kind of event from our button click, so we want to first of all get the on clicked of our variable here, so we want to go into our variable, select the next camera button and then you'll see on clicked here. So we'll just click on click and therefore we've got an event that's bound specifically to that box that we're clicking. We'll do a get all actors of class, so we've got that and then we want the cine camera actor as our class because in our level we'll have placed multiple cine cameras and therefore we'll find all the cine cameras that are in our level and we're going to output some kind of information. So we want to get the self here as the world context object because the utility is getting all the actors of class, so you just want to drag out there and click self and then we want to add all of these cameras to an array. So we'll drag out from our actors, we'll promote this to a variable and we'll say list of cameras. So we've got a list of cameras there and so now we want to figure out how to cycle through each of these cameras. So we'll first of all do, we actually want to find our current camera first and so we can iterate through the series of cameras. So let's have a new variable here and let's call that current camera so we know which camera we're currently looking at and that will want to be an integer. So we'll make sure we change this to an integer and then we'll drag this out holding down control drag this into our panel here and then we want to get one of our cameras from the list of cameras. So we'll get a copy of this and then plug our integer into here so we're going to get whatever current camera index we have from this list of cameras. Then we want to get the editor actor subsystem which is something that's built inside of Unreal Engine and then what we will do is we will use a function called set actor selection state which essentially uses a target which is this actor subsystem and we'll use the get from the current camera to set the correct selection. So we'll drag off here and we'll do set actor selection state or maybe we'd have to drag off here let's check set actor selection state yeah so just drag off the editor actor subsystem we'll plug this in here and then the actor will be the one that we got from the camera so that can just plug straight into there. So that will essentially select the right camera now what we want to do is make sure that we actually can cycle through the different cameras so to do that we'll use this integer that we created and make sure we can cycle through this array of cameras. So let's first of all get the current camera again so we'll get the integer from here to cycle through the camera we'll get the current integer and just add one to the camera so it gets the next one in the series of cameras. We'll find our list of cameras so we'll drag out our array here and we want to get the length of the list of cameras so we essentially want to know how many cameras can we cycle through into this series of cameras so then we can just hit the percentage button on our keyboard here to get the integer here and we'll drag into them like that and then since we've got our current camera we've indexed by one so now we're moving to the next camera the next thing we want to do is actually set this integer that is ready for this next set of actor selection states so we want to then get that current camera so this basically rounds off the system by just plugging that into there and you can essentially just say that this property here is the cycling camera so if I just press C on my keyboard and I comment this saying this is the cycle camera section that's what's doing that functionality there. So essentially that's looking pretty good we've got our first bit of set up here and I think the main thing now we want to do is actually select the camera based on all of this information so let's actually let's add a section at the end here and to actually select the camera so we can copy and paste a lot of what we're doing here by saying just copy so I'm just going to control C I'm going to highlight everything control C because this should be selected button is false we actually want to now select it so we can paste here we can get that we can drag this into here we'll just comment this section that says select camera so you know exactly what's going on there and then instead this box should The only thing that we want to do now is drag out the array that we had before and just make sure that's plugged in there and that should be pretty much all the functionality so moving from the first bit of setup you've got just getting all the actors and making sure that we have we know what the current camera is and we're not now saying that this should be selected by default we want to then cycle the camera but then make sure that that bull is then ticked on the out of that functionality so that's everything in order there and so you can essentially just try and use this in the scene now so if I compile and save and I'm going to go into my map I'll add a few cine cameras into my level so let's say we've got make sure things are in focus here so I'm just going to hold down alt add a few different cameras just to make sure we have plenty of variation so we can see exactly what's going on so there we go and so what we want to do now is our camera utility the widget that we've created we can just right click that in our content browser and we can go to run editor utility widget and you'll see that the dimensions here are the things that we created before you can actually pin these utility widgets as well making sure obviously you're in the sizing correct if you are going to pin them and use them in specific aspect ratios but if I just click this I can just get the next camera and I'm cycling through each of the cameras so really really nice straightforward tool to create again once you set that utility up you can use that on multiple different projects and that will just cycle through all the different cameras in your scene so you can see exactly what's going on again you could spend hours on the detailing of the widgets really dial them into your specific preferences but hopefully that basic setup was useful to you and you know how to use utility widgets now and now we'll move on to some more advanced functionality using utility widgets when we're talking about ray tracing settings",
