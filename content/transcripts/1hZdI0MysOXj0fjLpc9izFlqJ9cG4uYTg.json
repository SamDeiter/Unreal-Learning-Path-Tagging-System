  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look at the outline for the series of courses. And then we're also going to take a look on what ray tracing is and how it works in Unreal. So let's get started. So first up, we'll take a quick look at ray tracing, what it is, look at its costs and how to set it up. From there, we'll look at aspects of creating better quality editing your materials, as well as later on, we'll look at lighting and properties, things to look out for when it comes to your lights. The post process control reflection quality, and we'll also look at editing and troubleshooting. And in there, we'll look at combining quality performance and optimizing overall. Later on, we'll move on to path tracer, look at what it is and how to use it, setting it up, and some of the issues that may occur and some of the solutions we have when it comes to depth of field materials and reducing artifacts. Next, we'll look at setting up materials, editing materials, looking at skylight aspects, pro tips, limitations, and some plugins that may help you on your journey. So let's go and get started. So ray tracing overall is a very unique and awesome way to be able to light your scenes. Now, there are several ways to light your scenes, such as lumen, path tracer, and even baked lighting. But we're going to focus mainly on ray tracing here. I'm going to point out some tips and tricks if you decide to use this for your projects. So one, we're going to talk about what exactly is it. Now, the old way we used to have for rendering was rasterization. And it was typically used with objects in the scene that are created by virtual mesh of triangles, hence the baking method. So that's our old way to be able to render things out. Now, with lumen, as well as ray tracing, you're actually being able to have your lights movable and in real time update, particularly in ray tracing, we're going to be getting photons bouncing back and forth. So it relies on a system of bounce photons from object to object before reaching the camera to produce an image. And lumen borrows some of the technology to be able to make it happen. But it is a bit more optimized for quicker updates. So the cost with ray tracing, hardware ray tracing uses a two level bounding volume hierarchy, and you'll see its acronym here called BVH to accelerate ray transversal. The top level acceleration structure TLAS contains all mesh instances for the whole scene. And the meshes referenced by those instances are bottom level acceleration structures or BLAS. So I know a lot of acronyms, but they prevent us from having to repeat and type this all out. So you'll hear these once in a while as I'll mention them, but you'll see in the tlas that the top level acceleration structure is actually a top level acceleration structure. But you'll see in the table, they're actually spelled out to make things a little bit easier. When you look at this diagram here, you can actually see the reasoning behind ray tracing. If you're unfamiliar with it, that some people have said that you when working with ray tracing, it is more expensive to have an interior versus an exterior. And that is true. And it's based on these principles because the photons in a small enclosed area are bouncing back faster to the camera than they would if it was an open area. We'll repeat this later. And I'll remind you about this. But it's something to keep in mind when building your ray tracing that the interiors or enclosed areas are more expensive than the exteriors. So there are three main categories for costs associated with ray tracing. So one building the bottom level acceleration structures for dynamically deforming meshes like skin meshes and hair. Building the top level acceleration structures for the scene and the shader binding table and ray transversal for each feature that uses ray tracing. So for development of your project, you can test the ray tracing cost of specific types of geometry with console variables. One thing I do want to mention and I'll repeat later is when you have particular geometry that is very small and has very small pieces in it, such as trees or other items, those can get kind of expensive. So you have to be very strategic when using them because all of those cards, all of those pieces that are reacting to light and those photons are bouncing back to the camera. But again, you can use this C-var r.raytracing.geometry in your C-vars to be able to test the cost and see how things are being related. So you see here overall cost. These are the C-vars to be able to check such things as static meshes, skeletal meshes, instant meshes, landscape terrain, geometry catch, as well as geometry collection, Niagara meshes, Niagara ribbons, Niagara sprites, and procedural meshes. So let's go into Unreal and talk about setting this up. I have put a step by step here in our slides and our notes, which you should be able to see. So that's what you should have access to. But I'm going to walk you through it here and some tips and tricks to keep things in mind, even when you grab stuff from the marketplace. So the scene I'm initially using, I want to make sure that I'm set into lit mode. If for some reason you open it, it's in path tracer, just set it to lit mode. We'll talk about path tracer later. So right now in lit mode, let me show you how to set things up on a generic level. So in my project settings, as we talked about in the past, if we go into rendering, we can control what our output is going to be. In our particular case, we want to set everything to ray tracing and it says deprecate. Don't let the deprecation tag here fool you. It will be around for a while. Some of our clients, particularly automotive, still use this type of global illumination quite often and reflection method. So you'll notice reflection capture resolution. I'm sending that at 2048 and that should be great because you can use it as a fallback method when working with ray tracing. You'll notice the shadow maps aren't really going to matter in this case, because since we're in ray trace mode and our lights are movable, it's going to update our shadows and light and light on the fly. So overall, we should be good to go. But there are a few things to keep in mind. There's a thing called G buffer you want to look at, and you want to make sure that's set to high precision normals. By default in a real because it's using lumen, this should already be on. But if you're grabbing stuff from the marketplace, this is something you need to consider. DX12 will also be available here, or we should say our RHI. And you want to set your default RHI to DX, DirectX 12. But again, this is more if you're grabbing stuff from the marketplace. Overall, we should be good to go on that note. And let's go ahead and play with a few things and go back to the slides. So in here, you can also turn on texture LOD. This is optional for optimization. I usually turn it on. Shader model 6 also you want to make sure is turned on in your project settings. It can be helpful. I'd like to turn on just for good measure. If I'm going back between ray tracing and lumen, it's good to have it on. Doesn't hurt. Make sure you turn on support compute skin catch. That is also very important. And this one I did not show in the project settings nor the compute catch. This usually gives you a prop when you turn on ray tracing, and you would turn it on as soon as you get that prompt. But down below, this one is a modeling mode. Enable ray tracing while editing. This is kind of important, especially if you're using the new modeling tools. You kind of want to turn this on because you may run into some crashes because Unreal sees that you're changing the geometry, but may not understand your intention and what you're doing. So you might not understand your intention and might calculate that, miscalculate it, the photons bouncing back to the camera, and could be an issue. I'm pretty sure that we fixed this already, but I think it's a good measure to turn that on anyway. That's it for this lesson. In the next lesson, we're going to take a look at editing your materials for ray tracing and some of the things you can do and tips and tricks to look out for when working with materials with ray tracing.
