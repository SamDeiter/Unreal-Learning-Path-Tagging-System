  "text": " Right, now we're going to do a little bit more work setting up this behavior tree. So I'm going to delete everything that I've created now. So I've got a nice clean starting point. And I'm going to jump over to our blackboard. Let's set up our different keys that we're going to need. So you can see here on the top here, we have a new key. I'm going to do a drop down. And the first one I'm going to search for is the vector. OK, that gives us a yellow key. Now I'm going to name this location. OK, so this is just going to be a X, Y, and Z float. We're going to use to denote a location in space. OK, and one more that we're going to add in. And that is going to be a object. And the object key we're going to type in. And we're going to call this player. Now, the object itself is we're going to want to reduce the base class. The reason is an object doesn't necessarily have a location in space. We're going to have trouble placing stuff into it. So what I'm going to do is you can see that we have a base class here. I'm going to select that. I'm going to change that to actor. So that means we're not going to need to do a cast to get things like location. So we're only going to be able to save references to things which have a parent class somewhere of actor. OK, with that, I'm going to save and jump back into our behavior tree. So let's set up our first state. So I'm going to drag off of the root and I'm going to select a selector. So this is going to be our first state. Then I'm going to drag off and I'm going to select a sequence. And this sequence I am going to rename Wonder Rent. I put a space in there as well. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to just get these characters to wander around. And this will be the default activity because it's on the left hand side here. Now, at the moment, it's all right that we've got our sort of flow nodes in here, but we're not actually asking it to do anything at all. So what we're going to do in order to do that is we're going to get it to do something. We need to add in tasks. Now, there are actually a whole load of remade tasks here, but we're going to create one from scratch. So if we come up to the top here, you can see we have an option for new task. I'm going to do a drop down. I'm going to select BT task underscore blueprint base. And I'm going to create a task. I'm going to call it BT underscore find random location. Okay, so this is going to be a task where we're going to find a random location. We start off with the wonder about your own to find a random location and wander to it. So once you've created your task, you're going to get a screen that looks like this. So we've got the blueprint functionality element here, but we have no viewport. That's because a task has no components, has no visible aspects to it. It's just a function. We're just going to be telling it, sending it some instructions to do something. Okay, so one thing you might also have noticed is we have no red settings. And that's because we need to start by overriding one of the base functions. So you can see here we have functions and there is six overrideable. And we do a drop down. We have a number of options. You can see we have receive abort. So any code that is connected to this will be triggered if the task is abort. I'm not going to worry too much about that. Receive execute. Now, this is what we are going to use because this is the when the task is first run. Any of the code that is connected to that is going to be run from the receive execute. Finally, we have receive tip. Now, what receive tick will do is this will any of the functions that are connected to this will run every frame whilst the task is running. Now, you'll also notice that we've got other options here. So we've got the receive abort AI. We've got an equivalent with AI. Let me show you all the difference is here. I go receive execute and receive execute AI. They're very similar except for we have some different input pins. So for the receive execute AI, we are guessing the owner controller and the controlled porn where from the receive execute, we're guessing an actor. So it's just what output is going to be executed. Now, we are just going to use for this example, we're going to use the receive execute because we're going to need to cast anyway. So I'm going to delete the event receive execute AI and we're going to use this one. Now we have the owned actor and all we're looking to do is get the owner controller and the controlled porn. However, I am going to want to pass out the data that we are calculating here. And that's where we are going to have to use a variable and a specific variable. So if I push plus on the variables and I am going to call this local location, and rather than a boolean, what I'm looking for is a blackboard key selector, blackboard key selector here. And I am going to add another variable. This time I'm going to use it as a function. So I'm going to use the function. So I'm going to use the function. And I am going to add another variable. This time I'm going to use it as a float. I'm going to rename this. I'm going to call this radius. And each of these I am going to make instance editable so that we can see them externally. OK, so I've created two variables. Location, which is a blackboard key selector, and a radius. Now, let's write some code. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to drag off the owned actor. And I'm going to get actor location. So in this I'm just finding out where the actor is. And I'm going to drag off of this. Get random reachable point in radius. OK, so that's the node that we want. And what this is going to do is this is going to just return a location which we will be able to walk to. Now, I'm going to drag in the radius. If I place that over the radius, I get this green tick. I drop that on. It's going to use that as an input. And that should be enough code that we've got here. Now, I'm going to do one more thing. I'm going to drag in the location and get it. And I'm going to type set blackboard value. Now, this is interesting because in order for us to pass data into the blackboard, we are going to have to use we're going to have to set a blackboard key. And in this case, we're setting a location. So we're going to set this blackboard value as a vector. Again, a vector is just three floats denoting X, Y and Z, which can which can be used to represent a location in the world. So we grabbing our vector. I'm going to plug that in and I'm going to connect up the random location. Now, that's great. So far, this code is good. What this is going to do is it's going to find out where the actor is, find the location and then save it to a blackboard variant. Now, there is one final thing that we need to do. And I want to stress this because if you are making a task and you forget to do this, you're never going to leave that task. You're never going to go back to the behavior tree and move on to the next one. And that is finish execute. So you have a finish execute here. Now, this is where we go back and tell the code if it was a success or a failure. So we can either finish execute with success ticked on. That means it's a success or unticked and it's a failure. And I'm going to connect up the output pin from the get random reachable point in radius. So that way we can succeed if we can find a location to go to. Otherwise, we're going to fail. And this is important because this is going to denote how we move through the behavior tree. OK, so that is the entire code that we need for this. I'm going to hit compile and save. Right. Now, I'm going to go back and tell the code if it was a success or a failure. Now I am going to jump back to the behavior tree and under our wonder about, I'm going to drag out and I can I am going to type in find random location. And you can see here it's at the top here. If you want to check if you've written it correctly, there's a finished version. But BT find random location. Now, if you see here by default, what we have is two default values. We have location and radius. And as you can see, that's the same as our two variables, which we have made instance editable. So our first thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to set the radius because zero is not going to to go very far. So let's change the radius to a thousand. That allows us to change how the task functions. The second thing is we are getting a location and this gives us a drop down of what blackboard actor we want to save this to. Now, the self actor is not what we want to save this to. We want to save this to location. So that has found a found a random area and it is saved it into the blackboard. The blackboard key has good location. Now, if I drag off. You can see that there are a whole made a whole load of pre made tasks. We're going to use the move to here. And as the input move to, I am going to ask this to move to the location. So again, what we've done here is we found a random location and then we told it to move to it. We're also going to drag off. And then once we've hit the location, I'm just going to ask it to wait. And five seconds is too long. So I'm just going to make it wait for one second. And I'm going to save that. Now let's test. So if I jump back into our behavior tree and I push play. You can now see that all of our NPCs are finding a random location. They're moving directly towards it. And then they are stopping for one second. Okay, so we've successfully implemented a behavior tree. And now we can make it a little bit more complicated in the next video.",
