  "text": " Authoring materials for Path Tracer involves similar fundamental processes used to create any other Unreal Engine material. However, it's crucial to be aware of a few specific parameters. Your shading model, blending mode, and lighting modes of your material all affect the final results of your scene, especially when used with Path Tracer. When using Path Tracer, be aware that it considers the size and thickness of your meshes. Therefore, consider the geometry's thickness when modeling in your DCC application. Included in the project files are three different glass materials. To open the material, you can simply click the object in your viewport, and from the details panel, navigate to and double-click on the material icon to open the material. From there, you can see how the material was constructed and better understand how path tracing is using these certain parameters of the material to produce the results in our viewport. In this next section, we're going to walk through a hands-on demonstration of creating a material from scratch.",
