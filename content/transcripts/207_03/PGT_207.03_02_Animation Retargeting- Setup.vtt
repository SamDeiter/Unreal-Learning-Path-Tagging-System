00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
All right, animation retargeting.

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.760
Let's get started.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.520
So retargeting, it allows animations to be reused between characters with the same skeleton

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.960
and they could have vastly different proportions.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.280
Now Unreal, it uses a concept called a rig, which I would have called bone mapping, and

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.680
it acts as the translator from one character to another.

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.600
The character's proportions may be different, but the skeletons need to be similar enough

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.700
to be mapped to the same bone mapping.

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.360
And what I mean by that is no inserted or missing bones in the middle of the chain.

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.800
I mean you could have a winged angel character and, you know, if the angel has a similar

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.000
skeletal structure to a human that you already have in the level, except the only difference

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.480
is it has wings, that is fine.

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.800
You would not be able to retarget motion from a biped character to say a cat that walks

14
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920
on all fours.

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.800
But you could retarget from a quadruped to another quadruped.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.660
And I also want to mention the concept of the bind pose.

17
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.760
And just for now, I want you to know that if the original pose of your character is

18
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.600
different than the one that you are retargeting to, it will affect the fidelity of the animation.

19
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.720
And there's ways to work around that, but keep that in mind when you are retargeting.

20
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.040
Okay, so I want us to go ahead and dive into Unreal.

21
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:49.440
So I'm here in the engine, and what you can do to follow along is go to File, New Project,

22
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.320
select the Games Template, hit Next, and grab the Third Person Template.

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.200
It's got some good animations for this demo.

24
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
Hit Next.

25
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.720
Find a good folder path for your project.

26
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.480
I called this project Retargeting Crowds.

27
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.880
You can call it whatever you like.

28
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.320
Hit Create Project.

29
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.640
I will close the dialog window because I already have a project.

30
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.640
And then the next thing I would like you to do is go to your Epic Games launcher and select

31
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.080
the Marketplace tab.

32
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.520
And then in the Search Products section, type in Infinity Blade.

33
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.240
Now we're looking for the Infinity Blade Warriors pack.

34
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.840
And these characters were designed specifically for the skeleton that isn't Unreal, so this

35
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.600
is perfect for a retargeting example.

36
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.840
Now I already own this pack, so you might have a different button right here.

37
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.480
Go ahead and click on that, but then you'll have the option to add to project.

38
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.120
And then it says, no compatible projects.

39
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
It's actually okay.

40
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.800
There's no blueprint functionality that would clash with code or anything like that.

41
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.040
So just select Show All Projects.

42
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680
Grab your project.

43
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.440
And I know the red letters look a little scary.

44
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440
It's okay.

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.360
Just select 4.26, Add to Project, and I promise it will actually be okay.

46
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
And we'll let that come in.

47
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.200
So I'm back in the engine.

48
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.360
I'm going to click the Show or Hide Sources panel.

49
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.600
And then on the left, you'll notice we now have an Infinity Blade Warriors folder.

50
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.360
And next up, we will talk about the Retarget Manager.
