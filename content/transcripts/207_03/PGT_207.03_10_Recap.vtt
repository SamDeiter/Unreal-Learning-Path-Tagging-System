I just want to say thank you for joining me in the Retargeting and Crowds course.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.300
So this is just a recap really quickly.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.280
We first went over how to reuse animations between different characters of similar skeletal

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.040
structure and there were two main methods that we went over.

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.940
The first was animation retargeting and then the second was skeleton retargeting.

6
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.700
After that we went over blend spaces.

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.900
So that was if you need to blend between animations in real time during gameplay.

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.340
And then after that we used our retargeted characters and set up a crowd simulation.

9
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.940
And then we used the take recorder system to record the results.

10
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.740
So hopefully by now I hope you see the power of Unreal's retargeting features and I wish

11
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.220
you all the best and I'll see you next time.
