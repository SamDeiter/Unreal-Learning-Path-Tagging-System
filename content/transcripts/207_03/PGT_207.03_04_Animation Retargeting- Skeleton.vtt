00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180
In this video, I'll go over the skeleton retargeting.

2
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.160
This way all of our animations are effectively getting retargeted at once.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.240
So I'm here in the engine, I'm going to work my way to complete characters folder.

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.440
So I'm looking at my skeletal meshes and the warrior skeleton again.

5
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.160
Now when we retargeted animations, they were automatically duplicated for us.

6
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.920
With skeleton retargeting, it's a good practice to duplicate the skeletal mesh first.

7
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.440
So that way if you goof and you mess up, you've got a backup.

8
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.840
So I'll go to the cardboard skeletal mesh, right click, duplicate, and I'm just going

9
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.400
to give it an underscore RT suffix so that I know this is the one that's been retargeted.

10
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.960
If you are retargeting with multiple characters, maybe you give a little bit more specific suffix

11
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640
so you know which one goes to which.

12
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.760
But for now, underscore RT for this example is fine.

13
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.720
So I'm going to right click on this newly created skeletal mesh and go up to skeleton

14
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.540
and there's this assign skeleton option.

15
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.960
So I'm going to click on that.

16
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.300
And there's an extra skeleton that came with this pack.

17
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.680
It's called Barbarous.

18
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.040
We haven't done any retargeting on it.

19
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.920
That's why we see all of the angry red letters.

20
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.680
If I were to accidentally click on warrior skeleton, it would not be the end of the world.

21
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.600
Effectively nothing would happen because that's what it's set to right now.

22
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
And then UE4 mannequin skeleton, that's the one that we want.

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.260
And we can see that all the bones are matching up.

24
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.840
So that's great.

25
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.400
I'll hit accept.

26
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
And then okay, it looks like something happened.

27
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200
We just need to make a save.

28
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.720
So let me control shift S.

29
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.820
And now the asset is saved.

30
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.960
But did anything happen?

31
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.240
I can't really tell yet.

32
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.160
So let me click on the third person character.

33
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.880
And then I have this retargeted card word character selected in the content browser.

34
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.400
And then if I click on this left arrow so that I can use the currently selected asset

35
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
instead, I'll hot swap the two.

36
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.680
So I'll just click on the left arrow.

37
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.360
And now we have the cardboard man right here.

38
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.960
So if I hit play, all of the animations that came with Manny are now accessible for the

39
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.840
cardboard.

40
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.960
So here we go.

41
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.280
He's jumping around, running around doing all the same things that Manny was doing.

42
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.520
So I will hit escape.

43
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.400
And let's do this a couple more times.

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.920
So let me duplicate the golden character.

45
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.000
I'll do control W, give him a suffix to let me know that it's the retargeted version.

46
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.640
And then right click, skeleton, assign skeleton, grab Manny, hit accept.

47
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:47.200
And then we'll do that for shell, control W, underscore RT, right click, skeleton, assign

48
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.040
skeleton, grab the mannequin and hit accept.

49
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.480
And I'll say that's good for now.

50
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.000
So control shift S. And so now I could swap the mannequin character for the shell character

51
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
now.

52
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.600
So if I hit the left arrow while having the shell character selected and I hit play, okay,

53
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440
we've got yet another character.

54
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440
Great.

55
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440
Escape.

56
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440
Okay.

57
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:27.000
And then one more time with the golden character, hit the left arrow and there's our character

58
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.760
number three.

59
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.920
Now let's say I accidentally grabbed the wrong one.

60
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.640
Maybe I didn't grab golden RT, but I grabbed the original one and then I swapped that asset.

61
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.800
Uh oh, the character is in an A pose.

62
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.440
It's just in this default position and it's just sliding around.

63
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.080
Oops, I did something wrong.

64
00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.360
And even if I try to switch it back to, oh yeah, let me switch it to the cardboard RT.

65
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.080
Okay.

66
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.920
And then I hit play.

67
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.560
It's still not working.

68
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.000
Now the reason is because the animation class got confused when I grabbed a skeletal mesh

69
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.640
that was not retargeted.

70
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.520
So if that ever happens to you, all you have to do is switch it back to third person anim

71
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.560
BP.

72
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.640
And then if I hit play, okay, we're back in business.

73
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.760
Now this slide, it's just a summary of the different types of retargeting that we've

74
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760
been doing.

75
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.440
So in the last video, the first thing we did is set up the bone mapping and bone mapping.

76
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.400
That is a mandatory step.

77
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.360
The bone mapping is what translates one skeleton to another.

78
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.320
Next we edited the translation retargeting to ensure the body proportions match the current

79
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.920
skeleton.

80
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.280
And then lastly, we briefly talked about bind poses and that is a step that's helpful if

81
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.000
your characters have different default poses.

82
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.160
Like one is in a pose and the other is in T pose.

83
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.760
After that, you can retarget the animation, the skeleton, or even the animation blueprints,

84
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.240
but that's a topic for another day.

85
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.960
And then one more side note, let's say you are retargeting animations from one source

86
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.280
and then later you want to retarget a different set of animations that require a different

87
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.920
setup.

88
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.320
Any new changes that you make won't affect any previously retargeted animations.

89
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.120
So new changes will only affect the subsequent animations you retarget.

90
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.840
So that's animation retargeting.

91
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.640
In the next video we're going to talk about blend spaces.
