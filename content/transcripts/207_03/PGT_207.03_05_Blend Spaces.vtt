00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
Blend Spaces are assets that allow you to blend animations based on one or more values

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.040
like speed or direction, for example.

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.400
And Blend Spaces, they're more of a game design concept and were designed to reduce

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.400
the amount of animation assets necessary for the unpredictability of dynamic gameplay.

5
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.040
So again, Blend Spaces, they use one or more float values to determine how much influence

6
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.800
an animation has in the final blended motion.

7
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.000
And I'm just going to rebuild the current default Blend Space behavior that's in the engine.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.120
So if I hit play, I've got my cardboard man and as I drive around, he transitions from

9
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.420
the idle to the running animation based on the speed.

10
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.460
So let's create a new Blend Space.

11
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.700
You can make a one dimensional Blend Space or a two dimensional Blend Space, which is the default.

12
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.820
And you can make a Blend Space from a skeletal mesh or a skeleton, actually.

13
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.580
I could right click on our cardboard retargeted man and I could go to create Blend Space 1D.

14
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
Or if you can't remember which skeleton the skeletal mesh is using, you could go to

15
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.420
skeleton, find skeleton, and then it zips us to our mannequin skeleton.

16
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.340
So since we're here, I'll just right click on the skeleton, create Blend Space 1D and

17
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.420
I'll call it BS demo idle one.

18
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.780
So I will open that up and dock the tab.

19
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.720
And we're looking at our new interface.

20
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.540
So let's drop in some animations and adjust the horizontal axis.

21
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:17.220
So if I go back to our Blend Space, let's change the name of the horizontal access to

22
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:29.180
speed and change the maximum value to 375, which is what the engine uses.

23
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.580
And I'm going to keep the number of grid divisions to four, but if you need more slots

24
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.060
for animations, feel free to increase that in the future.

25
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.180
And then there's not much to see right now, but you can preview by dragging the green diamond.

26
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.620
But to make things more interesting, if I want to add a run animation, all I have to

27
00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:00.060
do is go to the asset browser and then just click drag third person run and a diamond

28
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.260
will appear depending on which line I'm closest to with the mouse.

29
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860
So I'll just go to the far right and release.

30
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.260
And now Manny is running.

31
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.780
And if you did not see the asset browser, you can go to window and you should be able

32
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.180
to find asset browser right there.

33
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.820
And then I also want my character to idle when it's not in motion.

34
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.140
So I will drag third person idle all the way to the left and release.

35
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.500
And if you don't want to click drag the little diamond, if you hit the shift button on your

36
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.580
keyboard, you can release the mouse and all you have to do is move your mouse.

37
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.560
You don't have to click.

38
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.620
So we are idling and now we're running.

39
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.620
Ta-da!

40
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.620
Okay.

41
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.580
And then one more, let's add the walk.

42
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.380
Third person walk, I'll drag that to the line that's second from the left.

43
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.180
And if you ever decide to change the animation, all you have to do is just drag a new animation

44
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.540
on top of that diamond and then it will swap it out.

45
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.860
And if you need to reduce the number of transitions, you could just click a diamond, hit the delete

46
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.040
key on your keyboard.

47
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.820
But I want to put the walk animation back.

48
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.500
All right, let's hit save.

49
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.300
And we could also choose to make a 2D blend space.

50
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.100
And you'll notice that instead of just having a horizontal axis, there's also a vertical

51
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.320
axis.

52
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.940
So you could have both speed and direction or you don't have to be limited to those examples.

53
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.700
And the complexity, it increases as you can see.

54
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.360
And without this system, I mean, imagine having an individual animation represented for each

55
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.340
of these different combinations.

56
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.500
So it's nice that you don't have to do that.

57
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.020
That's a brief introduction to blend spaces.

58
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.940
And in the next video, we will work on the crowd simulation.
