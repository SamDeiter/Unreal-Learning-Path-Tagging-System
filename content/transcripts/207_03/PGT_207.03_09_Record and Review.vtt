1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
Now last but not least is the Take Recorder section.

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.240
So we're going to use the Take Recorder plugin to record our crowd simulation.

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.640
Now as of Engine 4.27, the Take Recorder plugin is by default enabled, but if for some reason

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.920
you're using an older version or you accidentally disabled it, you can go to Settings, Plugins,

5
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.320
type in Take Recorder, and as you can see it's already enabled for me, but you can enable it.

6
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.760
Restart, save your project, and come back you'll be good to go.

7
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.280
Now before I open up the Take Recorder plugin, I first want to take advantage of the retargeted

8
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.200
characters that we spent all this time working on earlier in this class.

9
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.840
So let's change our crowd to be not just mannequin characters, right?

10
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.000
So I'm going to go to the Infinity Blade Warriors folder, go to Character, Complete Characters,

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.040
and let me grab the golden retargeted character, and then just use the same technique with

12
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.360
the left arrow button next to the skeletal mesh details panel on the right.

13
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.120
Click that left arrow button and then the mesh hot swaps just instantaneously, and then

14
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.600
I'll click another crowd character or another crowd agent, and let's put the shell retargeted

15
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.920
character on him using the same left arrow technique.

16
00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:00.400
And maybe on this guy we'll find another cardboard character and put him on there,

17
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.320
and then in the very back let's put the golden guy on there.

18
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.440
Okay, so there is our crowd, and let's actually get the Take Recorder to show up.

19
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.400
So all you have to do is go to Window, Cinematics, Take Recorder, and then you should see the

20
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.120
Take Recorder tab open up and the Sequencer tab.

21
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.200
Now I was messing with the interface and normally by default the Take Recorder is a little bit

22
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:42.240
bigger, but I made my level viewport window larger so that I could see my play button,

23
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.320
which is going to be important because you have to hit play before you can record.

24
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.240
I mean the record button is kind of grayed out right now.

25
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.400
There's no sources for it to record so there's not much for it to do.

26
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880
So let's add some sources.

27
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480
Now I have one crowd character selected.

28
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.160
I could right click on it, go to Select, Select All Crowd Characters, and then that way if

29
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.920
I do that and click right there, all of those characters are selected except for the third

30
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.560
person guy, which is what we want.

31
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.920
And then another way to do that is if I click on one of the crowd people I do Ctrl Shift

32
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.480
A, same thing, and then similar to the sequencer where you have a plus track button and then

33
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.680
you can add actors.

34
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.300
In the Take Recorder you can add a source for it to pay attention to for it to record.

35
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.120
So I'm going to hit the plus source button from Actor, Add Current Selection.

36
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:54.040
So now our crowd of five people is going to get recorded.

37
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.040
Now I mentioned you have to play first and then record, but the record part's a little

38
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.160
tricky sometimes.

39
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.760
So if I hit play, alright, I'm just doing my thing, I'm playing the game, but if I try

40
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.600
to move my mouse over to the Take Record section, I'm having a hard time getting to the record

41
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.280
button.

42
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.760
So in order to eject temporarily from the game and then record, there's a hotkey.

43
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.040
I want you to remember it's F8.

44
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.240
Now my mouse is free, I can hit record and then we have this countdown delay and then

45
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.720
it's recording something and then I hit stop.

46
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.400
And then I'm still playing, let me hit escape.

47
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.880
And now I'm back to where I was.

48
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.040
And then you might be wondering, okay, where did my take go because I saw it two seconds ago.

49
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.160
In order to see the most recent take, you go up to the top of the take recorder and

50
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.560
there's this icon that says review the last recording.

51
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.240
It looks like a film strip with a little eyeball.

52
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.440
And then now we can see our take.

53
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.920
So we've got more characters in there because we've got the characters that live in the

54
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:28.240
level normally, but we've also got the recorded versions that are spawning in there from the sequencer.

55
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.680
Now what if I don't want that delay?

56
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.680
You know, the countdown, the 3-2-1 that we saw earlier?

57
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.600
It's useful if let's say you're wearing a motion capture suit, but you're also the one

58
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.720
operating at the computer and you need some time to run back to your starting mark.

59
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.600
But you know, we're not doing that.

60
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:55.600
So in order to change that, let's use this return back to the pending take arrow so that

61
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.480
we can get ready for a new recording.

62
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.200
And then this show hide settings option right here looks like a bunch of gears.

63
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:15.520
If you click on that and you scroll all the way down to user settings, change countdown to zero.

64
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:24.800
And now as soon as you hit the record button, it will not have that countdown delay anymore.

65
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.560
So if your motion is fast, it's really helpful so you don't accidentally miss part of the motion.

66
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560
So let's try this again.

67
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.680
I'm going to hit play and then I'm going to hit F8 record.

68
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.000
Let it record for a bit.

69
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.800
Okay, stop record, stop playing.

70
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.240
And then let's go back to the take that we recorded by using the review the last recording button.

71
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.480
And here we are.

72
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:07.840
Now I can actually double click on these individual tracks and go inside and see what it recorded.

73
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.680
There's an animation track and then we've got the motion.

74
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.240
It gets keyframed on the transform track.

75
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:29.720
And if I actually go up and unlock this scene up in the top right, now the red outlines

76
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.200
disappear and when I double click inside of a track, I could actually adjust a lot in here.

77
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.380
I could shorten the animation.

78
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.520
I could delete keyframes.

79
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.880
I could make a character hold in a certain position for much longer than it already does.

80
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.880
Or let's say in the scene 1 underscore 2, I like all of the motion except for character

81
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880
5.

82
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.000
Well, you know what?

83
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:11.320
I could just delete him and we're fine.

84
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:17.160
And in fact, we could just delete that crowd character 5.

85
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.840
And then we've got a curated scene of just four extras.

86
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.860
Now if it's a little hard to decipher what's going on because we've got twice the number

87
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.840
of crowd people, we can go to the world outliner, which again is just like a table of contents

88
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.280
for what's in your scene.

89
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.040
We can hide the crowd people that are not currently being driven by the sequence that

90
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.000
we recorded.

91
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.800
And if you're wondering, okay, well, how do I know which ones those are?

92
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.640
So if there's not a lightning bolt icon, then it's a normal character that's living in the

93
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.140
level all the time.

94
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:06.440
But if it has this lightning bolt, it means the sequence is spawning it into the level

95
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440
temporarily.

96
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.800
And so I'm just going to hide the original crowd people.

97
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.480
Now this is what we're actually seeing in the level.

98
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:24.720
And it looks like we've got one mannequin that snuck in there.

99
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.520
And then if we examine this a little bit further, I'm just clicking inside one of the tracks.

100
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:37.800
If I right click on the animation clip and I go to properties, this will tell you, hey,

101
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.480
this is where that animation clip was recorded.

102
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.080
And we know it's under games, cinematics, takes, etc, etc.

103
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.720
Or you could just double click on the square itself with the image.

104
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.400
And then we can see the walking animation.

105
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.960
It's just walking in place.

106
00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:04.560
And then all of the transform information is what's moving the character to and fro

107
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.000
the space.

108
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.680
But if you wanted, and if your characters had different animations, maybe one was walking,

109
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.840
one was running, you could swap these out.

110
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.260
And if you want to know where the sequences live, we can go to content browser.

111
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:29.260
And let's go to cinematics, takes, and it's got a folder generated for us based on today's

112
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.300
date.

113
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.660
And then we've got the different level sequences.

114
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.660
And then we've got different sub scenes for each of those level sequences.

115
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:47.220
And in here, we've got our animation.

116
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.820
And then if I go back up here is the crowd character too.

117
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.680
Let's double click on that.

118
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.400
So it's broken up into different animation clips and level sequences.

119
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.800
And then if I'm ready to record yet another take, I can go to the return back to the pending

120
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.700
take button.

121
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.820
And then we're off to the races.
