00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
Now I mentioned we're going to make some modifications to the crowd system.

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.280
So first thing I want to slow down the characters so they're not running around.

3
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.800
And to do that let's go to crowd character blueprint.

4
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.240
And we're going to go to the character movement component.

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.520
Let's search for max walk speed.

6
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
Currently it's set to 600.

7
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:49.120
Now we've already talked about blend spaces but let's revisit that concept so we can pick a good value so it's walking comfortably.

8
00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:00.720
So if I go to third person example map and go to mannequin animations, double click on third person idle run 2D.

9
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.920
And then let's just hover over these values.

10
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.080
OK so I have a feeling 93.75 is going to be what we want because that is where the third person walk animation is introduced.

11
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.160
If it's zero he's idling.

12
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.880
If it's 375 he's running.

13
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
And if the value is 600 he's definitely running.

14
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.080
So if you just drag back and forth you can test what the animation would look like at different values.

15
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.680
But I'm definitely going to do 93.75.

16
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.280
So I will close that.

17
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.480
And go back to crowd character.

18
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.400
And let's change the value to 93.75.

19
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.600
OK hit save.

20
00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.440
And then if you remember last time these crowd characters they moved once and then they stopped.

21
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.720
So let's go ahead and add the repeat functionality before we test this again.

22
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.040
So let's go to crowd controller.

23
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:20.200
And what I want to do is just have this move happen over and over again with a little bit of a delay in between.

24
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
So it's actually really easy to set up.

25
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.720
You don't have to know about for loops and things like that.

26
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:37.720
So if I left click drag off of the execution and I just type in delay and it's not the retriggerable delay it's the straight up delay.

27
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.440
Let's add that node.

28
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:53.720
And I'm going to drag it up and above the simple move to location because what I'm going to do is say OK once this delay is completed go right back into the move.

29
00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.480
And then delay and then move and continue that process until we're not in play mode anymore.

30
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.560
Now point two seconds that's a little fast.

31
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm going to change that to two seconds and let's test this compile save.

32
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.200
Go back to third person example map hit play.

33
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.600
OK we've got some people walking around and they're moving all at the same time.

34
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.320
So they look a little too synchronized.

35
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.880
But we can fix that.

36
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:47.880
So if we go back to crowd controller one more thing I'm going to add I'm going to drag off of the duration input and type in random float in range.

37
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.240
So it generates a random number between a minute and Max and floats are just numbers that have decimal points.

38
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.240
So let's say OK between two and five seconds.

39
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.480
OK so that way the delays are a little bit offset breaks it up a bit.

40
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.720
So we'll do compile save.

41
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.560
Go back to third person example map hit play.

42
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.440
Let's take a look.

43
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.560
OK he moved but the other character didn't so I'd say it's working.

44
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:39.720
All right so we've set up the crowd simulation we've made adjustments and in the next video we're going to introduce the power of take recorder.
