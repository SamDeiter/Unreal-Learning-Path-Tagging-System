00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
I'm Erika Penck.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm your Unreal Authorized Instructor for today,

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.160
and we're doing retargeting in crowds.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.120
And you guys are in for a treat.

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840
So I want to give a big thanks to Alex Paschel,

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.640
who created the content for this course.

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.240
And here's what we're going over today.

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.520
So retargeting is what allows you to download animations

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.420
from the Marketplace or Mixamo and apply it to your character

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.700
or apply it to your metahuman, for example.

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.660
We'll cover how to create and control blend spaces,

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.460
which are useful for transitioning

13
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.080
between animations in games.

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.640
We'll even build off of our retargeting exercise

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.780
to complete the navigation in crowds portion.

16
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.940
And that will allow you to potentially fill out

17
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.860
a scene of pedestrians walking along a sidewalk

18
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.580
that you don't want to hand anime.

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.740
And today, all you need to do

20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.120
is open up a third-person template project,

21
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.160
turn on the Take Recorder plugin,

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.080
and then you're ready to follow along.
