  "text": " In this section, we're going to look at the Material Editor and Parent Materials. We're also going to take a look at instance materials and the relationship with Parent Materials and how to construct a material from scratch. So let's get started. In this first part, we're going to take a look at the overview of the Material Editor. So let me go ahead and switch into Unreal so you can actually see how this works. I have a material set up here, and later on, we're going to be building a material for this, duplicating what we have constructed. I'm going to show you some of the ins and outs for it. But first up, let's get an overview of that canvas and what we're going to be working with in there. I'm going to double click on that material that we've already have built. So let me walk you through some of the things we have here. And I'm going to do my best not to do too much buttonology, but talk about some of the primary things that you need to consider. Up here, you'll see we have our Save our Material here. It allows us to quickly save our material. We also have, if I simply change things, one called Apply. Now, the difference between these and what makes it really convenient is the fact if you don't want to commit to your material just yet, but you just want to apply it in this scene, you can. This will save it, which was a combination of applying and saving. But here, a simple Apply will allow you to test things out and determine whether you want it before you save, which is actually kind of nice. You can also go and find that material on the Content Browser. If you click on that magnifying glass, you'll see that it popped up there in the background. You can also search for content that you need and found. If your material is quite complex, you're like, hey, I need to find like the normal or something. You can actually have that at your disposal. And it'll show you where those connections are living. Down below, since we're already down here, you'll see there is a Substrate tab. We don't have Substrate enabled, but we also have a stats. One thing I do want to say about Substrate, don't get too excited just yet for it. It's still evolving. And since this video is made currently for 5.3, it's getting better and better. But if you turn it on, you can't go back to your regular materials. So keep that in mind. It's basically all or nothing type of value. So we're going to focus mainly on the primary or the current default material for Unreal. Down below, we have stats. This will tell you if there's an error. This will immediately, and it'll pop up even when it's closed. It'll let you know if there's an issue going on. There's a thing down here called, or over here up at the top called the palette. Basically, it's your quick search engine and shows you some of the hotkeys to pull things up, which are actually kind of convenient. Now you'll notice there isn't a hotkey for everything. Some of that takes a little bit finagling. We're not going to get into that type of customization, but you will see there's some primary hotkeys to be able to pull up some things that you may need or use more often than normal. Now you can pull that up simply by right-clicking, and you can do the same search. It's just a smaller package for searching those nodes that you need to pull up. Over here, you'll have a, there's a home. This will just take you directly to the final destination for your material connections. There is a hierarchy here. This allows you to see if there's any instances in this hierarchy. We don't have any right now. There's a live update, preview material. We want to keep that on, but you can also turn these on and off if you need them. And there's also a clean graph up. Now you want to be careful with this one. I do a lot of experimenting. I'll be able, you know, say I want to, I'll hit a one key, I'll bring in a constant. I'll hit an S key. This is his big brother, which is an exposed constant. It's called the scalar parameter, or yeah, it's basically making it so that the parameters are available to be tweaked. We'll just say this test. Now the problem that you can run into if you're not careful, if you hit cleanup, you may want to keep these around because you're experimenting, but if you hit cleanup, they're going to go away if they don't have any connection. So if there's no connection, those things will go away. So just keep that in mind, be careful about that. I always experiment. So you can also lower the quality of the visuals here. So if you need to simulate a particular output and go for a particular shader look, we, I have all on, which is a good method to tackle because then you can determine what it's going to look like on all levels, but you can isolate if you need to. And also we have hide unrelated. Now the hide unrelated, basically what it does, it makes it so that you can actually go in here and say a locked node state or focus on a whole chain. You can use that tool to your advantage if you want to. So if I collect this, let me give you an example how it works. If I grab these guys here and we say hide unrelated, it's basically going to ghost the ones that aren't selected. That's why you saw nothing happening right there, but you can see it now once it's selected, that will actually occur. And it makes it a little bit easier to visually look at things, especially if things get really super crowded. You can zoom in and zoom out. You can hit the left mouse button to drag and drop. There is a pro tip here. If you want to get even closer, you can hit control. And I do this every once in a while, hit control and wheel mouse and you get uncomfortably close to your nodes. They may try to do a restraining order on you, you get too close. They may think it's creepy. But you can actually get really close and take a look at them really quickly, which is actually kind of nice. And you also can look at your platform stats. This will tell you where things live and breathe based on your visuals that you're shooting for. Over here, if we go back to our slides here, there's some hotkeys that we need to consider. We're going to look at the preview window in just a bit and the details. But first, we have the number key for variable constant. That's the one key. And then the two key is the variable constant there. You're going to hear me say these quite often as I demonstrate the material. There's a number three key for another variable constant, four key for another variable constant. And these are like constant vectors. They have an E key for the power node, R key for reflection vector, T key for texture sample, U key for texture coordinates, B for bump, offset node, N key for normalized node, M key for multiply node, and T key for duplicate. Now, in older versions of Unreal, this was a different hotkey. But the D, I think, kind of makes sense. At first, I was fighting against it. How dare you change my keys? But in the end, I was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. That's fine. So let's go and take a look at the preview window. So the preview window is pretty handy. I love this thing. It's great. And if I hit the L key, you can see, I can just move around like in a regular viewport or perspective. If I hit the L key, I can change my light source. So if I want to check my reflectivity, I want to check my roughness, I can do that. See how my normals are being handled. All that's actually kind of nice. If I click on the grid here, you can see that I have the details here. Now we're going to be talking about this in just a bit. That is located just below our preview window. Well, let's actually spend a little more time in the preview window here. You can actually have the lit, unlit, all the different views that you normally get with Unreal. You can go perspective, top down, bottom, and you can choose whether you want to show the background or not, which is actually kind of nice. You'll see here, there is also a field of view and a few more things that you can turn on and off, such as real time and show frames per second. Most of the time, I'll be doing this frames per second within the editor itself and not so much here, but you do have those options if you wanted, and you can also control your layouts. Now down below here, we have three different types of shapes that we can, or four, primarily ones that we can choose from, from a flat plane, sphere, rectangle, and even a cube. Now there is a fourth option though, you'll see, or fifth, I should say, here at the bottom, which allow you to swap out the geometry. Let me show you how that works. It's actually pretty easy. So in our scene, we have a simple piece of geometry here. I'm going to go ahead and find that geometry in our content browser, make sure that it's selected. With it selected, I can go in here and click on that cinder block, and then Unreal will load that piece of geometry. There you go. And then now I can use that for my preview mode. Pretty nice. So that can be any mesh that you've chosen or you've created, and you can actually get that going in the right direction. All right, so let's go back to our slides here, and we're going to take a look at a few more things. So the concept of the material system, how it works. So what we were looking at just a second ago, that was the material, parent material. And in that parent material, we can construct variables and open up parameters to be able to create an instance material in which things are open so that we can change them on the fly. The benefit of it is an instance material makes it a lot lighter in your scene. It makes it so you don't have to recompile the parent material. We're actually recompiling, or we're actually looking at the parent material and we're making it so the instance materials make it a lot faster. So they're instances, they're children of this parent material. And it actually does lighten things up on your GPU, believe it or not, on your overall scene. So every material is a draw call. So if you're calling upon an instance in that scene, you're actually making things a bit lighter. So let's actually look at blend and lighting modes. So in our material editor, we have the ability to edit and custom. And remember, we've talked about how Unreal, we really want you to feel drunk with power, that you can build anything and do anything. Well, this is where these nodes in the detail section work out really well. As you can see here, we have a thing called material domain. If we pull this up, you'll see here we have a deferred decal. If you wanna put decals and dirt and grunge on the ground, whatever it might be, we can choose a light function. We can choose a volume if you want a fakey, volumetric effect, post-process or user interface. All those things are really powerful and helpful when it comes to the material domain. Down below, we have blend modes. This also is complimentary to whatever you may choose. And some of these are determined so that you have to use them in pairing with whatever you choose for material domain. In this particular case, we just have opaque, but you can choose masked if we have an alpha channel object, translucent for glass, edited, we also have some sort of masked or a type of alpha channel pushing object. We can also do modulate, alpha composite. So there's all these different ones, but each one is very particular for what you use them for. I'm not gonna get too much into geo and botanology, but I do wanna focus on these first few here so you know and understand how these work. Some of these come into play for your more advanced classes. So we have here shading model. In our shading model, we can choose many here, eye, cloth, subsurface profile, a two-sided foliage. All these are really great to be able to build your scenes. And you have these options to be able to choose them based on what you need. You can also make your material two-sided. Specifically, this is super helpful, especially if you see there's some holes in your shadows. So turning these on makes it so that it compiles correctly. And if you have a hollow type of, or I should say not a full piece of geometry object, this can actually make it so your light now understands that that is a flat surface that needs to be represented as if it actually is in the real world. So you won't have your light passing through with no shadow. You also can choose to cast shadows too. So it's really nice to be able to control some of this upfront. There is subsurface profile. You'll see these many times with the metahumans. So this allows us to have a little bit more complexity and to be able to control that in such a way. So there's a more believability to human skin and so forth. And you can see we also have a physical material. This makes it so that if you wanted to tweak things out a little bit more advanced, obviously there's a little more advanced concepts, but you can actually load profiles for that particular look and feel, or I should say nodes and assets. And we also have a nanite override material. Now this one here is very specific. So this is again, a little bit more advanced, but this allows you to, if you wanted to cater things in particular way into your scene and do a little bit more of a layering effect with a look and feel with your nanite. You can see we're having material loaded with a material. What does that even mean? That just allows us to be able to actually have some really advanced high quality fidelity visuals and using these nodes to push those things in that direction. You'll see there's a displacement, magnitude and center that we can have here too. And you can add that to your nanite object. So if I collapse that now, you'll see those disappear. Now there used to be displacement back in the day. We're gonna eventually look to adding that, but currently it is in development to bring that back and to work nicely with whatever objects such as nanite in particular, you'll notice we have a slot there, but we wanna be able to add that to a regular workflow also. So if you don't, aren't using nanite, you have the option to get that back. We're gonna raise that one from the dead again. There is translucent shadowing. Now we're not in translucent mode, but if I chose a translucent object, I should be able to choose my density scale, self shadowing and so forth. Now, if we go back to Unreal for a second here and go over here, you'll actually see those options pop up. If I select this glass, double click on that material, pull this material back in, you will now see there's some translucent object options that are now firing here. And I can choose my lighting mode. And these can be very expensive. So you have to choose wisely. And surface forward shading is probably the most expensive. So these things are actually pretty cool because you can customize the heck out of your scene. So let's go back to a regular material. There's also usage. Now usage is helpful, especially when you're compiling your shader. You're telling Unreal its intentions and doesn't have to pick walk through the other options. It can go directly to what you want. Hey, is it a weapon? Is this for the world? Is this used for water? You can actually turn those on ahead of time and speed things up a little bit. And then we have mobile. If you have mobile options, forward shading. A lot of times forward shading is used when it comes to VR, but now VR can be used with Lumen. But in the past, we would use forward shading quite often for VR just because you would be able to downplay a few things so that your performance was a bit better. You would lose some of your lighting abilities or tools, but you can use now Lumen with VR, but make sure you research that before you jump in. There's post-process material options, refraction control, as world, world position and so forth, and some light mass, which is our old school baking method. So a lot of cool things to be able to choose from and play with here, allowing you to customize your material and put it in the right direction. So you'll see there is the glass approach here, like we talked about, translucent and lighting mode, surface forward shading, like we mentioned. So in the next part, we're gonna go ahead and take a look at parent materials, and we're gonna be building an instance material. And that instance material basically is a copy of the parent material, but with exposed parameters. As you see here, there's albedo we can switch out, normal we can switch out, and rough. And we can do that on the fly without any recompiling. And we can actually use sliders to be able to change the values quickly. So let's go ahead and get that started in the next section.",
