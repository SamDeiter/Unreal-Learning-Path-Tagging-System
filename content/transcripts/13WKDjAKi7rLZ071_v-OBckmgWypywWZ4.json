  "text": " And so we've covered a lot of ground today. We've covered the optimization philosophies, optimizations across textures, materials, meshes. We've talked about the different view modes that you can, you have access to in the editor and also some tools that you can use for trying to really reduce some of that content that's being displayed on the screen that you're trying to get performance from. So thank you for checking out this course today. Hopefully you found some at least useful pointers in the directions that you can head to start optimizing your content. Maybe you've uncovered some tools or maybe some material functionality or some level of detail functionality that can really help get some big wins from your target platform. So again, coming back to this philosophy, you want to be doing this continuously throughout your project. You want to know the target platforms that you're trying to hit. And so you can make the different affordances. Again, it's hard to say what specific set of parameters you should be clicking. It's going to be very per project, but at least hopefully that presents some tools to get you started on your optimization journey.",
