  "text": " In this section, we will explore each of the material components that are used to create a crossfade transition, and look at how the Material Parameter Collection is employed to create the transition effect in Sequencer. Before we start, I want to begin by saying that Sequencer does not offer a native transition system for editorial transitions, like you might find in an offline editorial DCC package like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, or Final Cut. This tool system was created purely to show that Sequencer is capable of these actions with some creative solutions using the existing systems within Unreal Engine. As new tools are introduced and the new ideas implemented, this section will evolve or be replaced entirely. Now, let's get started with a look at the primary component, the CineCamera. When starting out, you will want to create two CineCamera actors. The Transition Camera, or TR-CAM1, will view the initial target, or you want to start your transition. The Target Camera, TG-CAM02, will view what you want to see next. The Material Graph now employs screen space UVs to ensure that the size of the rendered view matches the camera view exactly. This in conjunction with the new CineCapture Component 2D eliminates the need to manually set the aspect ratio of your rendered target texture. For the CrossFade, the Material Parameter Collection uses the fade amount to create the CrossFade or dissolve action by controlling the alpha. Now, let's jump into the Engine and take a closer look at the Material Graph. Picking up where we left off, let's look at the details on each of the CineCameras we are using in our transition. First, let's look at the TR-CAM01. This camera is the Transition Camera. It's where we set our starting point and apply the post-process material that makes the transition work to the camera. Once you've clicked on this camera, move on over to the Details panel and then search for Render. This will bring up the rendering features and the post-process materials. Underneath here, you'll find an array and that is where our material instance is applied for the appropriate transition. In this case, it's the CrossFade that we're using. Next, is the TG-CAM02. And you'll notice here there is a third cam, the TG-CAM01 camera, in the example level sequence. If we click on the TG-CAM02 and move over to the Details panel, you will notice a component called CCCBooth. The CCCBooth component is where the texture target is going to be located. This is where the render target texture that we create will be applied to the camera component. If you click over to the TG-CAM01, you will notice a similar component called the SCCBooth01 component. This is a Scene Capture Component 2D and it is different from the Scene Capture Component the Scene Capture Component 2D does not respect the Cine Camera's cinematic settings. Just like the Cine Capture Component, the Scene Capture Component does allow for the input and is where you will store your render target texture. Now let's move into the Material Transitions folder and double-click to open the mCrossFade only material. This way we can take a look at the material graph used to create the sequence or transition. Here we will explore the nodes that are needed to make the transition work and discuss the function before we jump back into the slides and recap the material graph. For the camera targets, you will see two main nodes set up inside the Texture Inputs box. The first is a Screen Texture Post-Processing Input 0 node which is used to display the transition using a post-process material attached to the transfer camera TRCAM01. A single Texture Sample Parameter 2D node is used to apply the target camera render texture target to the material expression texture base. Screen Aligned UVs are fed into the UVs of the target camera. The connections for each render target are then added to a Linear Interpolation node and an RGB Mask is applied to help manage the color output of the Scene Texture Post process as it's fed into the Lerp. The transition itself is handled by the Fade Amount Collection Parameter node controlling the alpha of the Lerp node. You can also help control the incrementation of the fade amount by using a Clamp node to set a minimum and maximum value for the fade amount. Finally, the Lerp results are fed into the M Crossfade Only material which must be set to Post-Process. And then, the post-process material blendable location must be changed to either before translucency or before tone mapping to get a screen accurate color from the camera. Once applied and saved, a material instance is then made of the base material and applied to the initial transition camera under the Post-Process material in the Camera Details panel. The end result allows users to add the Material Parameter Collection to Sequencer and keyframe the value of the fade amount to create a dissolve effect. Now let's play the example and see what the effect can look like. If I look at my Material Parameter, my fade amount is active and set to zero. If I lock my camera to the viewport and go ahead and hit play, you will see as it moves from one transition into the next fading out as my fade amount changes from the value of zero to one. Now let's pause this and then jump back into our slides and review the components we looked at today. Reviewing our slides starts with a list of cameras, components, textures, and nodes that were used in the construction of the material. Next, we check the material settings in the Material Graph to make sure that the material being used was a Post-Process material and set the blendable location to allow for accurate projection of the camera into the Post-Process material as noted in this slide. Inside the Material Graph, we looked closer at the inputs for the render targets that are used in the transition and discussed the use of a mask node to manage the RGB color output. After that, we explored the final connections and then made sure that the material was converted into a Material instance and applied to the initial CineCamera under the rendering features in the Post-Process materials as part of an array. This allowed us to add the material parameter collection to Sequencer and then view the keyframed scalar parameter called fade amount as it dissolved between the initial camera and the transition target creating a crossfade effect. So that's it for this section. In our next section, we will begin to wrap up the course with a few final recommendations, beginning with a look at project organization.",
