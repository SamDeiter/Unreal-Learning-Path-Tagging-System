  "text": " All right, we've almost reached the end of today's course. What we're going to talk about now is how to share your project once you've got it all ready to go. So there is a panel called the Media Panel, which we will show here as we get into Twin Motion. So we'll take a look at that. But just briefly going over it, you'll see that to export, all you merely have to do is to click the Export icon, then the image and select the image in the pop-up window. Next you'll just get to click the Start button at the very bottom and select the folder you want to export it to. It's that simple. Now there are some other exporting available to you, but let's take a look here first back into Twin Motion. And we're going to go to our little media right down here, the dock, and you'll see there's a bunch of different things available, which we didn't get into, but we will in later courses. But let's just say we want to export something. We'll say, I like that, so I'm going to click that. And now you'll see we have a simple image. Now there are other ones that were provided with this project, but we are not doing that right now. But now I just want to export it. To export, we merely come down here to the Export, click on that. And over here you'll see we have quite a few options of exporting. We can do a presentation, a panorama, a video. We can even upload it to the cloud for those that have subscriptions are able to upload to the cloud. So for now, we're just going to talk about the image. Later courses, we will go through each and every one of these. But for now, let's just go and click the image right there. And I did name it Class Project. So go ahead and hit on Class Project. And then start your export. And you should get where you want to select to export that scene to and wherever you want Go ahead and place that downloads, whatever. If you have a special folder and just hit select folder. And you'll get the exporting, give you an estimated time. And once that's done, that's it. You now have an image to share with someone, friends, colleagues, clients, whatever that will be available to you. You'll see it gives you an estimated time, how long, depending on your type of computer that you have. Now, here's a great link that shows other ways of sharing your projects, which when motions are documentation online. But that's it. I do hope you've enjoyed this. And let's move on to the final the wrap up.",
