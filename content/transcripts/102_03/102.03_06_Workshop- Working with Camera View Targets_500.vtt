1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
Next up, let's create a camera switch blueprint and with the blueprint what we'll do is we'll

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.740
set up a view target with some kind of blending going on so you can figure out how to set

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.320
cameras and blend from one camera to another.

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.040
We'll use a flip-flop node which is essentially a pick A and then pick B output and then repeat

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.740
itself so it goes A, B, A, B. We'll talk about arrays and how to use arrays so that's

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.180
a series of cameras in an array and then we'll talk about the multi gate node which can essentially

7
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.140
fire a different output with each input coming in.

8
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.420
So say you have a flow of information coming into a gate you can say okay output gate one,

9
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.420
output gate two, output gate three and it's essentially just helps figure out your flow

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.300
within Blueprint.

11
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.620
And again we're going to create a new Blueprint so I'm just going to right click and going

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.980
to go to Blueprint and I'm going to select actor first and I'm going to type BP underscore

13
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.500
camera switch.

14
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.660
Then the name doesn't necessarily matter so whichever you'd like to do I'm going to hit

15
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
enter to open it or you can double click.

16
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.280
I'm just going to make sure I save it first and foremost.

17
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.280
So the first thing we want to do is figure out how to change the view target with a blend.

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.440
So we want to blend maybe from the player character to a different camera that's based

19
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.440
in the scene.

20
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.760
So I'm going to go to the event graph.

21
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.160
I'm going to find some new space just right clicking and moving around.

22
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm going to first get player controller and the player controller so this bottom option

23
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600
here get player controller.

24
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.360
Want to select that and the camera data for the player inside of Unreal is housed on the

25
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.560
controller so whenever you want to interact with the player's camera you want the controller

26
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
here.

27
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.260
So we're going to drag off the blue line here and we'll type set view target with blend.

28
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.280
So I'll hit enter there and so we've got a view target from there.

29
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.760
Now what we want to do is we want to figure out what camera we want to be setting the blend to.

30
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.840
Now if I had done this in the level blueprint I could just directly select a camera from

31
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.480
the level but there's no way to select a camera currently.

32
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.520
If I go into my map and if I go to the cinematics tab here on the place actors so make sure

33
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.160
you have place actors which is just a select mode.

34
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.280
I can find a camera actor, I can right click, I can pilot the camera and I can just put

35
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.000
it into some kind of location where I say I want to blend to this camera.

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.520
Now if I want to eject out of there now just by pressing that eject button on the top left

37
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.680
I'll call my camera something I'm going to call this wide shot even well it's a medium

38
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.520
close up but let's call it a wide shot on the bushes.

39
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.000
So I've given my camera a name but even if I have this selected I can't now add it to

40
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
my blueprint.

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
If I right click I can't add it to my blueprint whereas if I went to my level blueprint so

42
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.240
I go to blueprints up here open level blueprints and if I right click in some empty space I

43
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.340
have a direct reference to the bushes camera because this is the level blueprint.

44
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.020
This untitled here is referencing this untitled map name and so I have direct control so if

45
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.620
you're only doing something level specific it's a much cleaner and faster workflow just

46
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.860
to start adding stuff inside of this blueprint whereas if you want to do it through a blueprint

47
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.700
we're going to have to create a reference inside of this camera switch.

48
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.780
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up the BP camera switch if you don't already

49
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.700
I'm going to go to variables I'm going to click plus variable here and I'm just going

50
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.340
to call this maybe camera ref one it doesn't matter necessarily what you call this as long

51
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.540
as it's a consistent name so I'm just going to go to camera ref one as we've done previously

52
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.660
let's just give it a category straight away so I know I can keep everything organized

53
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.460
so I'm just going to give it a category of cameras and what I want to do is change the

54
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:41.340
variable type to a cine camera so the cine camera variable type is this actor and now

55
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.660
what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a soft object reference so if I hover over

56
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.780
cine camera actor you can create an object reference I prefer to use soft object reference

57
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.540
the reason for that is because the top object reference is a hard reference.

58
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.460
takes longer to process hard references and if the hard reference gets broken it can crash your

59
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.900
projects whereas if you use a soft object reference Unreal knows which reference it

60
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.740
should be using but it won't cause as many issues so moving forward just a good tip and

61
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.060
workflow practice is to create soft object references where you can so I'm going to click

62
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.180
create soft object reference I'm going to expose this variable as we did on our bush blueprint so

63
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:35.060
and then I'm going to compile and save and now if I go back into my map and I say let's drag and

64
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.060
drop the camera switch actor in here I just move it into a location and sometimes what I do as well

65
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.940
this isn't functional this is purely aesthetic so it's up to you if you do this but the BP

66
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.620
underscore camera switch I'm going to add a component on this component I'm going to type

67
00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:02.900
billboard I'm going to add a billboard and by default it's called billboard I'm just going to

68
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.340
call this icon now if you want to assign custom sprites you can do by default this is a dinosaur

69
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.820
head which is a legacy Unreal Engine sprite but what I'm going to do is oh I'm going to drag and

70
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.180
drop the icon over the default scene root so I want to replace the scene root with this icon now

71
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.180
when I compile and save I have this little dinosaur head in my map so again you could

72
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.900
create your own icons for this camera switch blueprint and so you know exactly where this

73
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.740
blueprint is placed completely optional has no functional consequence other than usability but

74
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.500
that's a really good good tip to use what we'll see here though is we have a camera ref one here

75
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.540
which is what we called our first variable and it's got non selected now it's going to be very

76
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.700
easy to select the the first wide shot from this list if I click down the list because I've only

77
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.140
got one camera if you've got a map with say a hundred cameras you could search the specific

78
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.460
reference but if you're not sure what name you need you can also just pick the actor from the

79
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.700
scene so I'm going to select the pick actor from scene and I'm going to click that so now we've

80
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:15.060
assigned wide shot bushes to camera ref ref one what we want to do now is we want to add some kind

81
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.980
of event that fires when we load up the level so for now what I'll do is I'll just go and begin

82
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.940
play so if I actually just play this map to show you what happens first and foremost if I click play

83
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:36.740
nothing happens I've just got a fly around viewport I've just got some default game mode if I go back

84
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.060
and I've just hit escape there just to come out of it so if I go to BP camera switch I'm going to

85
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:50.700
right-click type begin play hit enter and then I'm going to drag off begin play set view target

86
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.660
which is I'm going to compile and save now we just need to set a new view target now I'm going to

87
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:04.380
hold ctrl and left mouse drag to camera f1 and because it's a soft reference we could create a

88
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.980
hard reference which would have been blue to blue but because it's a soft reference we first need

89
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:15.700
to drag off and resolve this so just type resolve hit enter now it creates a blueprint

90
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.220
blue pin sorry so this soft object reference resolves itself to say yes I exist now this is

91
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.860
the reference if it was a hard reference you could get validity issues if the camera reference gets

92
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.460
lost at any point by that I mean if that for example doesn't get filled out by someone and

93
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:41.660
it says a none that's a hard object reference to no cameras which can cause a project to crash

94
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.340
whereas if it's a soft object reference even if it was none you'd be fine unreal would just it

95
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.740
wouldn't work because there's nothing plugged in but it also would prevent stability issues but we

96
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.740
do know what our camera is we want to create wide shot bush we have a camera f plugged in here we

97
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.420
have our set view target I'm going to compile and save and now I'm going to play and we instantly

98
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.940
have that wide shot of the bushes and that's because it's fired on begin play so we can add

99
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.660
some more complex functionality for now but for now it's quite a lot of powerful blueprint

100
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.340
functionality going on we've got some kind of camera switch manager going on we've created a

101
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.700
camera reference and we've also got variables connected to this blueprint which can add some

102
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.540
starting functionality for a camera switch blueprint
