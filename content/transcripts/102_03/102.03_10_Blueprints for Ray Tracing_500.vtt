00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
To close out this video, let's talk about creating blueprints for ray tracing.

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.840
So we'll talk about the level blueprint for real-time tests and then also talk about editor

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.120
utilities with widgets, which really powerful functionality that you can make use of even

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.840
outside of ray tracing.

5
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.060
So the first thing we want to touch upon is that console commands can be used with blueprints

6
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.380
to help optimize visuals such as ray trace reflections, the max distance.

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.740
You can use these in the level blueprint to execute the console command and it's just

8
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.540
this execute console command function that you can see in the editor here.

9
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.420
Now a really nice useful tip is that you can dump console commands into the output log,

10
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.100
which will show you all the commands that you can use.

11
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.820
So I'll just show you an example of that now.

12
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.220
So if we're back in our editor, you have a console window at the bottom here.

13
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.900
So you can just type dump console commands and you'll start seeing it up here at the

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
top.

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.860
Now you can go ahead and select that or you can just type in the whole thing.

16
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.260
So I'll just press the up key to go and select it, hit enter.

17
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.540
And then if we go to our output log along the bottom, you'll see everything that's

18
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.540
just been dumped.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.940
So you'll see the command dump console commands and you'll see everything that you have access

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.220
to inside of Unreal.

21
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.740
So if you were in your level blueprint, say we just had the previous example, if we had

22
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.340
a begin play and console command, execute console command, you could type whatever console

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.700
commands you want that are relevant to your scene in there and they'll fire off when

24
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.620
the level loads.

25
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.860
The last thing to mention in this section is that you can also use the help with console

26
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.180
variables which will give you a complete list of definitions opening inside of a hyperlink.

27
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.620
So a lot of these console commands can be found online as well.

28
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.940
So that should help just really refine what you want your scene to be doing.

29
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.540
We can also use editor utility widgets, which as I mentioned just a couple of minutes ago,

30
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.860
they're very, very powerful and can house a lot of information inside of Unreal.

31
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.380
So we can create editor utility widgets through right clicking in the content browser and

32
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.140
going to editor utilities and then editor utility widget.

33
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.100
So they can be powerful for linking control and editor of the editor itself.

34
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.820
Once opened, the UMG has its own blueprint as well and it allows for custom buttons we

35
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.140
can link in console command.

36
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.300
So to give you an example of this, we can open an editor utility, select some buttons

37
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.340
and assign some console commands to this button.

38
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.380
So if I jump back into the editor and then just go into my blueprint folder, I have this

39
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.500
editor utility here, which I can double click for now.

40
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.780
And you'll see that in the designer at the top right, so this is just the Unreal Motion

41
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.580
Graphics window, the UMG window.

42
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.780
We've added two buttons here, which we've just created from the common palette here.

43
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540
We've got button zero and button one.

44
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.900
And what we can do in our graph, if we go over to our graph and we see our buttons and

45
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.380
what we can do is we can select the first button.

46
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.780
And then if you see the events tab down in the bottom left hand side here, you can see

47
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.020
the on clicked.

48
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.500
So we'll just click on clicked.

49
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.940
That says on click to button zero.

50
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.700
And then we see button one as well.

51
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.260
Repeat that process on clicked.

52
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.940
And then you can fire off whatever console commands you'd like.

53
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140
I mean, you can fire off any scripting really.

54
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.740
That's what makes editor utility so powerful.

55
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.980
But in this example, if you wanted to run two different ray tracing console commands,

56
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.540
for example, you could do that.

57
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.860
And then you could just compile and save.

58
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.700
And then in the editor window, if you right click this editor utility and just go to run

59
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.820
editor utility, you've got this little box that appears and you've got these two buttons.

60
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.300
Now you can imagine the functionality where you can pin these editor utilities into your

61
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:24.060
editor and they have really powerful functionality where you could toggle between different outputs.

62
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.580
You can double click this.

63
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.500
You could add names onto these buttons by adding a text render into there and calling

64
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.380
them, you know, set ray tracing to three or, you know, whatever variables you're playing

65
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.260
with on the console commands.

66
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.700
And then with this functionality, you would have some customizable windows inside of Unreal

67
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.940
just editing the content in a more efficient and streamlined way to try out different variations

68
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.940
for your project.

69
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.180
So hopefully that gives you a good idea about console commands and also using editor utilities,

70
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.540
especially in relation to ray tracing.
