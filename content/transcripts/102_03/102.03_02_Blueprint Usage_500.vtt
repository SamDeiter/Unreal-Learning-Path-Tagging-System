1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.020
So we'll start off by talking about blueprint usage and blueprints are used to drive level

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.440
based events.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.140
So they control internally scripted behaviors for in game actors and you can even control

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.320
complex animations for game characters.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.560
So the blueprint system, you'll see these windows across many different editors, whether

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.320
or even Niagara audio blueprints can be used to be the code driven driving block behind

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280
different real time interactions.

8
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.280
So what are blueprints?

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.720
So in their basic form blueprints are visual scripts that use to add new functionality

10
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.200
to your game by connecting the nodes, events and functions, which is what you see in the

11
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.640
images here with wires.

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.720
So you can create some kind of intended interactive outcome.

13
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.080
So you'll see that we have events which are setting these red nodes on the right hand

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.000
side and then you'll see some kind of function based gameplay.

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.640
So the functions are the blue node on the top right hand corner, for example, connected

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
to some kind of variable data.

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.000
So you'll see these wires connecting and it's almost like a chain of events.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.820
You can follow the logic from left to right and get the intended outcome of what you want

19
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.840
your blueprint to be.

20
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.200
So we'll dive into the editor later in this course, but just to give you a bit of an overview

21
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.100
of the interface you may expect to see inside of Unreal.

22
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.320
So when we open our blueprint editor, which you can do by clicking the node graph on the

23
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.080
top of your editor and just go to open level blueprint, you can see that.

24
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.160
But just to dig into a bit more detail here, so we have the text menus on the top, which

25
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.760
you'd expect to see across all of Unreal Engine.

26
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.960
But the bar that you'll be using a lot is on this number two section here.

27
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.960
So you have compile, which every time you're editing a blueprint or changing the functionality,

28
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.000
you want to make sure you compile and save and it just keeps the iteration going.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.320
You can ensure that although the code is working correctly and of course saving your

30
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.560
work at frequent stages because especially when you're first getting familiar with blueprints

31
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.360
and maybe you connect some nodes that may end up crashing or failing, you just want

32
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.480
to keep that information safe so that if the editor does shut for whatever reason, you've

33
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.560
not lost any work.

34
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.560
We can browse content and find content and change settings slightly more complex.

35
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.820
A good thing to point out on the right hand side here is you can debug information as

36
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.820
well.

37
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.000
So when we get into the workshop, we can show you how to do that, but you'll very commonly

38
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.280
be using the compile and save a lot in this section.

39
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.760
Number three is where your components live.

40
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.840
So a blueprint, say it houses multiple components.

41
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.760
So say you had a vehicle in your production and you wanted to add some headlights to that

42
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.960
vehicle.

43
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.980
So you'd add maybe two spotlights to that vehicle.

44
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.480
Now the spotlights would be in this component list.

45
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.480
So not only would the vehicle be there as a static mesh, the two headlights would then

46
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.280
be there and you can see that any extra elements you're adding to that vehicle are all components.

47
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.040
So say you added a separate door mesh or some kind of information inside the vehicle like

48
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.520
some boxes or anything like this.

49
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.940
These would all be components within this blueprint.

50
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.380
Then you've got number four, which is your blueprint panel.

51
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.260
So this is where all of your functions live.

52
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.700
It's where all the inputs.

53
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.360
So we've got both an event begin play, which fires at the very start of the game.

54
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.020
And again, I'm just giving an example here.

55
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.020
We'll get into much more detail later on, but this fires at the start of the game and

56
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.660
you can see the F key being pressed on the keyboard.

57
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.260
So we can see event begin play on the left hand side and F as they're both inputs that

58
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.120
fire during runtime.

59
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.100
You've got your functions that live here and your construction script, which we'll be going

60
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.120
into again in this course.

61
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.840
And then this is where your variables live.

62
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.600
So you can create different variables, booleans, integers, floats, whatever kind of variables

63
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.880
you need to drive some kind of gameplay conditions.

64
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.500
Event dispatchers also live here and event dispatchers help with blueprint communication.

65
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.360
It's almost like a message that gets sent out to another blueprint, which we will of

66
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.380
course dig into.

67
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.100
Number five is where all the main action is happening.

68
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.820
This is where you're connecting your wires and your nodes to get the desired outcome.

69
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.140
A few important things to point out here.

70
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.200
Viewport will go to the visual view of what the blueprint is.

71
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.540
So say going back to this vehicle example from your components on the left hand side,

72
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.980
if you go to viewport, you can then view that vehicle.

73
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.800
The construction script is something that fires every time you compile the blueprint.

74
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.580
So if you want any kind of custom editor functionality or some default property setting, the construction

75
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.060
script is a great way to do that.

76
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.880
The event graph will always be at runtime.

77
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.100
So whenever you've got your main bit of the interactive experience that you're creating,

78
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.140
that's where all of the blueprint will live.

79
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.920
And you'll see that we have almost like functional blueprints and then an arrow saying event

80
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920
graph.

81
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.280
Each you can create sub layers and sub layers of blueprints.

82
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.140
So you can almost nest blueprints within other blueprints.

83
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.780
So you may even see multiple graphs appear in here as well.

84
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.260
And then also you can open up your function, which is a print text function.

85
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.180
So you can see this function over here, which says print text.

86
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.680
And that also lives up there.

87
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.540
So number six, this is where we can change all the details of the content that we've

88
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.540
created.

89
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.200
So in this example, we've created a new Boolean value down on the bottom left here.

90
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.680
And then by selecting this Boolean value, you'll see that it's got a great naming convention

91
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.200
new var underscore one.

92
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.120
But then you can edit new var underscore zero, sorry, no, one here.

93
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.080
So you can see that the variable types of Boolean, you can change a bunch of properties

94
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.800
here, which again, we'll be digging into in more detail throughout this course.

95
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.400
But that's just to give you a basic overview of the editor.
