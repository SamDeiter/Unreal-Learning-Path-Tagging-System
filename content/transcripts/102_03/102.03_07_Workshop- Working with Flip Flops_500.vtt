1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680
So next up we'll add some flip-flop node functionality.

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.920
So unlike a gate function this allows you to only cycle through two options.

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.920
Whenever there's an input execution on this left hand side it'll fire out A and then it'll

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.740
fire out B and then it'll return to A so it'll go A B A B every time it's entered.

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.580
So there's some more documentation on flow control if you'd like to follow up but let's

6
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.420
go ahead and add some flip-flop functionality into our project.

7
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.540
To start thinking about how we will use a flip-flop we need a way to have multiple inputs instead

8
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.920
of a single begin play.

9
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.780
So we'll replace begin play with a keyboard input instead.

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.900
I'll right click and for this I'll just use a hash key because it's easy to find.

11
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.980
You can add any keyboard event you want.

12
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.380
It's sometimes hard if you wanted like the C key for example you'd have to scroll through

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.300
all these to find an input called C but a quick way as well is if you right click hit

14
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.580
hash key and add a keyboard element hash you can also click this button here and then say

15
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.900
C from there and it'll override to C.

16
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.020
So that's just a quick way I always just right click add a hash key and then change it to

17
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.500
whatever I want because it's the quickest way to get there.

18
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.340
So completely up to you what workflow you use I'm just going to delete C and keep my

19
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
hash key.

20
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.940
I'm going to move the hash key to the left a bit.

21
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.060
If you have these around I'm just going to select them and delete and next I want to

22
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.300
add a flip-flop.

23
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.740
So I'm going to drag off pressed and type flip and then you'll see a flip-flop so I'm

24
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.620
going to hit enter with it selected there at the bottom.

25
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.340
So we've got a flip-flop we'll go from A into the first view target and we'll go B

26
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.300
into the second view target.

27
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.460
Now we can change the blend times if we want or the blend exponents they will edit the

28
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.380
blend time so you'll transition from one camera to another instead of snap.

29
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.120
For this example I'm just going to keep the snap functionality though.

30
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.900
So I'm going to copy which is ctrl C and ctrl V for paste.

31
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.060
I'm going to drag the controller into the target here.

32
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.980
I'm going to go from B into the execution input.

33
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.140
I'll drag the controller somewhere which is a little easier to see and just so we keep

34
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.340
things nice and organized.

35
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.740
Now the next thing I will do is add another camera reference actor.

36
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.140
So you can right click and duplicate.

37
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.340
I like to just create a new variable and call it camera ref 2.

38
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.060
I'm going to give it a category and you want to make sure that the variable type is that

39
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.260
cine camera again.

40
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.180
Again I'm going to use a soft reference.

41
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.460
The reason why I don't duplicate and I instead opt to create a new variable.

42
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.620
I've just found in the past if I duplicate some variables with soft references and when

43
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.220
we package them into projects I just end up with some bugs sometime in the referenced

44
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.220
variables here.

45
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.460
So not quite sure what workflow that is but I always just create a new one.

46
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.540
You'll see that it's not got camera ref 2 there.

47
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.740
So I'm just going to jump back in.

48
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.220
I'll expose that property then compile and save.

49
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.100
Now the last thing we want to do is add well I guess before that we need to add our camera

50
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.500
reference.

51
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.340
I've just noticed that so I'm going to hold ctrl and mouse drag.

52
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.820
The reason why I hold ctrl is just if I just left mouse drag it says get offset.

53
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.940
If I hold ctrl and drag it it'll get it and if I hold alt and drag it'll set.

54
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.780
So that's like a nice little tool tip.

55
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.860
You just want to make sure that's resolved again.

56
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.380
So drag off there hit resolve.

57
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.460
Go to new target.

58
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.420
Now by default actors don't consume input so you won't be able to press this button

59
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.300
by default.

60
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.820
If I compile and save and I go into my map and I hit alt and p to play and I hit the

61
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.020
hash key I can see nothing is happening.

62
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.500
Now the benefit over a level blueprint is if I and this is again just found by going

63
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.460
to the level blueprint.

64
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.420
If I added an input here that would work perfectly fine.

65
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.980
And so if you want some kind of user input the level blueprint can sometimes be the

66
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.020
easiest approach.

67
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.020
But because I want to keep this contained within this blueprint what I'm going to do

68
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.820
is I'm going to right click add another begin play event.

69
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.980
I shouldn't say another.

70
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.020
You can only have one begin play event but because in a blueprint sorry but because I

71
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.540
deleted it previously for the hash key I can now use it for something else.

72
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.340
I'll get a reference to the player controller.

73
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.260
So I'll just control C and control V.

74
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.220
I could have dragged a wire up there but it's just going to get turned into spaghetti.

75
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.660
And then on the player controller I just want to enable input.

76
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.860
Now this is a little bit of a hacky solution.

77
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.340
I'll just hold down control and move that input to player controller.

78
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.140
Just to make sure.

79
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.660
There we go.

80
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.140
So I've dragged that.

81
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.020
I've got a wire going into player controller.

82
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.300
Compile and save.

83
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.780
And it is a hacky solution.

84
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.980
For these kind of projects it's fine because you're not going to be relying on any kind

85
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.820
of game architecture.

86
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.780
But in a video game for example you wouldn't want to do this.

87
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.620
This just would override it in ways that wouldn't be reliable when moved into the code.

88
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.100
So we just want to test this now.

89
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.540
So I'm just going to make sure you compiled and save.

90
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.220
I'm going to jump into my map.

91
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.060
I'm going to hit alt and P or you can press the play button at the top.

92
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.020
I like alt and P just gives a quick shortcut.

93
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.300
And now what I want to do is I want to press hash on the keyboard.

94
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.340
And so we have got functionality.

95
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.340
The main remaining thing to do now is just add a second camera.

96
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.420
So I'm going to select my camera that I have.

97
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.740
I'm going to hold down alt and drag.

98
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.100
I'm going to right click.

99
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.220
I'm going to pilot it.

100
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.260
I'll just put it into a new location.

101
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.580
Maybe this is extreme close up.

102
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.540
I'm going to eject.

103
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.620
Maybe I'll call this close up bushes now.

104
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.820
Again the naming for this specific project isn't necessary but just to keep things organized.

105
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.980
It's good to just organize as you go.

106
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.460
I'll set my dinosaur head.

107
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.540
I'll go to my camera ref 2.

108
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.300
I will assign the camera ref 2.

109
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.700
And let's hit escape just because I don't like having things selected whilst in editor.

110
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.180
I'm going to hit alt and P to play.

111
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.460
I'm going to hit the hash key.

112
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.980
And there we go.

113
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.500
And if I hit hash again it snaps to the second camera.

114
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.940
And the great thing now about the floor control is if I hit hash again

115
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.180
so it keeps flip flopping and flip flopping.

116
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.820
So a bit of bonus for you now.

117
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.220
Not mandatory but in case you didn't have anything working for example

118
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.100
we can go into the camera switch.

119
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.620
I can drag and drop the window down into some different real estate.

120
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.740
I go back into my map and depending on where you've got your window

121
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.380
you might be able to see this drop down.

122
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.940
Or if it's a smaller window you can just go to the arrow keys

123
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.540
and make sure that this down here.

124
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.580
I'll just try and select it.

125
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.860
The property at the bottom says BP camera switch.

126
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.620
Again just dragging it out here.

127
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.300
The real estate of my screen isn't allowing that interaction

128
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.740
but if I just drag it out here I want to make sure BP camera switch is selected

129
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.860
which the debug object is in this dinosaur head.

130
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.860
This is called BP camera switch and debug is on BP camera switch.

131
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.420
Now what I can do is I can zoom out and just again I'm just trying to

132
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.060
fight with the real estate of my window here but I care about this section here.

133
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.300
So you'll see now when I jump in I can debug this and show that the inputs are firing.

134
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.700
So if I hit Alt and P now if I press hash you'll see that first line

135
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.900
firing out to the set view target in the bottom of my screen here.

136
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.860
Second line is flowing out to the B and so we keep going A B A B A B.

137
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.260
So we can see that control working and it's also just a nice way to introduce

138
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.260
debugging into your scenes if something isn't working.
