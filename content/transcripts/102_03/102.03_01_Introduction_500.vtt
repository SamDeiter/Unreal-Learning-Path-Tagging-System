00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training, which is a quick start to blueprints

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.880
for virtual production.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320
So to give you a bit of an overview of the blueprints that we're going to be covering

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.040
today, we'll be talking about blueprint usage and what blueprints are.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.080
We'll dive into the editor and talk about the different interfaces you'll expect to

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.520
see within blueprints.

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.640
We'll talk about the types of blueprints.

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.600
We also have a concept called level blueprints, which we'll give more context to.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.040
And then we'll talk about blueprint classes along with other classes.

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280
We'll talk about some basic scripting terms.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.280
We'll talk about interfaces and how you communicate between different blueprints.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.600
And then we'll also finish up with some inheritance.
