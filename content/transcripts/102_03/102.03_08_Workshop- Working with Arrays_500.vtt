00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
Next up, we'll talk about arrays.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.380
So just with the variable values, blueprints can store data within arrays.

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.580
So if you're not versing programming, you can think of an array as a collection of variable

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.300
all housed within a single unit.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.680
So whereas a single integer was just able to store one number, an array of integers

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.160
would be able to store multiple values.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680
So an array can only hold values of a single type.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.040
So if we've created an integer, you can only hold integers in here.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.380
And array variables will contain 3 by 3 color grid, which is what you can see in the image

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.880
here to show that they are arrays and not regular variables.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.020
So in the case of a disconnected array, that gray will have a darker center.

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.880
So once centered, once connected, sorry, the entire grid will be visible as seen below.

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.220
And then to create them, we can just click on this variable icon, drop down to array.

14
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.420
So let's go ahead and add some more functionality to our camera switch mechanic now.

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.480
And once back in the editor, I can full screen this window again, drag it up to the top.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.500
And let's create an array from this switch here.

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.280
So instead of flip flop in between the two, now let's try creating an array of cameras

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.260
to view our lens through.

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.700
So I'm just going to remove the flip flop for now.

20
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.780
I'm just going to click it and delete it.

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.220
I'll just be focusing on this one view target for now.

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.940
And instead of connecting to a single camera, I'm going to hold down alt and disconnect

23
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.940
this camera ref one.

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.020
I am just going to drag it over here.

25
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.800
I'm going to hold down alt on camera ref two and just drag it over there as well.

26
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.860
You can also just right click and break links if you need to break a link.

27
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
Now what we'll do is we will make an array from these cameras.

28
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.300
So I'm going to drag out of this camera.

29
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.900
I'm going to do make array.

30
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.660
So let's just try array.

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.940
So you just want to select make array there.

32
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.380
Drag that into place.

33
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.860
And we want to add a pin.

34
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000
So I'm going to use maybe three or four different cameras for this.

35
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.560
So let's just add pin, add pin, add pin.

36
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.840
I'm going to drag this into here.

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.000
And now let's create a few more, well, two more camera reference.

38
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.240
So camera ref three and then camera ref four.

39
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.240
I'm going to make sure I categorize these into the cameras.

40
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.040
Again not necessary, but it just helps keep things organized.

41
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.480
And you want to make sure you click the little i to expose them as public variables.

42
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240
So I'll compile and save.

43
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.840
And then the first thing I'll do is I'll just create a couple more cameras.

44
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.920
So I'll maybe create a top down shot here.

45
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.720
So pilot.

46
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.400
I'll eject here.

47
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.320
I'll just rename this.

48
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.560
Top down bushes.

49
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:22.600
And then maybe just do an extreme close up for some reason other than non practical purposes.

50
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.720
So it's even out of focus, but extreme close up bushes.

51
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.280
And I'll also click my dinosaur head.

52
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.800
And then I'll select my top down camera as my next camera.

53
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.240
And I'll select my extreme close up as my next camera.

54
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.840
So got four camera references, four cameras assigned.

55
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.320
Now we can jump into doing the array.

56
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.520
So I'll go back into my camera switch.

57
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.640
I've made my array.

58
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.600
I can drag out these references holding down control on my keyboard.

59
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.640
I'll just copy and paste these resolves.

60
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.120
Not with extra variable selected, so just variable copy and paste, copy and paste, which

61
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.040
is just control C, control V on the keyboard.

62
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.320
Drag out here.

63
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.800
We've got our array connected up.

64
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.160
So you should see something like that.

65
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.400
Then what we'll do is on the array, we'll get.

66
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.040
So we'll get a copy.

67
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.480
So what this get will do is it will say from this list of cameras, get a specific variable.

68
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.280
So what we want to do is we want to promote this one now to get camera.

69
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.720
So I'll drag off here, promote it to a variable and I'll call it get camera.

70
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.480
And now this is actually an integer and we want it to be an integer.

71
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.960
So that's fine.

72
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.040
And I'm just going to give it a category of cameras.

73
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.920
So it keeps things nice and organized still.

74
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.280
Now because we're getting a specific camera reference, we can say new view target is this

75
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.280
one.

76
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.600
That will actually say, depending on the list of what you want to do, you can get a specific

77
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.720
camera from this list.

78
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.160
So if I put this in here and I tested it out and I said, say I wanted to expose this, get

79
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.440
cameras, compile and save.

80
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.460
And you could say in your blueprint, get camera two, for example, and it would only display

81
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.720
camera two.

82
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.080
So that's pretty powerful functionality in itself.

83
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.920
And so let's just test that out.

84
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.800
Let's do, let's connect this in.

85
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.960
Let's do this.

86
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.080
Compile, save.

87
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.480
I'll click number two on here and it'll set a specific camera for us when we hit the hash

88
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.000
key.

89
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So there you go.

90
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.120
It's got camera two from the list, which is our top down camera.

91
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.520
Just worth noting in mind, camera ref three is our top down camera.

92
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.120
Number two, you might be thinking that it should have been the close up.

93
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.720
Now, a thing to note about arrays is that it actually starts at zero.

94
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.440
So it goes zero, one, two, three.

95
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.560
So if it helps name things in your head more clearly, if you put camera ref zero, camera

96
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.160
ref one, two and three, that's fine.

97
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.640
But in case your integers are off by one, that'll be why, because arrays start at zero.

98
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.920
If we go back into our camera switch, you'll see make array is zero, one, two, three.

99
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.760
That's just something to keep in mind there.

100
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.680
And then finally, we'll talk about multi gate cameras.

101
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.940
So instead of using an array, we can use a multi gate, which is essentially just a flow

102
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.940
of information.

103
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.360
A gate will choose which camera to set.

104
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.480
So I'm just going to hold down alt and drag out, move this into its own space.

105
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.760
We'll be using multiple set view targets again.

106
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760
So I'll keep that here.

107
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.840
I'm just going to copy and paste that third view target just so we have more to play with.

108
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.880
And I'm just going to drag that into the target just so we can see that happening.

109
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.440
I'm just going to get organized here.

110
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.200
So what we want to do is we want to add a multi gate node now.

111
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:18.680
So we'll type in multi and we'll select the multi gate from the list.

112
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.860
We'll add a pin.

113
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.480
So we've got out zero, out one, out two.

114
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.560
And we'll just select these two, the desired cameras, the desired view targets, shall we

115
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560
say.

116
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.160
And then I'm going to copy and paste the camera references that we had before and just plug

117
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.760
them into their respective view targets.

118
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.760
So again, you can drag out each variable individually if you wanted.

119
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.180
I'm just going to copy and paste them since we have them from the previous example.

120
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:51.200
And then what we want to do is after we've plugged them all in, create a switch camera

121
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.720
from the loop.

122
00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.100
So if we drag off the loop here and then we want to promote it to a variable, we can call

123
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.380
this switch cam.

124
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.780
Again, I'll just keep it in its category so we know what this is.

125
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.060
And then we want to create a scene switch from this float value here.

126
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.740
So I'll drag off again from the index and we'll promote this to a variable and we'll

127
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:32.020
call this scene switch and I'll assign it a category again and then compile and save.

128
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.380
And then I'll expose these just as we had before just in case we need extra functionality

129
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.820
And we could do our event.

130
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.060
Instead of cameras, we could try assigning multiple categories.

131
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.420
Could even call this something like multigate.

132
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.620
And so I know that these variables are connected to the multigate just in case that separation

133
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.220
is of use to you.

134
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.960
And then we just want to compile and save.

135
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.420
So we can do that and then we'll jump into our level.

136
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.920
Once you've saved and compile, you'll see that the multigate heading is here.

137
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.480
So we've not got switch cam or we've not got scene switch set.

138
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.320
So we can again use that blend time if we wanted to between the cameras.

139
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.400
If we just go ahead and set this actually, let's set this to a value of one, value of

140
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.160
one, value of one.

141
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.960
We can use a blend time for motion between cameras.

142
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.000
So we could even just test that out in this example.

143
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.640
So if I hit Alt and P now and press hash, we then pan to that one and then we go to

144
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.480
the next target and then we go to the next one.

145
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:53.240
But now if I press hash again, it's not going to work because what we did was the switch

146
00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.800
cam was not ticked, which if I go into here and I go into my multigate, the loop was not

147
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800
ticked.

148
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.200
I can do this loop as well, but call it switch cam for now.

149
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.640
But if we want to tick switch cam, which I'll do in here.

150
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.920
And again, you saw the blending, which was a good example of the camera blending as well.

151
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.080
But if we hit hash, first camera, second camera, third camera, and then back to the start as

152
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.880
well, which is a really nice, powerful functionality.

153
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.680
And then you've also got the start index where, you know, if we wanted to start one, for example,

154
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680
compile and save.

155
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.440
And again, we could have changed that on the actual actor as well.

156
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:43.440
If we hit Alt and P, we hit hash, we can start at a specific part of the chain.

157
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.000
So we're starting here on the second camera, third camera, back to the first one, second

158
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.660
one, et cetera.

159
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.200
So multigates again, pretty powerful functionality.

160
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.040
If you're trying to have multiple outputs, you can start at a specific index and you

161
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.920
can also keep looping through.

162
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.040
And we could add things like re-triggerable inputs where it's just constantly firing.

163
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.080
But hopefully all of these different examples just gave you a good idea about Blueprint

164
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.280
and the functionality that you can have when working inside these tools.
