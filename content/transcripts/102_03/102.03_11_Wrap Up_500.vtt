00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
So, we've covered a lot of ground here today.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.440
We've talked about the introduction to blueprints and the blueprint usage and the flow of blueprints.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.040
We've even jumped in to create our own blueprints and set up some camera switching functionality.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.000
And then we've dove into editor utilities and really gained a little bit more advanced

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.400
functionality especially in regards to working with virtual production and working with our

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.980
precomputed lighting setups and really getting the most out of our scenes to create the most

7
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440
efficient workflows possible.

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.320
So, really hope you found benefit from this course and we'll see you on the next one.
