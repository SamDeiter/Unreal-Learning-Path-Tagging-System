00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go and take a look at the FX Outliner in regards

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.439
to Niagara optimization.

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.439
So let's get started.

4
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.280
Now the FX Outliner is in that debug tool section and is one of the tools that we can

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.359
use to maybe take a look at our scene and kind of see how performance is going.

6
00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.839
Now do you have to use it?

7
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.679
No, you can probably get away with not necessarily using it in your scene.

8
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.600
There are some refresh issues that may occur, especially if you want to catch information

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960
and look at the simulation and see how it's going.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.320
You also will see there's a capture button, but you can also hit that capture button in

11
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.920
the details of the effect itself to instantly capture some of that data.

12
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960
Now it just does a snippet and kind of gives you an overall estimate of what's going on.

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.960
You will see that you can also control the lane of the view, of the playback if you wanted

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960
to.

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.240
You can see the light of it in your view mode.

16
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.520
You can have it descending and us sending order if you need to as well as look at your

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.519
units in milliseconds and seconds if you wanted to or seconds.

18
00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.719
It's up to you.

19
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.040
And then from there you can go into each one of your effects and it grabs all of them all

20
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.120
at one time and you can kind of analyze and see what's going on under the hood.

21
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.400
Let's go ahead and jump into Unreal and we'll take a peek at this.

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.280
Let's go ahead and click on capture.

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.480
That's the tool you will use to capture that session and what's going on.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.200
You see it kind of cleared out what we had before.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.840
And if you do run into any refresh issues, feel free to close the debugger, reopen it

26
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.800
and then run that catch information again or capture, I should say, and then you'll get

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.560
the information you need.

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.320
Again we can control delay.

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.760
You'll see here we have a view mode where we want to see the state performance or debug

30
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.439
overall.

31
00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.000
And again we also have filters where we can go in here and look at our system execution

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.519
state and our emitter execution state.

33
00:01:54.519 --> 00:02:00.359
So if you needed to deactivate these if you wanted to or see what's inactive you can and

34
00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.359
compute them.

35
00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.159
Now again, this is just a quick analyzing tool.

36
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.120
It isn't necessarily perfect.

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.879
You'll see there's a playback, a pause, a loop and a step back and speed and refresh.

38
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.520
So if we open this up, we'll actually see our effect in here and we'll show our different

39
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.880
effects for this class.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.400
You'll see that there's a capture as well as an opening of what is active and what isn't

41
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.640
active.

42
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.800
Now we have this here in our scene and we can choose, you know what, I'm going to go ahead

43
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.879
and take a look at my scene overall.

44
00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.560
I can run a capture here.

45
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.240
Now I may pause the video here because this does a little bit of a hog when it comes to

46
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.080
your simulation.

47
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.760
And just keep that in mind if you are going to capture this information.

48
00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.959
It may be a little bit slow and it may need a little bit of a refresh.

49
00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.399
So I made sure all my arrows are open here so you can see what's going on.

50
00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:58.519
So let's go ahead and run a capture and we'll run a sim.

51
00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.519
There we go.

52
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.199
Now it may take a while for the interface to pop up, but the interface is going to bring

53
00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.159
in another layer of information.

54
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.879
Basically going to break things down for us.

55
00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.879
We'll run a capture again.

56
00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.759
We'll do the sim here.

57
00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.560
And let's see what we get.

58
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.439
Now if it doesn't come up the first time, just hit that sim button one more time and

59
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.840
you should get this here, a pop up, which allows us to be able to actually look at another

60
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.439
win menu, be able to look at all the information for the effect and all the different aspects

61
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.639
of that effect that we have in here.

62
00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.319
And we'll let me know what's going on.

63
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.739
So it just gives you kind of a detailed list of where our effect is, where it's landing,

64
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.340
where you can scroll down and find different modules in here like, oh, hey, we got a control

65
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.820
here for a red, green, and blue.

66
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.659
Do we do anything with this?

67
00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.659
This effect, the milliseconds, how much particles are being pushed through this?

68
00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.100
Is there any extra erroneous stuff I don't need?

69
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.379
So it really just gives you an overall analyzing of your effect and your scene and those sim

70
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.100
and the catch just gets that information and kind of breaks it down for you.

71
00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.699
If for some reason you need to look at that a bit deeper and you can see here all the

72
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.819
information that we have in here, letting us know what's going on.

73
00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.100
Again, these tick boxes are going to give you those categories for each thing that you

74
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.980
want to analyze.

75
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.259
And Unreal is pretty great at being able to categorize things for you.

76
00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.779
And again, it'll tell you if you just float over, if you got what tick box you turned

77
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.980
on, it'll tell you what in context, what this is on the part of that particle.

78
00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.180
That is being looked at.

79
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.500
But be aware, when you hit that capture button, things will come to kind of a crawl.

80
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.900
So be careful.

81
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
Just be patient.

82
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.220
And then again, just give you a snapshot of what's going on in your scene.

83
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.900
And when you run these captures and the Sims, they're really just giving you a spreadsheet.

84
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.379
So again, nothing necessarily to write home about, but can give you the information you

85
00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.379
need.

86
00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.219
And then notice as I click on each one of these effects, I can actually see what's

87
00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:16.740
going on and what I have in place for my settings, what I have active and also what

88
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.699
category is this particular effect.

89
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.060
You can also see is it GPU or is it CPU will also show up.

90
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.339
And then you also like I pointed out before can choose milliseconds, seconds in here if

91
00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.339
you need to.

92
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.339
Now, again, the other ones, which I mentioned earlier also performance, session, browser,

93
00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:40.939
and debug are all kind of in development still.

94
00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.019
So they may not give you exactly what you're looking for.

95
00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.500
Those are evolving, getting faster, stronger.

96
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.219
The most the time when I'm working with this, I'm going to be working with the FX Outliner.

97
00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.179
If that, I will definitely be working with the debug hut.

98
00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:59.699
Now, the debug mode can easily be switched if I need to.

99
00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.019
And I can go from debug mode to state mode.

100
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.099
If I want to, as well as I can go to performance mode and performance gives me a bit of a

101
00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.219
breakdown here.

102
00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:14.740
Let's go and look at the slides at exactly what we're looking at information wise and

103
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.500
how this can possibly help us.

104
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.459
So you can see here we have number one, which is the average total frame time for all effects.

105
00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:28.459
We have number two here, it shows the maximum total frame time for all effects.

106
00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.739
We can also go down or I should say off to the left, go to number three and we'll see

107
00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:38.060
the average per instant cost for this system.

108
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.099
We go to four, you'll see the maximum per instance cost for the system.

109
00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:49.179
We'll see five here, which is the average total cost for all instances of the system.

110
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:54.899
And we go to six where it says maximum total cost of all instances for the system.

111
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:59.019
We'll go to seven here and you'll see the average cost for this instance.

112
00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.019
And then again, we'll see here at eight.

113
00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:04.419
Finally, that is the maximum cost for this instance.

114
00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.459
Now I know that's a lot.

115
00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:10.579
This is why I put it in the slide for you because even I can forget this.

116
00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:15.060
There's a lot of numbers here, but you can now see and see the breakdown of how this

117
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.899
is read and how this can benefit you.

118
00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:23.539
You can kind of see how this is overall going to affect your performance.

119
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.620
You can adjust things, look at things in milliseconds.

120
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.900
I need to tone this down.

121
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.900
This is too much.

122
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.780
So this mainly has to do with a lot of effects.

123
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.780
A lot of times the case in point when to use this is if you have a lot of effects in your

124
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.540
scene and you really need to micromanage them and you really need to somehow get them to

125
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.100
play a lot better with each other in the scene with all the other assets you have in play.

126
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.500
Now remember, there are ways around this and we'll talk about this in the next lecture.

127
00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.459
You can also bake things to, we have a baking method where you can bake it like to a simple

128
00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:01.980
piece of geometry.

129
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.620
The only problem you can run into there is the quality can degrade.

130
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.579
So VDBs are also an option, which I do have a class coming up on that which shows you

131
00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.220
how to use VDBs and also get them in sequencer.

132
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.540
Those are effects, if you're unfamiliar with that, those are effects coming from Houdini

133
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.019
or Maya or Embergen.

134
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.099
You can bring them into Unreal and use them also.

135
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.339
And they are a bit lighter.

136
00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:32.980
It just kind of depends how many you have in your scene, everything within context.

137
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.220
You can break anything if you put too much on it.

138
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.460
But for the most part, they can actually help out if you needed the effect to look pretty

139
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.299
realistic, but not necessarily have a high playback cost.

140
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.019
But again, anything you can put too much on anything and you can bring things to a crawl.

141
00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:54.579
So everything has to be optimized in such a way where your hero objects and effects

142
00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:58.139
are up front and the things that are not that important can be put in the background.

143
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:06.220
Now, we also have the option where if you baked things out into, say, you had Houdini

144
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.860
and you baked it out into an EXR, you can actually import those in.

145
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.579
And I give you a link at the end of this class.

146
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.139
You can put those on a car geometry and you determine whether or how that alpha is going

147
00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.340
to be read, but you can actually put that in the background if you need to.

148
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.419
And that actually is another option to keep things down.

149
00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:29.220
And those can be options definitely explored when it comes to ICV effects or virtual production.

150
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:31.059
That's it with this video.

151
00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:35.460
In the next video, we'll talk about that very same thing about baking your effects and

152
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.779
using the tool in Unreal.

153
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:37.740
Thanks again.
