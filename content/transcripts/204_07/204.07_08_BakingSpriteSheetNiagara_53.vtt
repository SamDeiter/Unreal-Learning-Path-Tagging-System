00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go ahead and grab that sprite sheet, create

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.200
a material for it, and then create a Niagara system and load that material in that system.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.280
So let's get started.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.359
So in here we're going to go ahead and bring in our texture sprite sheet.

5
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.320
Now you can simply just hit the T key and if it's selected you'll notice it will automatically

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
populate.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.079
But for some reason you don't have it in place, you can simply go in here in our content

8
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.439
drawer, have the sprite sheet selected, grab it, and you should be familiar with this,

9
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.079
but if you're not simply click on the arrow and load it this way.

10
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.560
So what we want to do now is build out this material.

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.280
So to build out this material we're going to hit the D key and left click to create the

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280
divide node.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.719
I'm going to pull that RGB string and pull it into the A slot here, and I'm going to

14
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.280
grab the A for the alpha here and pull it into the B slot here.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.239
And then what I can do from here is pull that right into the base color.

16
00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.560
Now you'll notice we're actually not quite doing exactly what we want, right?

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.420
So to help things out, and there's no alpha information being read, we can simply click

18
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.439
on our original node that we have here, the home base where everything gets plugged in,

19
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.680
and we can go in here underneath our blend mode and set that to translucent.

20
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.800
Now we're not done yet because we now need to grab that alpha and pull it into the opacity.

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.800
And you'll see we're going to kind of get a one to one to our original effect.

22
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.360
That's actually pretty cool.

23
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.200
But say you want to have a little bit of glow.

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.840
You'll notice in my original sample it has connected right from our divide into the emissive

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.940
for a little bit of glow, but it does make things a bit lighter.

26
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.840
So if we look into our scene itself, you'll actually see the effect here brighter than

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.440
the one in the distance.

28
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.439
So to be able to control some of that, what you can simply do is go in here and I can

29
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.799
hit the M key and the M key will give us our multiplying.

30
00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.599
And then if I want to hit my finger on the S key left click, and we'll have our scalar

31
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:16.120
and we'll call this emiss one M emissive amounts and plug that into the B channel.

32
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.840
Plug this guy, the divide into the A channel and then grab that and put it into the emissive.

33
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.840
So now if I wanted to increase this, I can create an instance of this material and have

34
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
this exposed so that I can control it.

35
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
Pretty awesome.

36
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.280
But remember, you have to keep in mind what your sprite sheets number of rows are.

37
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.759
And you'll see we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

38
00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.960
And we have an eight by eight square.

39
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.400
That's going to be 64.

40
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.840
And that number is going to be key as we build out our emitter.

41
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.200
Let's go ahead and do that real quick here.

42
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.480
So again, we want to make sure when we build our emitter initially, let's go back to the

43
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.800
FX folder, a little bit less busy.

44
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.920
You can see in the in class effects one, because I didn't change the folder, I kept

45
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.700
it here, all of the individual sprites are rendered out as well as a sprite sheet.

46
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.040
So that can be convenient if you need to take these into Photoshop and edit them later for

47
00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:20.359
whatever reason or make a brand new sprite sheet using a software to be able to do so.

48
00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.840
But we have an already made, so we're okay there.

49
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.319
So I want to go ahead and right click in here and I go to effects.

50
00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.680
And again, I go to Niagara system in this Niagara system, I can hit next, and I can

51
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.639
simply go to an empty slot.

52
00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.799
So you can do emitter or system, but just whatever you choose, make sure it's an empty

53
00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.319
one, and you just hit a plus and then you hit finish and you're in.

54
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.519
Now we have one here that's already set up here, but let me show you again pointing out

55
00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.840
what we have in place.

56
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.479
I made sure that underneath my emitter state, I hit plus and added or I should say update,

57
00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.680
I hit plus and I added my spawn burst instantaneous.

58
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.120
And I kept this spawn count to one and the spawn time to zero.

59
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.039
I left those default and that worked just great.

60
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:13.120
From there, I also want to underneath my particle update, click down the plus arrow, and I added

61
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.319
a sub UV animation.

62
00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.319
Click on this one.

63
00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.680
And we want to make sure that we're using our start frame of zero like I mentioned before,

64
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.079
and end frame is 63 because we want one just behind the next frame.

65
00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:27.639
Very important to consider.

66
00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.120
And then from there, we go to sprite render and under sprite render underneath sub image

67
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.600
size, we change that to eight by eight, like we talked about before.

68
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.360
And finally underneath our initial particle, we want to make sure that our underneath our

69
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.920
sprite attributes, we set the sprite size mode to uniform and then the uniform sprite

70
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.520
size to 500.

71
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.720
This is key so that we actually have the accurate size that we need and it almost does like

72
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720
a one to one.

73
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.199
Now again, you can change the size to whatever you need for your sprite.

74
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.360
So once you're done, you want to go ahead and hit save and then you simply just drag

75
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.860
it into your scene.

76
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.420
This particular one is going straight from the opacity and the emissive.

77
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.460
The opacity is working great, but the emissive is a little bit bright.

78
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.259
So if we decided to revisit this effect, we can go in here and go to its material.

79
00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:26.060
And if we want to hit save, let's see if we'll update this guy is the one that we kind of

80
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.660
were tweaking with.

81
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.060
And then now we can see that it is a bit darker and a little bit closer to what our original

82
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060
is.

83
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.340
Now again, keep in mind you're looping.

84
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.859
So if you do want to use this and this isn't too bad, the resolution isn't too shabby,

85
00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:43.139
especially if it's far away.

86
00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.779
You want to go ahead and edit things accordingly.

87
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.579
So you can also go in here and edit the glow and Photoshop if you want to.

88
00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.739
And there's multiple ways to get this where you want, but this gives you a lower level

89
00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.979
effect that you can put in the background.

90
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.259
Again, you do need to consider how many frames you want, how long it's going to play and

91
00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.459
how long the camera is going to be looking at it.

92
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.939
Now in another way, which I mentioned earlier, and I'll give you a link at the end of this

93
00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:14.779
course, you can also create a plate that you render out to using Houdini or Emberjan or

94
00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:21.060
Maya and it can be an EXR HDR output and UNRUL will accept that in your scene.

95
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.019
Now this isn't part of this course, that course, but I do offer that link to you if you decide

96
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.579
to go that route and you need something even higher resolution wise.

97
00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.539
But this gives you a quick, simple solution versus that EXR one, which gives you even

98
00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:35.539
a higher resolution.

99
00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.740
So you have the best of both worlds to play with things.

100
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.459
Again, all of these steps are laid out for you, such as building the material, making

101
00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.979
sure that it's translucent, and then making sure you're loading the right texture in your

102
00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.180
texture sample node, and then connecting a divide to your opacity emissive.

103
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.500
And also you can connect it to your base color.

104
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.060
But keep in mind, if you connected to your emissive, there could be some brightness there

105
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.660
and kind of just use it the way that I created.

106
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.819
We had a scalar and a multiply and we can downplay that if we need to or increase it

107
00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.819
as needed.

108
00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.660
And then also in the effect itself, some quick review here again, start frame needs to be

109
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.779
set to zero and end frame in the sub UV animation node that you need to make.

110
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:25.540
Make sure you also create a spawn burst instantaneous, keep things at default, and then a sprite

111
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.180
renderer you want to make sure the sub UV size is eight and eight underneath your sub

112
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.260
UV category.

113
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.840
And then finally in that Niagara emitter, or I should say system, you should go in here

114
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.379
underneath your sprite attributes.

115
00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:45.500
And in here you want to control and make sure your uniform sprite size is 500.

116
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.140
By default, the life cycle mode should be system on both scalability and life cycle.

117
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.900
But you can triple check this, especially if you're inheriting an effect that someone else

118
00:07:54.899 --> 00:08:00.659
has created, make sure that the life cycle mode for this particular node is set to system

119
00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:03.620
and it sets a system for both of them.

120
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.120
That's it with this lecture.

121
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.339
Here's some links to help you along your journey to give you more information about what we

122
00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:10.339
talked about.

123
00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:11.339
Thanks again.

124
00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:15.339
And in the next video, we'll do a quick recap about everything that we've learned.
