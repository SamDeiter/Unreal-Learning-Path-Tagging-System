00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go ahead and take a look at some of the debugging

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.080
tools for Niagara as well as some things to consider.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.080
So let's get started.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.599
One of the tools that we have at our disposal is you'll see at the top if you double click

5
00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.199
your effect, a button called performance.

6
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.120
Performance will give us a readout in milliseconds on how each one of the modules that we've created

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120
is performing.

8
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.080
This can be pretty handy to be able to track where you might have some stalls if you've

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.280
made a lot of like really complicated things and they're all starting to pile up or several

10
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.400
different type of effects embedded in your overall effect.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.960
Things could cost if you start to put too much at one particular effect.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.359
So this helps you track that and see how things are performing and how their playback is doing.

13
00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.200
Let's go and jump into Unreal and take a peek.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.799
So here in Unreal we'll see that we have a performance button.

15
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.159
I'm going to go ahead and click on that.

16
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.480
Now this performance button and you'll see the numbers.

17
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.840
If you can't see them a little pro tip here, I can hit control and do the wheel mouse.

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.200
You can actually see these in percentage wise how much they're taking up in our scene.

19
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.439
You'll see an average millisecond calculation on the top there and you'll be able to actually

20
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.399
see what they're doing.

21
00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.560
And again, you'll see it here.

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.239
It says this shows the module runtime cost in percent.

23
00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:31.159
So your overall percentages in here you can track and you can see, well, man, this effect

24
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.079
is really heavy in this area.

25
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.039
This effect is overall I could probably do to the milliseconds that we have going on.

26
00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.319
Maybe slow some things down.

27
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.079
Maybe have too much in here.

28
00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.640
Have a fluid within a fluid.

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.840
One thing I do want to point out though, when you are using fluids, they are pretty heavy

30
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.719
because they are in a GPU effect and you'll see GPU is on here and I'll be referencing

31
00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.079
GPU back and forth.

32
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.840
Now we do have Niagara classes.

33
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.719
This isn't a Niagara class, but this talks about how to control your environment and

34
00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.400
optimize things accordingly.

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.159
So if you want to dive more into Niagara, feel free to do so.

36
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:15.599
But keep in mind, fluids are expensive by nature and sometimes they may not refresh

37
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.599
like you want.

38
00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.319
You can simply just hit pause in the playback and run it again or you could select it and

39
00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.719
sometimes it pops back into view.

40
00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.240
Certain gas fluids may have a little bit of a refresh issue, but overall, especially if

41
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.199
you're pairing them with other effects like maybe there's a gas nested within another

42
00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.199
effect.

43
00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.639
So these are just things to consider when working with your effects overall.

44
00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.879
You'll see the three dot button here right next to the performance button.

45
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.400
You'll be able to pull down and see the GPU profiling, display average, display maximum

46
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.079
if we turn that on, and you'll also see display relative values as well as display absolute

47
00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.079
values.

48
00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.840
So you have a bit of options here.

49
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.159
Another tool we have for debugging is the literal debug tool.

50
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.000
Now we'll break down a few other aspects of it too.

51
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.240
It is evolving, getting better, stronger, faster, but we're going to be looking at some of the

52
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.520
primary tools that we can use for optimization.

53
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.320
To be able to activate it, you can go to three different areas.

54
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.719
One, you can go into the details of that effect if you're selecting that in your editor.

55
00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:29.080
Two, you can go to the tools pull down menu and go to debug and go to Niagara debugger.

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.320
And three, if you go into your effect itself and double click it, you'll be able to see

57
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.879
debug right next to that performance button nearby.

58
00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.639
Let's go ahead and jump into Unreal and take a look at a few things.

59
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:49.000
So if I want to, I can run the performance in here showing my overall what's going on

60
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.840
with our effect and those percentages.

61
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.240
And I can also run the debug at the same time if I wish.

62
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.319
But I'm going to save a little bit of overhead and I'm going to turn that performance off.

63
00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.159
Now that performance is not dependent upon whether we're playing in the viewer here.

64
00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.319
We can actually hit pause and you'll see your percentages still running.

65
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.799
So I'm going to go and click on performance and turn that off.

66
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.039
I'm going to go and click on that debug here and you'll see it says debug hut.

67
00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.959
You also have the option to look at the FX outliner, which we'll look at later.

68
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.120
And there's also an attribute spreadsheet.

69
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.519
Let's go ahead and take a look at the debug hut.

70
00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:31.039
Now when we open up this debug hug, like I said before, you can get to it two different

71
00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.620
ways, three different ways.

72
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.100
So we have tools, debug, now agro debugger, or selecting the effect in your environment.

73
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.980
You can simply just click on debug.

74
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.300
You can also capture some data, which is kind of connected, which you can also do with the

75
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.379
FX outliner.

76
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.660
Let's go and take a look at this debugger.

77
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.220
Now in the debugger, we want to be able to turn on our debug, HUD enabled.

78
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.620
There should be on by default.

79
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.100
You also want to turn on your debug, HUD rendering enabled.

80
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.340
This will give you some text, but also it will show you your overall little outline here

81
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.340
that we have for a scene.

82
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.100
We want to be able to actually see our little bounce.

83
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.980
This is important and isn't always on by default, but you can actually help that by clicking

84
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.980
this on.

85
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.379
You'll see it'll actually turn on for us.

86
00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.860
So we also want to have a validate system simulation data buffers.

87
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.500
You can turn that on.

88
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500
But these are optional.

89
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.980
You don't necessarily have to have all these on, such as validate particle data buffers,

90
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.740
validate particle system simulation data buffers, as well as validate log errors.

91
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.899
This is just a little secondary checkbox that allows you to double check your work and see

92
00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.459
if things are doing what their intentions are.

93
00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:52.139
So I'm going to go and turn these off for now.

94
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.100
We should be okay without them, but the options are there.

95
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.939
At any time you're unsure what something does, simply float over that effect and Unreal will

96
00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.060
give you some pro tips.

97
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.219
These are very helpful.

98
00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.860
These do have impact on performance.

99
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.219
I do want to mention that.

100
00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.939
So note to self.

101
00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.699
We have a debug overview enabled.

102
00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.779
Turn that on.

103
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.540
And this will give us an overlay of what's going on in milliseconds for that particular

104
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.860
effect.

105
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.180
You'll also see include cascade.

106
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.420
So if you're grabbing something from the marketplace, that's a bit older and includes cascade.

107
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.620
You can do so.

108
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.220
But there's a Python script you can use to be able to convert those cascades into Niagara.

109
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.379
You have to just turn it on into your plugins.

110
00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.340
But keep in mind when you do that, there's some editing that may be involved.

111
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.819
So let's go ahead and take a look at the debug overview mode.

112
00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.699
You'll see we have GPU compute performance in here.

113
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.139
But by default, we can have the overview here.

114
00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.860
And it shows us our total particles that were pushing.

115
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.459
Now it also shows us our memory.

116
00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.859
And it also shows us our total emitters here.

117
00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:03.859
I'll pulse my cursor so you can actually see where I'm at.

118
00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.019
We can go over here too and choose scalability.

119
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:12.539
This will give us another overview, looking at all the content that we have going on.

120
00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.620
Next we can do performance.

121
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.819
And again, this will show us the data that we need.

122
00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:26.379
It'll show us what's going on on an average RT and also our general playback here in milliseconds

123
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.819
and also what we're pushing.

124
00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:33.899
Again, you'll see the game thread, max on this particular one, and game thread average here.

125
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:38.860
And we've talked about game thread in previous classes.

126
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.500
Next we can go in here and choose performance graph.

127
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.860
Now this performance graph is going to give us a readout and show us where things are

128
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.659
spiking in here.

129
00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:52.860
And these tools are really helpful, especially if you have a lot of effects in the scene.

130
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.339
So you've got to keep that in mind.

131
00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:59.539
Also note to self, if you have fluids, fluids are a bit more expensive.

132
00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:04.500
For again, they are GPU, they're running some GPU processes here.

133
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.459
And the higher or the more advanced they are and lots of different effects nested inside

134
00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:18.620
of them, you've got to keep in mind that what they're going to cost, especially with several.

135
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.139
We can then choose also GPU compute performance again.

136
00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:23.139
Go back to where we were.

137
00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:24.939
And it gives us a big overlay.

138
00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.300
Let me move this down so you can see it here and shows our average instances, average use

139
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.740
here or US, I should say, and max US.

140
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
Now you'll look at this in context.

141
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.019
You can see them all categorized here.

142
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:45.100
So we have compute curl, scattered particles, pre-sim velocity, sourcing.

143
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.100
So it's kind of peeling back the onion of all the effects that were working and some

144
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.820
of the modules that we have active within our effect.

145
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.700
As you look in the menu, as we scroll down, you have several options for viewing as well

146
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.340
as you'll be able to change some of the positioning and the font.

147
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.180
You'll see there's a font control here.

148
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.740
And if we scroll down even more, we can actually see there's a debug filter.

149
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.060
You can actually choose what system you're looking at.

150
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.060
Simply what I like to do is just deselect it, select it and then run the debug again.

151
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.900
Otherwise, if you load that filter, make sure you're not confused on what you have in place.

152
00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:25.659
And that can happen, especially if you're working late at night.

153
00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:28.139
But I like to simply just click and re-click again.

154
00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:30.340
And it's pretty easy to do so.

155
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.579
You'll see there's a debug system here where you actually can look at verbose and just

156
00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:37.419
gives you a little bit more information.

157
00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:39.139
You'll see I got verbose here on.

158
00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:42.699
We'll just do basic on this one if you want to basic.

159
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:45.360
And it's just looking at the system overall.

160
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.220
So you have a little bit of quality control in here too.

161
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.139
So if I went in here, you'll see there's system attributes.

162
00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:54.819
If I hit a plus here, I'll be able to select what I want here.

163
00:09:54.819 --> 00:10:00.299
Do I want to, let's go and open this up here, go and add an array for this system attribute.

164
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.559
And let me show you what I mean.

165
00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:08.600
If I typed in system, it's basically like a tag area.

166
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.299
This would actually match all system processes to that particular region.

167
00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:16.860
So it's almost like adding another slot in here and you'll see it real give you a quick

168
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.620
rundown for that.

169
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.580
So there's some advanced stuff and stuff you may not even touch.

170
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.220
I rarely will touch this one because I know that I don't really need it.

171
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.740
Everything that I try to build, I try to build clean in the system itself.

172
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.000
You'll also see that you have a font control, like we said before, but even here you can

173
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.460
move it and shift it if you needed to.

174
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.340
You'll notice there's debug particles here where actually we have a few more things we

175
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.820
can do such as there's tech more text options.

176
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.259
You can actually show your particle index if you need to.

177
00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:50.580
There's quite a bit that we can play with.

178
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580
It's really up to you.

179
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.460
And again, it's like a case by case.

180
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.220
I don't want to get too much into buttonology, but I want to talk mainly on the stuff that

181
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.419
I would be playing with and working with.

182
00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:01.539
You'll see there's a perf overview here.

183
00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:07.620
We can actually can control our preferences here for reporting your frames and you're also

184
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.340
samples mode, your frame total if you want to take a look at that.

185
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.539
And we also, if we scroll down just a little bit more, you can control the color of the

186
00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:21.019
overall kind of testing of your look and feel for your object here.

187
00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:24.659
And also, let me see here.

188
00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.699
You'll also see there's a show global budget info right here.

189
00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:31.899
And you'll see that pop up towards the bottom.

190
00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:37.740
And let's go and turn this off for now.

191
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.659
So if we scroll up a little bit, you'll notice we also have an area called particle attributes.

192
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.219
This is under the debug particles.

193
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.700
Now I can add systems in here if I wanted to, but this is not typical for me personally.

194
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.700
I like to do it where I can track it a little bit better within the effect itself.

195
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.660
Again, let's go ahead and look at a quick review here at the interface.

196
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.820
We have Niagara debugger panel.

197
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.379
We have the playback options.

198
00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:05.940
And we have the debugger tabs.

199
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.060
Each one of these are set up so that you can control the speed if you wanted to.

200
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.940
And take a look what you need to.

201
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:19.220
Now, when I say take a look, we want to focus mainly on the debug HUD and the FX Outliner.

202
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:25.020
Performance session browser and debug spawn are all experimental and they may not perform

203
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.980
exactly like you want.

204
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.380
So the main ones you want to focus on are these two, the debug HUD and the FX Outliner.

205
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.180
They're a bit more stable right now in their current version.

206
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.420
So just keep that in mind.

207
00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:45.459
Again, key points I want to iterate here is again, we have the debug HUD enabled and

208
00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:47.899
also the debug overview enabled.

209
00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:52.379
This will give us what we need to be able to bring things onto the screen.

210
00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:58.860
And again, under debug overview, you can analyze visually the output such as the GPU compute

211
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.779
performance and the overall performance.

212
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:08.179
Let's go and take a look at some things we can do on screen, such as look at our particle

213
00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:09.419
perf.

214
00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:13.819
This is basically looking at what's going on under the hood and how the frames per second

215
00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:16.899
and the averages are working in our scene.

216
00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:20.019
So what we'll do here is close the debugger.

217
00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:24.299
With that on or with that off, I should say, you'll see that stuff that we had on screen

218
00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.699
go away.

219
00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:32.379
Let's go to our stats and in our stats, we'll look at engine and we'll look at the particle

220
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:33.819
preferences here.

221
00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:37.059
Again, this is going to give us an overlay on our screen.

222
00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:41.259
Now for running some problems, you can squeeze in your menus a bit.

223
00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:47.779
You can actually see those full run of those numbers and see how things are performing

224
00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:51.500
with our frames in our scene.

225
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.139
Another one we can run under stat Niagara, we can turn on Niagara baselines.

226
00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:58.139
Let's do that.

227
00:13:58.139 --> 00:13:59.859
So let's do that same thing.

228
00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:04.019
We'll go under stat Niagara and Niagara baselines.

229
00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:07.379
Now if it doesn't turn on automatically, just move your camera a little bit and it should

230
00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.860
show up.

231
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.860
It sometimes is a little bit refreshed.

232
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.860
There it goes.

233
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.819
It's popped in and it's now decided to give us our information.

234
00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:22.220
Now that particular system is used if you're going in here and it's a class for baseline

235
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.860
controllers and these can be or are responsible for spawning and manipulating the effect needed

236
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.939
for the baseline perf tests.

237
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.540
Now if you're a little bit more into programming to effects, you would understand where that

238
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.540
might be needed.

239
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.740
Now we're not going to jump into that.

240
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.820
I'm not going to run you through Python, Gambit here or a bit of C++ but overall you

241
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.420
can use these as a comparable if you turn them on on your screen.

242
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.820
And you'll notice we don't have anything right now to compare things to.

243
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.340
Another way to optimize your scene is to go in here and if your effect doesn't need to

244
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.460
move around, you can turn off require current frame data.

245
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.580
So this can save a little bit of overhead.

246
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.019
But again, if your effect doesn't need to move, you can turn this off.

247
00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:14.120
This can help a little bit of the overall, especially if you have several that are kind

248
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.259
of complicated, but they're not really going to move.

249
00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:19.420
There's no that extra calculation isn't really needed.

250
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.740
Now Unreal in aggregate slimmer, faster, stronger.

251
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.620
So and your machines may be really spot on.

252
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.580
You may not need to do this, but in other cases, it might help a little bit.

253
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.460
All of the stuff that we talked about so far in looking at the debug hub or HUD, I should

254
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.379
say, heads up display, you can actually run them via a console command.

255
00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:45.659
And here are all the console commands that have listed in the lecture if you want to

256
00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:46.659
reference them.

257
00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:49.259
Obviously, you don't want to load them all.

258
00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:54.779
You actually can do all of these through the menu, but these are options in here.

259
00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:59.220
Here's a few more that can help you with playback if you wanted to control some of that.

260
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.539
So the first one here will play all simulations.

261
00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:07.980
You'll see FX Niagara dot debug playback mode one will pause the simulation and FX Niagara

262
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.779
dot debug dot playback mode two will step single frames and then pause all simulations.

263
00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:19.220
Now you can also do that within the Delta tick inside of the effect itself, but you

264
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.980
can also do it here through their playback mode.

265
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.860
FX dot Niagara dot debug playback rate.

266
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:30.139
You can also control that as well as FX dot Niagara debug playback rate 0.1.

267
00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.980
If you want to run all simulations at half the speed.

268
00:16:33.539 --> 00:16:36.659
So I'm not going to go through all of these, but these are all available to be able to

269
00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:40.620
see and be able to tweak and edit things if you needed to.

270
00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:46.379
If you wanted to check your speed, check your thread count and et cetera, as well as your budget.

271
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.940
That's it with this lecture.

272
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.420
In the next lecture, we're going to take a look at FX Outliner breakdown.
