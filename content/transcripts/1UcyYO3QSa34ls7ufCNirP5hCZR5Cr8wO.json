So we can do a number of things to restrict the placement of foliage. In the advanced section here, which you can see highlighted, you can define the landscape layers and this foliage should be allowed on or not. So do you want to just place the foliage on specific layers, either add them to the inclusion layers or the exclusion layers and this will give you much more control of where you are placing the foliage. You can also adjust the ground slope angle to restrict the slope at which the foliage will be placed. So that's always worth knowing. And then also when we're looking at the landscape grass, the grass tool can be used to mask and adjust the placement or you can just disable the setting like the placement jitter to make something that looks like a field of crops. So, I mean, you can get some really, really nice results by actually using these tools to create something a bit more uniform if that's something that you want in your project. So when used with the foliage tools, the grass tools are really, really powerful. So worth considering those as well. So to close out here, we've covered foliage tools, the settings and the types, talked a little bit about LOD and hopefully giving you some cool tips and tricks there at the end on your foliage settings. So let's go and close out the video.",
