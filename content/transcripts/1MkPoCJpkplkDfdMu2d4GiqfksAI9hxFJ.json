  "text": " Now we all know what saving a game means, it's the underlying functionality that allows a player to save the current state of the game, close it and come back and resume where they left off. But what really constitutes a current state of the game is really going to vary from project to project. Thankfully Unreal offers a flexible save system that allows us to store a plethora of information about the game and also allows the player to have multiple saves for this particular game in different slots. So really the main question is how extensive do you need your save game to be? Saving and loading a game can both be done in native C++ and also in blueprint and it's important to note that whilst both methods offer a synchronous and asynchronous way of saving and loading, the native C++ also offers explicit synchronous binary saving and loading methods. Saving and loading a game in either native or blueprint follow a very similar flow and set of steps. For the purposes of this talk we'll be talking about them in very general terms, however the Unreal Engine documentation has got a great example of how you can achieve both loading and saving either synchronously or asynchronously. First thing we need to do is create a new save game object. In native C++ this would be done by creating a new class that inherits from the use save game type. In blueprint we can create a new blueprint class then select the save game parent class to base our new blueprint from. Next we need to choose what data we wish to store in our save game. For example we may need to store the last known location and rotation of the player. In this case we would declare two new variables of F vector and F rotator types. Alongside the data that you wish to store we also need to define two key pieces of information that will allow us to save and load our save data. The first is just a string that represents the save slot name and the second is an integer that signifies the save game index. The gameplay statics library provides three key functions to both native and blueprint that allow us to save and load our game and those are the create save game object. This function takes in a class for your save game. This will be the class of your new save game object and this function will return you that newly created save game object directly. Next we have the save game to slot and async save game to slot. These functions require the following data to save your game. That would be the save game object itself, the save game slot name and lastly the save game index. Lastly we have the load game from slot and the asynchronous load game from slot. These functions require both the slot name and the index in order to retrieve the save game object that holds your save data. It really is important to note that it's advised that you make use of the asynchronous versions of the save game and load game functions to avoid any hitches on your game thread. Furthermore the asynchronous version will provide a callback function which not only return the save game object but will also let us know whether or not the procedure was successful or not.",
