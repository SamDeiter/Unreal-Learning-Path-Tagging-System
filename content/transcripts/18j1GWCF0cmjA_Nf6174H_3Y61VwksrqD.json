  "text": " Before we start to use the clothing tool itself, I'd like to quickly go over some of the tools features and what the tool looks like so that we have a better idea of its functionality once we start to use it in the editor. So first off, when we open up the tool, at the top we're going to have our clothing data. Now this is going to be where all of the meshes that we want to have some type of clothing effect are added. When we select one of them, underneath that we're going to have masks and our masks can do actually a lot of different things. We have one called max distance, which is the maximum distance any point on the cloth can move from its animated position and this is going to be the most common property that you need for your cloth to be interactive throughout the world. There is backstop distance, backstop radius, anim drive stiffness, anim drive dampening, tether sniff dis, tether scale, drag lift, edge stiffness, bending sniff diff, area sniff dis, buckling stiffness, and pressure. All of these have a slightly different yet useful effect on the way the cloth is going to react to things around it in the world. However, one setting isn't necessarily going to fix cloth or make something happen or make something not happen. It's going to be a collection of different settings and there's going to be no one magic bullet. But the best thing about this tool is it is very easy to add multiple masks and adjust their settings so that we can test things out very quickly without having to worry about going back to our DCC or anything like that. So if you are having something, maybe you need to add a little lift or a little drag, but you're not sure how much you can always paint that in and it's very easy to add that data and delete that data. Next, we have under our config, we have our chaos clothing config and our chaos clothing shared simulation config. So the top basically is the settings for our simulation on this piece of cloth and the bottom are settings for how cloth is going to react as a whole throughout our entire project. So we're going to mainly focus on the top sections. The bottom section is a little bit more advanced and be careful adjusting it because it will have an effect on cloth throughout your entire project. So let's look at the top and what it is broken down into. So we have first up our mass properties. This controls the mass or the density of the cloth material. So if we increase this number, we're going to make it more dense. If we decrease it, we're going to make it lighter. So think very heavy cloth or leather might have a value that is closer to one while some thing like silk or maybe a little a doily or something like that might have a value of point zero zero zero one. Also, for these particular values, no matter what value you are entering here, smaller values are always better. So multiple decimal points, it's going to give you a much better result. So instead of using point one, try point one, two, five, six. Underneath that, we have our material properties. No, I already went over that. No material properties adjust the stiffness of the cloth material. So there we go. We have our edge stiffness, our bending stiffness using bending elements and our area stiffness. Now, again, the great thing about this is I can adjust these and see it real time happening in the editor. So there is nothing necessarily set that cloth needs to apply to these. One doesn't necessarily mean anything other than full zero means completely off. So you have that entire decimal range to work with. Long range attachment deals with how the solver reacts when iteration count is low and it's used to help prevent stretching. Our collision properties adjust how the cloth will collide with itself. And our animation properties controls how animation either affects the cloth or reacts to the cloth's animation. Our environment properties control how the cloth simulation reacts with things in the environment. And then our simulation, the last one, that increases the number of steps, increasing the resolution, making the cloth react more lifelike. However, doing that will take more resources. So by adjusting that, we are actually going to make this less performant. Now, one of the other cool things that we can do with our cloth and the other masks that we talked about in the beginning is we have the ability to paint them using different tools. We have a gradient, a brush, a smooth and a fill. You can also bring in and use gradients or fills that you've created inside of a digital content creation program and stored in the red, green or blue vertex color. So that's right. You can use vertex color information that's already been created. If you are, say, making a cape and you know exactly where you want the cloth to be and you've already set that up and painted it in your DCC, you can bring that over and set that up. If not, you can do it inside of Unreal. Now our brush is going to allow us to just paint all of the vertices at a given value. So this is really good if we know that the entire thing needs to be cloth or there's going to be a large area that's cloth or we want to just specify a little bit of an area to paint. We can do that. Our gradient gives us the ability to have a gradient so we can do a gradient between and no cloth or active cloth and semi active cloth and then have values assigned that go from say zero to one or zero to 100 depending on the value that we want for its effect. And the gradient will apply a gradient value starting at zero and then as it goes along the cloth, it'll do a value one, two, so on and so on until it reaches whatever our ending value is. And this gives us some really great cloth reaction. And you'll see we're going to actually use gradient for our example here. Smooth allows us to smooth the area out. So let's say that we are painting something and we notice that the edges or the transition is harsh. We can use the smoothing tool to actually smooth that transition out allowing us to have a better transition between areas that either have cloth or don't have cloth or areas that go between a very, very flexible cloth, maybe not so flexible cloth. Last but not least, we have the fill and this allows us to quickly fill an entire area of cloth. This is really good if you have maybe say multiple cloth panels on something and you need to just quickly make sure that they all have a certain cloth setting. You can go in there and just click on them with the fill tool, fill them all in. You don't have to worry about painting or adding a gradient. So with that done, this is going to wrap up our chaos clothing workflows and tool overview. In the next part of this tutorial, we are going to get started with our chaos clothing exercise. So make sure you have Unreal Engine 5 started and ready to go and I'll see you in just a bit.",
