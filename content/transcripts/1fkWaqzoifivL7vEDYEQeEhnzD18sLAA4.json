  "text": " In this video, we're going to walk through how to package this project into an executable. After we make all the changes, let's just quickly reveal what we did during the hands-on exercise. We added one more event here called send string and integer is an OSC message that has a string and also an integer. We also have a send string bundle event here, which is sending a bundle of two messages, both contain one string value inside. And finally, we make sure that our logic is able to work in both ways communication. In the sender, we're specifying the OSC message target based on if it's a sender or a receiver. Also, are making sure the sender also have a server to listen to the OSC messages and we react the same way as the receiver from here. And finally, we made sure we connect back to the read launch parameter events here. So we are getting the information from the launch parameter. Okay, now we just need to go to platform and hit Windows and package. Before that, let's go to the package settings and see what are the couple of settings we want to confirm. So inside project, let's first go to maps and mode and make sure that the game default map, which will be the first map that we will open into in the packaged game, is the correct map we wanted to use. In our case, it should be OSC example. And it is using a game mode we wanted to use. We didn't do anything in the game instance, so it's okay to remain in the default game instance here. So now this part all looks good. I'm going to go to the packaging part. In the packaging part, we can kind of go past everything here. We didn't do anything special in this part. We will open the advanced tab. Let's move on to cook only maps. So this is a good practice to check this. So it will only cook the map we want to cook and ignore everything else. It will be a good way to reduce the package size to have this checked. So once we checked this, we want to make sure we have the list of maps we want to include in a packaged build. So in our case, it's simple because we only have one map. It's the default map we are opening to. So by default, this map will already be included in our packaging list. But just as a good practice, we can make sure we also list it in our list of maps to include. So we can add a map by pressing this plus button. We can use a three dot button here to find the map we want to include, which will be in the content folder. This one, open. Now we don't need to worry about everything, anything else. And for the build configuration, because I want to continue to see the print string, I will say I will leave it as a development build. If you are running to any weird issue, you might need to do a full rebuild, but I'm going to not do a full rebuild just to speed things up. And if we do it for distribution check, this will by default change back to be a shipping build. We're not going to distribute this anywhere, so I'm going to uncheck it and go back to development. So that should be it. We can now go ahead, go to platforms, go to Windows and hit package project. We can specify where we want it to package. I'll put it into packaged and say this will be my result. I'll hit select folder to start packaging. In the next video, we will show you the final result from this packaged project and walk through some of the launch parameter settings.",
