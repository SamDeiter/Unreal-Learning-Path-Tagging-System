  "text": " So first let's talk about working with Cine Camera Actors. So what is a Cine Camera Actor? Well in UE5 it's a camera that emulates a real camera. So it's not entirely unlike a game camera, but it's got some film controls in there. So we can change the film back settings, lens, focus and also tracking, which is available for other cameras, but tracking is a great option for this camera as well. And then if we talk about in detail what these settings mean, we can change the aspect ratio. So you can see that we've got the film back settings in the middle here where you can edit the sensor width and height. And you can just access these by clicking the Cine Camera Actor in the level. Once you select the Cine Camera Actor, it'll have this highlight here on the top component and components are going to be something we get into in a few minutes here. But then you'll see the film back settings here. We've also got lens settings where we can set the f-stop and the focal length. And then also we've got focus settings, which you can select between manual focus and so we can track the focus very specifically within something called sequencer, which again we'll be talking about in a little while here. Or you can actually track actors with focus as well. So if you want to track a specific element of your scene, you can also just automatically track that. So there's a few different focus settings, which we'll also be getting into. And then also the look at tracking, which is what I'm referring to there, which is specific actor tracking. So you've got how to doc here. If you'd like to know anything more about Cine Camera Actors, it has a bit of a deep dive and you can find all the details on that link there. With Cine Camera Actors, this is a tool that we call Sequencer. And we'll talk about Sequencer in a little while here, but what you can see is you can see that we've added a camera, which is the Shot Cam 0010 here, and we've added this to the Sequencer. Again, we'll be talking about exactly how to do this in a little while. It's just to give you more of an overview here. So we're adding a camera and we can also create camera cuts. This is our timeline area here and we can say that we're looking at Shot Cam 0010 and if frame 147 for whatever reason, we wanted to add a camera cut in there, we could create a camera cut and that would show almost the layout of the master sequence. We can also set camera bindings. So if we wanted to bind a certain event or action to a specific camera shot or movement, we could do that as well. And also you can add keyframes. So you can track transforms here. You can set focus in the Sequencer as well. You can even edit the focal length if you've got a min and max focal length that are two different focal lengths, you can track the focal length. Any editable property for the most part in Unreal Engine, you can edit within Sequencer and you'll see a little Sequencer keys pop up in the details panel of those actors for properties that you can edit in a camera. And then just to touch upon a couple of different variations here that are useful to know about. So we've got a scene capture component 2D, which is used to capture a snapshot of the scene from a single plane and feed it into a render target. So it's essentially just getting a render snapshot of the view that you're currently seeing. And we've got a few cool tricks here that we can use to use these in a really interesting which again, we'll be getting into in this course today. And then we've also got a virtual camera 2 actor, which is used to transmit camera motion and control setting remotely through Live Link. So if you're using any kind of motion matching, you'll likely be using this virtual camera 2 actor. So all these things are just very high level to get you started and familiar with working with camera actors. And we'll be deep diving into these throughout this course today. Thanks for watching.",
