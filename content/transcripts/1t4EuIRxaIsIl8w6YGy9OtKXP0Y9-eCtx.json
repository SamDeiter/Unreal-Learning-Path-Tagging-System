  "text": " We're back to our zombie walk, where we're going to cover the layered blend per bone node. Now, the layered blend per bone node will give us control over our animation or rather multiple animations will be able to blend certain areas or let's say where the upper body we wish to control via the animation. We could blend other information like a mocap type of thing into that animation. So we can get some really great effects of what we're looking for. So we're going to go ahead and hop right back into the engine here. So let's go ahead and alt tab to our animation blueprint. Now there are some known visual bugs in 5.3 and some previous versions that will be taken care of and later versions. But one of those is this node debug, for example. Now typically you want to look for the preview instance as a override when you're trying to connect your animations. But we'll get to that here in a sec. So the first thing we want to do is we want to create our layered bone. Spelling is important. Layered blend per node bone. There it is. Okay. We're going to head in and hook that up here. And the first thing is we're going to hook up our creep animation. And I know that the fall loop has the hands flaring up around. So it kind of gives it a little bit of that for that zombie look. So I know I'm going to go ahead and hook that up to the blend pose. But if I hit compile and save, nothing's really happening, right? Even though we have the blend weight at one, the reason is we have to now tell it what bones we wish to control. Okay. So we know that again, that the arms are going to be really flaring out. So we want to go ahead and add the control, which is over here in your details on this node or the array elements. So right now it doesn't show anything. So we have to add that by clicking a plus. Coming down here, we have to tell it in this case, we want to control the upper arm area. So where will we start? Well, I just, this works great. I say we start with a clavicle. Make sure you spell that correctly. Clavicle underscore R or R and go ahead, compile and save and we get it. If you don't get a pop there, that could mean you missed typed it. So you can come over to the skeleton tree and look for the spelling of what it is. Otherwise you should be good to go. Now to duplicate this on the other side, we're going to need to add another array element. So I want to collapse that and I'm going to hit the plus and it always says members. That doesn't mean that there's other things you have to add. These are already pre designated with the members, in this case, bone name and blend death. But I want to go ahead and duplicate what I did there. And spelling is important. Or left or L going to hit compile and save. And there we go. We've got our zombie walk. Sort of right. It's almost there. Really is almost there. So to show you another control that we can have onto it, let's say we want to add the run forward because the head kind of bounces around a little bit, right? So right now you couldn't do that. Fortunately, we have an add pin so we wouldn't add the blending here under this index for this. We need to create another index. So to do that, your add pin, you'll notice we get the other additional adding here. Right. So go ahead and drag the M M run forward into that blend pose. And then we have to tell it because again, if you hit compile and save, there is no we're not telling it what to do yet. OK, so we need to add our array element under the two members. Go ahead and look for I'm going to say the neck underscore zero one. It seems to be a pretty good control over that. Yes, I'll go ahead and get that. It compile, save and eyes chopping at the bit. Right. The zombie is got the bouncy head. That looks great. OK, again, these are taking existing animations merely and blending them together and basing everything on what we know. Now we could record and we could call it the zombie walk. So let's go ahead and do that. You recall, we can do this right here with the record button. And we're going to name it. Let's go ahead and call it Mr. Zombie Walk. OK, and underscore and as I say, we always make sure we put our anim at the end. And we're going to leave everything else by default, but let's put it in the class animations folder and hit OK. I'm going to go for about four seconds. That's what we really need. That's plenty. And open up to test it. Bring that over here and dock it. And it looks great. We have exactly what we want. And now you you could change the preview, but we're going to keep it right here with the Quinn just to see that it is working. Excellent. All right. So now you can play around with this some more and, you know, animate it further and sequence or if you wish. But I think I'm pretty happy with this. I'm going to just go ahead and hit save and close out this animator. And we're going to now jump into another part of the engine, which is called our state machines.",
