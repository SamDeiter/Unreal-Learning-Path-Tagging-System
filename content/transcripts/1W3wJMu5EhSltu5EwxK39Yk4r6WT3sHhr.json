  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to look at editing assets, but we're going to first focus on construction blueprints before we go and tackle the others. Let's get started. If you're unfamiliar with blueprints, construction blueprints allow you to build and assemble things pretty quickly, and it does it quite well. They were first on the scene before PCG, but nothing can stop you from adding and putting those together. To be able to get these particular blueprints, which I'll be pointing out, you want to go to three different projects in the Marketplace. You'll find it under Marketplace, Free Assets, Megascans. The ones you want to look at are Dry Grass Collections, Quarry Collections, and Lava Field Collections. The one that has all three because the others may have just a few is Quarry Collections. Let's go ahead and take a look at those blueprints, what they are, and then jump into Unreal, and I'll show you a little bit of how they work. The three blueprints you're going to get is going to be Quixel Random Scatter, Quixel Spline Scatter, and Quixel Spline Wall Align. Wall Align allows you to build like a wall of rock, or you can do a ridge line, whatever you need and want, you can put in there and you'll see what I mean in just a second. There's also Quixel Spline Scatter and also Random Scatter. These are the two we'll look at primarily in this class. Let's go to Unreal and take a peek. In Unreal, we'll see here we have a Spline Scatter in place here. This particular one is built on a spline, and with it selected, I can actually adjust the spline. You'll see with it selected, a spline curve show up. I can click on these points, and these points will allow me to change the shape of this spline, and then the assets will populate. This can also mean of me stretching and pulling as I need. Let's grab the other end of the spline, you'll see what I'm talking about. As I move this around, you'll see these pieces start to shrink or increase in the scene, and I've put quite a few in here. Let's go and move this back, and you'll see them disappear or populate based on the positioning of the spline. Now, they're not as robust as PCGs, just note to yourself, because PCGs allow you to even have things such as avoid assets crossing over with each other. There's a pruning you can do, there's a lot more robust logic involved, but the Blueprints are pretty straightforward, and it doesn't mean you can't use them together. In this particular Blueprint, you'll see a Select Meshes area. This is where you can add your meshes, as many as you need. There's an Add element here. Now, obviously, like anything else, you can bloat things pretty quickly. It is instancing these in the Blueprint. If you have a whole lot, try to be a little bit more deterministic and try to only put in there what you need. You'll see there's additional transforms that you can control. There's the nodes which actually show those assets being contained and sorted in Unreal. But that is not where you would load your assets. You want to load them here under Select Mesh. There's a random stream here, so you can actually control the seed of these if you needed to. Now, I did this, I slid across here, you're going to see it populate. It might take a little bit of time. So you can control how many show up. It does a little randomness there. I shouldn't say so much controlling how many, more of the randomness here for initial seed. So you have some control here as well as additional transforms. All this is at your fingertips. You can bake it to the level once you've committed to what you need and want. It is there mainly to make things a bit lighter. Now, there's another Blueprint if we go to my Content Browser, and this will be included with your files. There's a one called Random Scatter. If I bring that Blueprint into our scene, we can now see that we have the ability to add some meshes. So I go to Edit, Add a Mesh. I can just type in maybe seed or tree. We can grab a tree here. We will do this broken assembly. Same one we had before. If we want to, we can add another mesh in here. Let's see if we can grab some rocks. Now again, this isn't as robust as we'll do mossy rocks as a PCG because they're going to kind of be sandwiched on each other until we start moving things around. And if we want to, we could add something else in here. Now, rocks is kind of going to be overblown on this. If I move this, it's supposed to be randomized. But we can sort through some of this. We can Control Radius if we want to. We can Control Number of Meshes. And as you move them around, you can actually rotate these and then make it look like a brand new mesh, believe it or not. Looks like a strange fortress. So these just add to your plethora of tools when it comes to building your environment. And you can also see like minimum scale if you wanted to tweak things out. You can see that you can make it look really funky. Got to be careful though, could get some stretching. You can mess with the randomness if you wanted to, local randomness, so that each pile doesn't quite look the same. So there's a lot of power at your fingertips to be able to customize these. And this is why they were made, so that you can actually add to your scene pretty quickly and get up and running. And again, you can also bake the level. That's about it with this lesson. In the next lesson, we're going to take a quick look at PCGs and how they use them in your environment. Thanks again.",
