So we want to open an app, we want the user to see a picture and a button, we'll press a button, some rain sound plays, and then the user presses another button and the rain pauses. We'll need the Sleepy Time rain assets for this. They're not so project specific, you can't import your own, but just if you wanted to follow along one for one, you'd need those assets. And also the new project creation, we're going to start with a blank project inside of the games folder, and we'll have Blueprint selected. And then importantly, our target mobile platform will be mobile. If you already have a project open and you didn't have this selected, you can still edit all the parameters inside of your project. However, this will start up with some default properties that makes things much easier for creating your mobile apps. So let's jump into the engine now and get started.",
