  "text": " We're now going to take a look at some ways to optimize our materials. And the first optimization we're going to talk about isn't an optimization for performance but it is an optimization for your workflow. And that's the concept of parent materials. Now for those of you who are not aware, parent materials are a way to have something pass traits on down to their children. Kind of like how in a biological family, parents pass traits on down to the children. So here we have the squares and they have the ability to be blue, red, or green. And we can see here the squares have some children and the children's have the ability to be red, green, or blue. Now again, very, very simplistic look at how parents pass traits on down to their children. But if we take that and we kind of apply it to our material system, we can get something like this. We have this matte ENV building parent and then from that we have these children that were made that were adjusted and we have one that looks exactly the same, one that looks slightly different, and one that looks completely different. We also have this matte ENV glass parent and similar. We have one that looks totally different throughout all of these. Actually all the glass ones look completely different than their parent material and that's okay. A couple of the reasons why we have it set up like this. One, since glass is a special material that we're going to be using in special instances and it also can be very expensive to render, we want to make sure that we have a parent material that's dedicated for that so that we only use that in those limited areas. This matte ENV building parent, we're going to use that probably all over. So we want to make sure that this material that we create is as optimized as possible because it's going to be used all over the place. Now a couple of things to note here. When you are creating materials you should or I recommend that you disable the automatically set usage flags and the editor option. The reason for this is it will help save on compile times should somebody accidentally put a material on something that it wasn't necessarily intended for. For example, sometimes you might find that the landscape material has used with Niagara mesh on it. The other thing is that we want to keep our materials as modular as possible to minimize pre-mutations and we want to optimize for usage not convenient. So we want to make sure that our materials only contain things that we intend to use with them and not contain things that maybe we might possibly turn on we're not really sure. The feature quality switch expression nodes allow you to ensure that whatever materials you're creating will behave correctly on a platform that might not necessarily support a certain feature. For these nodes we have a shading path feature level and quality level and basically what we do is we add these to whatever inputs such as base color or normal or roughness or metallic and then we feed in what will happen when this material is say viewed on the default deferred forward or mobile shading paths or if it detects that the feature level is default es2 es3 sm5 or sm6 or the quality of the project has been changed from default low high medium and epic. Some important notes about these just like with other static switches these generate additional shader pre-mutations for every possible combination of settings for example if we have two static switch parameters or I should say two quality switches it's going to create a possible combination of four but it's only going to use the combinations that are used in our material so just keep that in mind we want to make sure that we are using these in situations where we know some type of effect or some type of advanced material logic is not going to work on one of our target platforms so it is okay for us to pay that additional cost to make sure that the material compiles correctly. So to wrap things up we want to use shader path switches for render path specific logic we want to use feature level switches for cross-platform materials and quality switches for scalable performance we always want to make sure that to monitor pre-mutation counts as every combination of these nodes will have some type of cost.",
