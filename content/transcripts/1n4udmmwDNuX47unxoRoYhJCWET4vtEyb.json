  "text": " Now we're going to move on to just a couple of talks about various tools that you will be utilizing for gameplay code and systems code that are kind of good to be aware of that don't really fit tidily into any of those previous brackets. So first off we have delegates and events. First thing we should talk about is what actually is a delegate. This might be a kind of term and concept you're already familiar with, especially if you've worked in C sharp because they've got them there, but if you're not aware of them delegates are essentially a type that can reference and execute member functions on objects. So if you imagine a type that maintains an array of function pointers and it can maintain a reference to either a single function pointer or a set of them and then you can execute those functions from a single location, that's essentially what it is. It's an implementation of what would be called in formal terms the observer pattern. It's important to highlight and one of the great powers and uses for these things is delegates can be bound dynamically at runtime so you can change the functions that will get called back from a delegate. Classic example would be a switch in a video game. You as a designer might want a switch to open a door and then maybe one time you want to reuse that switch and have it turn on a light. And so if you do that by a delegate you're not having to really tightly couple these systems together. The light doesn't have to know or the switch doesn't have to know that it's going to be on a light and a door. The switch just knows I'm telling people that I've been switched on and it's the people who are kind of registering to that event that need to know about the light. Delegates are also safe to copy around. You can pass them around by value but it will allocate memory on the heap when you do this. So when possible when it's not too difficult passing by reference is probably a little bit more memory efficient. So there's a whole set of delegates available to us in Unreal. The kind of key ones to highlight is we have the concept of single versus multicast. So single is this is a one to one binding. You can only bind one function into this delegate at a time. If you want to have a new function you need to remove the old one. Multicast is kind of one to many binding. So three, four, twenty functions could all like link themselves, bind themselves to this one delegate and when that delegate fires all of those functions will get executed one after another. And then we have the concept of dynamic. There are both dynamic single and dynamic multicast delegates and dynamic essentially represents that they are available to the reflection system for a start. So dynamic delegates can only be used on U object and downwards types. So ones that are kind of part of the Unreal ecosystem and they particularly multicast dynamic delegates can be exposed to blueprints. That's one of the great uses for dynamic delegates. Dynamic delegates are also serializable, meaning we can save them more easily. The kind of one there's something to bear in mind about dynamic versus non-dynamic is that dynamic do tend to be slower so that they're less kind of performant and we have more capabilities available to us if we choose non-dynamic. So we can bind lambdas, we can bind function pointers to non-U object types and we can also use payloads which we can't use for dynamic delegates which we'll get into a little bit more in a bit. There is also the concept of events. This is a kind of specialized type of delegate where the execution of that delegate is restricted to a particular class so that delegate is owned by a particular class. This is still exists in code but it's just worth mentioning that whilst it still exists and you can use it, actually that rule about only being owned by this particular type isn't actually strictly enforced. So from 4.26 onwards it's deemed as essentially deprecated. So you might still find them referenced occasionally and used but actually for the express purpose for which they're intended it's not actually forced. You could kind of break that. So just some demonstrations. For a single non-dynamic delegate this is how it would look. Every time we declare a delegate it would be in a format similar to this so we'll get onto this in the following page with the other examples. You'll see this is kind of in common. These declarations always come with a declare underscore, it's a macro. So declare delegate, retval here means this is a delegate that can return a value which is only applicable for single delegates because obviously if you had a multicast if five items bind to this delegate how would you know which of those five return values are going to use? So retval is only relevant when you're doing a non-multicast delegate and one param means that this delegate takes one parameter. All forms of delegates can take up to I think it's nine parameters they can have. There's a header you can actually look into which is delegate combinations I think it is where you can just see all the different version iterations of this macro but yeah ultimately they can name conventions the same so once you've written one you'll kind of know how the rest are written. So what this does is this defines a signature for that delegate and then we define an instance of that delegate to actually bind to and to broadcast from so this is defining the signature and then this is the actual delegate that we're talking about and then in terms of actually using that delegate this is an example of the code we might have. So the kind of key things to highlight here is that because this is a non-dynamic delegate again we can bind to non-U object types so I've just created a temporary instance of this F some non-U object class using shared pointers here which we talked about in a previous session and this is just a little example of what that class actually looks like so you can see we've just got this one function it's really not very interesting class it's just a kind of very minimal implementation. This function does need to be public so that we can bind to it but if we look the delegate says it's a one parameter delegate and it's got a return value of int32 here we've specified so this function does return an int32 but it takes two parameters so the reason that this is okay the reason that you can bind this function is because we're using something called payloads so payload is essentially an ability to bind additional data to a delegate at bind time so our delegate signature says it takes in one parameter but if we want to bind to a function that takes additional parameters we just need to say and for those additional parameters here's the data to feed into those so at the point that we bind that function to that delegate we're specifying what additional data would be so in this case when we actually finally execute that delegate which is what we're doing here you can see it's because it has a return value you can we can feed that value back into a variable and do whatever we want with that we only execute and pass in the one variable that we specify here this is our one parameter but the other value that's going to be fed into this some other float has already been specified at the bind and that's going to be this number seven so when this function gets executed we're going to it's going to receive 0.2 is in float and it's going to receive 7.0 as some other float and then we can do whatever we want with that kind of things to mention here is that particularly when you're doing return values we need to be sure that this delegate is actually has something bound to it so that's what this is bound is for and when you're binding raw when you're doing things that aren't new objects so we can't count on the fact that they're going to be properly garbage collected and cleaned up when you're binding raw functions it's possible that objects get deleted before you execute the delegate which would cause a crash and there's nothing protecting us from that so you need to be quite diligent with making sure that when this object is getting destroyed you make sure it unbinds from any delegates that it might be bound to so then we move on to multicast this is also the example of non-dynamic so multicast again is our kind of one-to-many binding naming convention looks pretty similar as you can see declare multicast delegate and then our number of params we don't have a retval because multicast delegates can't return a return value but the kind of thing I wanted to highlight here was as you can see we've got a delegate signature name and then we have our two parameters so this takes a bool and a uobject pointer now this is defining a signature but multiple instances could use reuse that same signature and you will see this in unreal code sometimes we declare a signature once and then you reuse that signature for different occasions so you could imagine some situation where if really all that we care about is what input parameters it takes we don't need to do two three four different delegate declarations if we're going to have several types that essentially take the same input parameters so we have an on-hit object and an on-damaged by object that both have the same signature so we can kind of reuse that delegate signature even though these are different delegate instances and can be bound to independently so when we actually comes to kind of using this in code the kind of key things I wanted to highlight here is that when we are binding to a multicast delegate rather than do it using the term bind we use add because that's kind of the concept right it's almost like an array of functions that would call back to so we use the term add and because again this is non-dynamic we have the ability to use lambdas so for anyone who's not familiar with lambdas that's also referred to as anonymous functions it's just kind of like writing a function in line so this is we I'm not going to go into detail about these things but essentially this is the body of this function would be this isn't a function is to find somewhere else in the class is defined here in line inside our body and again because there's multicast we can add an additional function and add u object is the kind of simplest way to add a reference to a function that is part of a u object so a non raw object and then that means it's going to be automatically garbage collected it's a little bit safer if you try and bind a raw function to an object that is actually a u object or inherits from that change so in this case this is our actor which inherits from object you'll actually get told off by the compiler so it won't actually let you do that so you have to use add u object if it's a u object type or downwards and then you can just see here I've just declared a null value just to kind of have some parameter to feed in to this delegate and we can perform that same check here for is bound it's not necessary but it is you know it's it's tidy and then in turn instead of execute we use the term broadcast for multicast delegates because that's kind of more indicative of what it's doing it's letting possibly several things know it's broadcasting this this information and then last of all we actually have the dynamic delegates like I said you can have non multicast dynamic delegates but if you want this to be exposed to blueprint it does need to be multicast so whenever you make a delegate or I think they're called event dispatches in blueprint that is always a multicast dynamic delegate so this is that what that syntax would look like very very similar to the previous ones as you can see but it's declared dynamic then multicast or we wouldn't have multicast of there if it was a single one declared dynamic multicast delegate and then our number of prams again because this is multicast it can't have a return value if you do want to expose it to blueprint it does have to be dynamic multicast but also you need this additional metadata above your delegate instance so in this case you property because even though delegates kind of call two functions they are actually properties they are you know data and you use this blueprint assignable if we didn't have this above our delegate instance then it wouldn't be visible to blueprint then in terms of actually binding and using it we have very similar functions to our previous non dynamic multicasts where it's using the term add and then we it's add dynamic so we can use add dynamic or add unique dynamic if you want to make sure that you haven't already bound this function when you're typing this in it's just worth highlighting that actually sometimes your IDE will kind of do some weird things where it says it can't find the function but if you just type add unique dynamic it will actually you know it'll realize that that's okay it might try and prompt you to preface it with some underscores but that's not necessary and then otherwise it looks pretty much the same as our u-object bindings where we just specify the object that the function is getting called on and then which function we're actually caught binding to obviously this function's signature needs to match the signature of our delegate as the case with all the others as i mentioned previously we can't use payloads here so we can't use bind time data to make you know functions that don't actually have the same signature match our delegate signature so just worth bearing that in mind and then we have these same checks available to us where we can check whether or not that delegate has anything bound to it and then that same terminology broadcast for our value now we don't have to bind blueprint functions to this delegate we can also bind c++ functions but the thing that's worth highlighting about that is that if it's a dynamic delegate that function has to have a u-function metadata on it if you tried to bind a function to a dynamic delegate without u-function it would probably not cause a compile error but when you go to broadcast that it would tell you off so that's just that's something to bear in mind and then last of all this is just what it would look like in blueprint the one thing i haven't actually touched on here is that with our delegate signature declaration with dynamic delegates you specify for each parameter you specify the parameter type and then also a default name for that parameter and that's not relevant here you can see these names don't match up you can in c++ you can call it whatever you like but at blueprint if you go to bind to that delegate automatically it will use this default name as your parameter name so i have not typed that in i i just dragged off this event and typed custom event and it auto generated this and it used float parameter name as the default name for that parameter so that's a kind of difference that you'll notice between delegate signature declarations is with non-dynamics you don't specify a name per parameter but for dynamic delegates you do have to do an additional argument that is a name for each parameter so if this were two parameters it would be you know float float param name bool bool param name or whatever so that about wraps it up for delegates",
