  "text": " Hi, everyone. In this lesson, we're going to take a look at some tips and tricks and plugins when it comes to working with Unreal. So let's get started. So one of the things you do need or several things, I should say, you do need to look out for is one is glowing objects that can give off light with Lumen, but can create artifacts if the object is too small. So keep in mind your size and scale. Moving glowing items can be trouble also. You'll see in the example here, I have a moving texture that has a glowing material in there. The problem with that is you can't get noise on that. So just be aware of size, scale and exactly how fast that movement might be. Merged Nanite objects, objects do not work well with Nanite processes as a calculation, can be a double workload. So you want to make sure that you're not merging Nanite objects or converting merged objects, which came in Nanite into a new Nanite object. That is a bit more than Unreal really needs. And you can keep those separate if you need to. Not a problem. Then I can handle them pretty well. But again, use everything in moderation. Only place it in your world as needed. So Nanite objects don't work well with splines, shapes by default, construction scripts with splines can give visual display issues. So make sure you adjust if you do use them in a construction scenario, like I showed you earlier on in video. You adjust your max edge length factor and make it so that the best possible silhouette is being displayed by that object in that blueprint construction script using hardware ray tracing to support Lumen is the best approach for performance and helps with intersection geo calculations. Ambient inclusion, static fraction, if turned off in the project settings is not supported by some Quixel materials and AO in the material will need to be edited to avoid deep black shadows. So older versions of Quixel with older materials set in. If you decide to turn that off, as some of our recommendations say, to get the best possible results for your Lumen, you may run into deep dark shadows and you'll have to go into the parent material and adjust the AO so that it is not giving you these deep shadows and working correctly. Here are some plugins that you can look at and you definitely can use them for your scene, not all of them may be necessary, but they're there to be able to help you as you go. You'll see there's volume metrics as well as PCG, which we talked about. Substance Painter plugin is available for those that may not be aware of it. Niagara Fluids, if you do need that in your scene, there's an M5 VX Volume 2 Fire and Flames with Niagara. It's free and works pretty well. And you have a temperate vegetation if you want to try that out. But we do have new vegetation coming down the pipe pipe that is going to be more voxel based and can be really helpful. So be ready for that in the next coming builds. Common UI interactive world is free. We have an Alembic importer. We have Groom and Etc. if needed. Datasmith if you're using 3D Studio Max can be super helpful and all KS plugins, of course, as you need. So be aware of what is experimental and what isn't experimental. So you don't want to ship necessarily with experimental features because there are a few things such as in some of the water features as well as such as some of the data Smith. And you'll find them in a few items that we have that I've pointed out earlier. You such as Megalights. So just tread with caution and try things out as you go.",
