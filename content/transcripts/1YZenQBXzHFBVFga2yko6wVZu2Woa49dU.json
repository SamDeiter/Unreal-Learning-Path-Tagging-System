  "text": " In order to nativeise any of your blueprints to C++, just go over to Edit, Project Settings, and then we are going to go over to our Packaging Settings. Then if you go right down to the bottom, you will see Blueprints as a section. The option next to it is Blueprint Nativeisation Method that you will see is disabled by default. However, if you do a drop down, you are going to have a choice between inclusive and exclusive. There is also below here an advanced drop down, and with this there will be the option for List of Blueprint Assets to Nativeise. Now if we change this from disabled to exclusive, then we are going to have to go away and make a list of all the different assets that we wish to nativeise. If we were to select inclusive, then it would go away and take every blueprint that we have in the programme and nativeise it by default. So the difference is, if you select inclusive, then the whole project is going to run a little bit faster, because it is going to go away and nativeise every single one of the blueprints in the project. However, if you do exclusive, it is going to be a bit more fiddly, because you are going to have to name every file individually, but this is going to actually help with the bloat of the programme, because it isn't going to have to go away and do all of the blueprints. Because every blueprint that is nativeised, yes, would be faster, but it would also have extra machine instructions in order for it to be written into something that could actually be read. So be aware that it has its trade-offs. Nativeised is going to run faster, but increase the bloat size of the project. It's down to you to decide how you want to optimise your programme.",
