  "text": " A significant hurdle when authoring UI with a code backend is that of grabbing parts of the visuals that don't yet exist. For instance, how can we update a text field in code when the field itself was added later in Blueprint, because we won't have a reference to it. Luckily, Unreal presents two exceptionally important new property specifiers to empower the UI programmer, that being the bind widget and the bind widget anim. Let's take a look at how we'd go about using them and what functions we'd bring in around them to develop more smarter pieces of UI. Bind widget is a meta specifier intended for use with widget pointers in our user widget classes and allows a designer to populate native C++ level members with a designer created widget. This does kind of fly in the face of the general Unreal development pipeline, that of a Blueprint layer sitting on top of a C++ one. In this case, we're essentially leaving a gap in the C++ layer for a Blueprint layer to fill it in for us. Let's talk through a practical example. Let's say we've got a C++ class based off of user widget with a UTextBlock member. The UTextBlock container is exactly what you'd think it is. It's a widget capable of rendering text in UMG. If we flag this up with the bind widget specifier, we're saying to the compiler that this particular widget is populated from the designer layer. We don't need to initialize it in the native code like we would with an actor component. This frees up any UI designers to implement the TextBlock for us and change its visuals, its positions, its parenting, and any other parameters that they may need to adjust as per the design. As engineers, we're now free to assume that this field is now valid and can carry on developing as we would otherwise. But of course, it is a pointer, so validity checks are still always a pretty smart idea. But you may be asking yourself, why can we assume it's valid? Well, the Blueprint will fail to compile if it's not compliant with the underlying native code. Bind widget is signaling to the Blueprint layer, hey, I need a widget of this type with this specific name to properly work, so you need to add one. Failure to comply will manifest much like any other Blueprint compilation failure. A warning error will be thrown up as soon as we try and play the game in the editor and a whole host of errors will be thrown into the log, so it's not a good time. It's worth noting that the bind widget will happily bind to an existing widget as long as it matches in name and in type. The compiler isn't looking for the creation of such a widget, it's merely looking for the existence of one. Once we compile with a compliant widget in the designer, the Blueprint compiler is going to populate the underlying C++ with the designer version of the widget, filling any gaps we may have deliberately left. At this point, we've not actually got any widgets in the viewport, we're still just looking at the designer. Why would we need any widgets to be passed down into the native code when we're not actually running the game? This is where our smart UI elements come into play. Synchronized properties is a virtual function that we can override to develop smart, responsive UI tools. In many ways, it mirrors the on-construction or post-edit property virtuals we typically use when authoring smart actor classes. It will be called every time a property changes within a specified widget in both the designer and at runtime. Because it's called both at runtime and in the designer, we more often than not want to branch the logic inside depending on the current environment. Wrapping logic in a isDesignTime check means we can quite easily run design only logic. So let's take a look at a practical example of how we'd use bind widget in combination with synchronized properties to empower the UI designers as well as ourselves to build more complex pieces of UI. In this example, we're implementing the synchronized properties function and supering it back up the chain so there's nothing special there. We're then checking to see if we're in the designer and if so, we check to see if the container widget is valid. Container widget in this instance is a bind widget property. If we've yet to create a valid widget in the designer for this property to bind to, when we compile we're going to hit a null pointer. If it does exist, however, we're going to remove all the children that are inside so we've got a fresh container to work with before proceeding through our dynamic spawn of as many children as the childNumMember is set to. Of course, this is a very simplistic example but even here we can see the implications of real authoring. The alternative would be a designer manually creating a vertical box and dragging in as many images as they want directly. What if the specifications change and we need to increase the number of images? Suddenly we're dealing with a less than trivial UI rework. With smart and sensible use of synchronized properties, we can author responsive piece of UI that empower the team as opposed to laboring them with more work than is strictly necessary. Bind widget anim allows us to grab named animations from the designer, much in the same way that we grab widgets when using the bind widget. When defining animations in native C++, we simply create a member of type U widget animation and use the name of the animation to create the underlying binding. When we want the animation to play, it's as simple as calling the play animation from within our user widget, passing along the bound animation. Much like bind widget, a failure to bind to an animation of a particular name will also cause a compilation failure. We'll also fail to compile if the widget animation isn't marked with the transient specifier along with the bind widget anim meta. This is primarily due to how widgets themselves play animations under the hood. During the compilation, the animations themselves get copied out of the user widget into a holding container as part of the transient package. Marking the animations as transient prevents these copied versions from being serialized.",
