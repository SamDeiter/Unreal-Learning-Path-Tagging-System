  "text": " So if you're anything like myself, you probably have a little bit of cascade knowledge and you're looking to transfer that knowledge to Niagara. One of the easiest ways to figure out how things inside of Cascade can translate into Niagara is to use the Cascade to Niagara converter plugin. Now this plugin, which is still in beta, so if you are considering using it for production, be aware that it does have a limited feature set at this time, is really powerful because it allows you to take an existing Cascade effect and convert it to Niagara simply by right clicking on it. Now to enable this functionality, you do need to enable the Cascade to Niagara converter plugin. Now if we pop over here to the editor and go to edit plugins, on the left hand side underneath built in, we're going to look for the FX section. When you click on that, the first plugin you see is the Cascade to Niagara converter. Now mine is already enabled. Once you enable the plugin, you'll be prompted to restart the editor. Go ahead and do that and then when you restart it, you'll have this option. So let's go over here to our particles and if I right click, you can see here I now have this convert to Niagara system. Now before I do that though, let's go ahead and come over here and just drag this onto the content and go copy here. I'm just going to make a copy of this so that we have something to come back to in case you know we mess it up or something like that. I'm also going to come up here to file new level and I'm going to select the new default level. And I'm going to take this smoke here and just bring it in so we have an idea of what we're looking at here. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click and convert to Niagara system. But before I do that, I want to explain what we're about to do. So when we open up this Niagara system, depending on what type of effect it is, it might work or it might not work. The reason for this is there are going to be certain things that we need to either adjust or press one of these fix issue buttons or dismiss issue buttons in order to get rid of the warning or the error. So let's go ahead and pop over here back to the editor and I'm going to open up this particle. And while the particle is going to start spawning, if we were to just drag this right into the level here, it doesn't look like the counterpart particle, right? So this is the cascade one and this is the one that we converted. Now it looks very similar. The smoke just happens to be going in a different direction. This smoke over here is kind of going over to the left and then kind of dragging down. And this one, while it's still going to the right direction, it's actually going up, right? Subtle difference, but still not exactly the same. So let's see what we can do inside of here to fix this. So if we click on our emitter update, underneath spawn rate, you can see here we have an unspecified error. Converting B apply global spawn rate scale. Basically, this is no longer something that is applicable to Niagara. So what we can actually do is just acknowledge and clear this because little yellow triangles are just issues that don't necessarily prevent this from rendering or interacting correctly. What we do need to worry about though are the unmet dependencies or the red exclamation points and don't fear. All we need to do to fix this is just hit the fix issues button here and the fix issues button here. Let's just compile and save for good measure. I'm going to go ahead and close this. And now what we have is a particle that looks exactly like the converted one. So again, this is our Niagara system or I'm sorry, this is our cascade system and this is our Niagara system. And that's what we want. We want something that when we look at it, it looks exactly the same as in this slide where we have our before where the smoke is kind of trailing up. By fixing those issues by simply pressing the fix issue button, we now have an effect that looks exactly like the original one. And that's really what we want.",
