00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Now, in this section of working with Cine Camera Actors, we're going to take a brief

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.380
look at the other optional camera components that you might use frequently in Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.360
When working with Cine Camera Actors, these three camera components can enhance your ability

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.360
to work with Unreal Engine.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.960
The first being a Scene Capture Component 2D.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.440
Now, this component captures a simple snapshot of the scene from a camera and feeds it directly

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.760
into a render target texture.

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.400
Working with the release of Unreal Engine 5.3, Unreal Engine introduced a new component

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.280
called the Cine Capture Component 2D.

10
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.080
This is a plugin that is in beta, and it extends the capabilities of the Capture Component

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.360
that respects the Cine Camera settings, allowing you to have color profiles such as OCIO, correct

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.460
depth of field, lens distortion, and a one-to-one view of the Cine Camera captured and then

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.280
applied to the render target texture.

14
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.360
Just like the Scene Capture Component 2D, but better.

15
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.560
The third component that you are likely to work with is the Vcam Actor.

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.360
This virtual camera component is used to transmit camera motion and control settings remotely

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.840
through the Live Link plugin and companion app found on the Apple Store.

18
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.760
Alright, that's it for this camera component section of working with Cine Camera Actors.

19
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.800
In our next section, I'm going to walk you through a step-by-step guide that I've created

20
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.640
for you to follow along and build a control rig for use with a Cine Camera Actor for

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
more realistic camera animation.
