00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Now, in this section, we're going to begin with a discussion about working with cinecamera

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.200
actors.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.560
Starting out, we're going to look at Unreal Engine's camera basics.

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.580
When working with cinecamera actors, you're generally going to find that there are two

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.920
main camera actor types.

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.640
The first camera actor is the cinecamera actor, which is the most common camera used in film

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.000
productions or other linear content projects.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.600
The cinecamera actor was specifically built to emulate a real-world physical camera inside

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.260
Unreal Engine.

10
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.720
It is very similar to the other camera actor type, but with some additional cinematic film

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.280
controls such as film back, lens, focus tracking, and post-process, among others.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
The game camera actor is the most common camera actor found in games, and because of its simplicity,

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.120
this is more often used as the player's view camera.

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.200
The only real control here is your field of view, and unlike the cinecamera, those extra

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.880
cinematic camera controls are not available on the game camera actor.

16
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.360
Now there are a few ways to actually add camera actors into your levels.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.440
The first does not require an active level sequence.

18
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.920
Simply navigate over to the Place Actors tab, select the Cinematic section, and drag the

19
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.880
cinecamera actor into your level.

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.640
One thing to note here is that when you place your cinecamera actor from this tab into your

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.240
level, it is a possessable actor, and can be dragged from the outliner into any active

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.480
level sequence.

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.720
Another way to add cinecamera actors to any active level sequence is to click on the camera

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.720
icon, and that will automatically add a spotable cinecamera actor, and once that camera is

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.360
active in a level or through sequencer, you will have access to the camera actor details

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
panel.

27
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.800
The details panel has several camera settings that we want to look at, and the most notable

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.680
settings are the ones for the cinecamera.

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.880
Settings such as the film back presets, which allows you to select a specific type of film

30
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.680
back, or to manually adjust your camera sensor aspect ratios, width, and height.

31
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.120
Next are the lens settings, and it is here that you can adjust your focal length, f-stop,

32
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.640
apply a squeeze factor that will allow you to emulate the look of an anamorphic lens,

33
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.080
or adjust the diaphragm blade count.

34
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.800
Set that lower to have a polygonal shape, or higher to create a soft, more rounded shape

35
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.520
for your bokeh.

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.880
You'll also find focus settings for the cinecamera here, that allow you to set manual focus distance,

37
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.960
activate the debug focus plane, which is a very important tool that I will demonstrate

38
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.520
a little later, and the focus offset.

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.840
Similar to the focus settings, there are also tracking settings, such as enabling look at

40
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.760
tracking, that we will look at more in depth in another section of this course.

41
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.480
Finally, there are also several post-process options connected to the cinecamera, allowing

42
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.640
for post-process control to be added to the cinecamera directly.

43
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.360
Last, there is one very important topic left to discuss when working with cinecamera actors

44
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.600
in Sequencer, and that is the use of the camera cuts track.

45
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.440
Every single cinecamera that gets added to Sequencer must be bound to the camera cuts

46
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.920
track, which controls the active camera being viewed through the assigned camera bindings.

47
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.600
Note, the camera binding IDs can be changed in the properties for any specified camera

48
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.760
in your camera cuts track, by right-clicking on the camera cut track, and making the connections

49
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.320
through the camera cuts track properties.

50
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.840
Without a camera cuts track, the cameras in your level will not be active in the cinematic

51
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
view, resulting in being unable to render the cinecamera.

52
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.560
Okay, that's it for this section of working with cinecamera actors.

53
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.920
In our next section, we will take a quick look at the camera components available to

54
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.680
use with Sequencer.
