00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
Now, in this section, we will look at modification tracks, which will serve as a precursor to

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.520
what we will use in Unreal Engine to control sequencer editorial transitions.

3
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.740
Starting out, there are two modification tracks that we are going to focus on.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.680
And the first is the level visibility tracks.

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.280
Level visibility tracks can control the visibility of any level or sublevel, and is used to switch

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.160
between various lighting setups or comps, different staging layouts, and effects.

7
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Level visibility tracks can also be used in conjunction with the material parameter based

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.600
transitions controlled through sequencer to create cinematic transitions like the crossfade,

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.760
to achieve a perceived passage of time, create match cuts, or make location changes.

10
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.440
One thing to note though is that if your levels are very heavy, you might see a delay as the

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.400
assets load into the level.

12
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.960
The next modification track that we are going to look at is the material parameter collection,

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960
or MPC.

14
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.140
And in order to get deeper access to the myriad of properties a static or skeletal mesh actor

15
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.440
may have, you'll want to access its mesh components.

16
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.920
Exposing the mesh components can help you keyframe specific properties in sequencer

17
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.640
such as an asset's material settings.

18
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.000
Properties like material elements can be exposed and controlled transitionally and

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
blended through sequencer.

20
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.920
Or material switcher properties can be exposed and allow a user to switch between materials

21
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.520
applied to the mesh through sequencer keyframes.

22
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.400
One thing to note, the switch is an on or off option and cannot be blended like you

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.800
can with material elements.

24
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.120
Now let's jump into the engine and take a look at the modification tracks in action.

25
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.240
So let's move over into the mod tracks folder and take a look what's set up for you in this

26
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.880
folder.

27
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.880
Inside this folder you will find two material parameter collection assets, two level sequence

28
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.960
examples and a folder containing two more level sequences that will be used as sub-sequences

29
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.040
to demonstrate animated action in the modification tracks examples.

30
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.960
The parameters collected in the MPC Car Paint will be used in the Material Parameters level

31
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.040
sequence.

32
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.000
But we're going to start out with the level visibility track level sequence.

33
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.880
Double click to open the level visibility track.

34
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.840
And then lock the camera to the cinematic viewport so that we can see what's happening

35
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.800
within our camera.

36
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.240
Next move over to the levels tab.

37
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.440
It's next to the outliner.

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.400
Turn that on so that you can see the persistent level, broadcast, desert, oasis and rally

39
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.800
sublevels.

40
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.680
The broadcast sublevel is not going to be affected by the level visibility track.

41
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.040
But before we play through this level sequence, let's move down to the sequencer controls

42
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.380
and turn on playback looping.

43
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.060
This way the desert and oasis sublevels will turn on and off as we play through our transition

44
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.220
a few times.

45
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.980
This will give you a chance to make sure that you can see the eyeball icon in the levels

46
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.080
tab turn on or off for each sublevel.

47
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.240
If we stop and move through the level sequence more deliberately, pay attention to what's

48
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.860
happening in the viewport.

49
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.860
If we move first from the desert into the active desert scene and then from the desert

50
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.500
into the oasis scene, you will see assets appear in the sublevels as you move from section

51
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.300
to section.

52
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.540
Note, for any of this to work, the sublevel track requires an array to be added to the

53
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.600
properties of that level visibility track and the sublevel name must be manually typed

54
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.840
into the index field.

55
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.000
Spelling is a factor here, so be careful to get the name exactly correct.

56
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.560
Of the array in the visibility field, you will be able to switch between hidden and

57
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.360
visible inside the pulldown menu.

58
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.620
This is how you switch between each section, but each switch requires another copy of each

59
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.880
of the visibility tracks themselves.

60
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.880
You'll notice a breakpoint between these as the two tracks are turned on and off.

61
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:44.860
Alright, now let's look at the material parameter collections as a modification track.

62
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.260
First double-click to open the material parameters level sequence.

63
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.740
This level sequence is going to use the same action subsequence track, but by adding a material

64
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.480
parameter track to the level sequence from the tracks button, the material parameters

65
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.760
have been exposed to sequencer, allowing access to the parameters to make changes that can

66
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.840
be keyframed in sequencer.

67
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.760
Again, by adding these tracks from the track menu in the material parameter collection

68
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
and choosing the MPC car paint that we've got, we are able to keyframe these on our

69
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.240
timeline and make changes to our transitions.

70
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.960
In this collection, we have loaded a vector parameter.

71
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.240
By using the plus button and choosing the vector color.

72
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.980
This color option exposes the RGB values and allows us to choose a 0 to 1 value to modify

73
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.580
the car paint.

74
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.640
As you can see the keyframes here change the value of the car paint.

75
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.700
And as we did before, let's lock our camera to our viewport and make sure the looping

76
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.660
is enabled in sequencer and play the level sequence.

77
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.260
As the SUV travels through the level, you can see the keyframed car paint blend from

78
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.280
one color to the next.

79
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.160
If you are interested in how to create material parameter collections, there is a materials

80
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.920
course that is available for this specific topic.

81
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.160
I encourage you to check that out as you continue your Unreal Engine training.

82
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.260
Alright, that's it for sequencer modification tracks.

83
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.660
In our next section, we're going to take a look at using modification tracks for editorial control.

84
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.660
Thanks for watching!
