  "text": " Okay, so the next thing that we need to look at within the context of lightmaps and lightmaps are view modes and visualizers that are going to help us understand what's actually going on under the hood when it comes to performance optimization. So the target is that we're going to cover for the visualizers are going to be light complexity and lightmap density. Now they're really easy to access, all you have to do is go to the view mode tab and go to optimization modes and choose either of these. In the case of lightmap complexity it's going to be view mode, optimization view modes and light complexity. It will give you essentially a colored view as you can see here of the scene that explains how complex a particular lighting setup is for a given pixel. So you'll notice that overlap in movable lights will be very expensive, they'll go closer to the sort of pink white range and you'll see the static lights are basically free. So bake your light wherever possible if you're using the lightmap solution because it will be the cheapest way of rendering your scene. The next one is going to be lightmap density which is going to be in the same spot just right below it and it displays the density based on the tessellation display. Try and keep your lightmaps as low as possible and essentially there's still help in general with bacon and optimization bacon times specifically. So let's go ahead and take a look at how this actually works. So if I go into the editor with the project that you've been supplied for this, I've gone to my interior scene so going to lighting1031, interior and I've just opened the level. Let's take a look at how we can see those optimization view modes. So I'm going to go to my view mode tab, go to optimization view modes and look at light complexity. So here you can see the areas where light is basically fully baked, very very little performance impact but the more dynamic in certain areas the lights become and the more overlapping we have the more expensive it becomes. Let's take a quick look at it. If I just add a light now without building and essentially calculate it as dynamic. So I'll go to lights, point light and drag one in. I'm going to set it as moveable so we're not technically needing to build this but this is being calculated at runtime right. So if I take a look at that lighting complexity again you'll notice it starts to get really expensive. As I duplicate lights and have overlaps of those light radiuses you'll see it grows exponentially almost. So something to keep in mind again bake whatever you can but as I say this view mode here is going to help you a lot to understand you know why your frame rate might be dropping in certain areas due to lighting. So the next thing is going to be optimization view modes lightmap density and you can see here it allows you to see the density of a particular Now if a mesh for example was a little too high for example these small ones it will appear as red and that's just down to the resolution that it has per size on the screen or density. So one thing you can do is you can overwrite the lightmap resolution and let's say for example I set this to 1024 you can see it shows us much smaller little squares and it starts to give us the information on the visualization mode here that it's a little higher than the rest of the scene around it so that's something to keep in mind. One other thing to keep in mind with this is that it's better to have the general scene kind of have an overall similar tone and the reason for this is if you have a very high resolution mesh here or lightmap resolution here compared to this one you'll probably start to notice differences in the resolution of the shadows and that's something to keep in mind that you know it can make things a little bit more noticeable in that sense so try and keep things nice and consistent. And that's really it for visualization view modes in terms of lighting. Next we'll take a look at IES profiles.",
