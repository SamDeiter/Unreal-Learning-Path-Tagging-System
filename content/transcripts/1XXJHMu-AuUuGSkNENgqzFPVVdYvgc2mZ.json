  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video on the exercise setup. So in this video, we're just going to go through and we're going to get ourselves ready so that we can do the exercise. So to start with, I am going to fire up the Epic launcher and then I'm going to go over to the library tab here. And I'm going to hit launch on the engine version 5.32, which is the latest as of the time of recording. You, however, can use any version you want to. I'm then going to wait for this to fire up. I'm then going to come under the games templates and I'm going to select the third person template. I'm selecting this because this will have a skeletal mesh and a whole load of animations that we can use. I'll just leave the project on blueprint and place it somewhere and hit the create button. Once this is fired up, you should see a project which looks a little bit like this. Now, if I was to hit play, you can see that we have Quinn here when she is already fully animated and can move around the level. I'm going to want to disconnect that. So I'm going to come down into the content browser. And I will dock the content browser in the layout. Now, I'm going to go to the content directory within the project, right-hand click, and I'm going to create a new folder. And I'm going to call this my animation blueprint. I'm just going to use this directory so that I can just find all the files that I'm working with. I will jump into the my animation blueprint directory, right-hand click, and under animation, we have a selection animation blueprint. When I select that, it's not going to automatically create the blueprint. It's going to ask me to specify a skeleton. And in this case, I'm going to use the SK underscore mannequin. And I'm going to push create. Now I will name this my animation BP. I just prefixed it with my and you'll see me do this a fair amount during the exercise. I'm just doing this because it helps me identify the files that I'm working with. I'm going to come back to the content directory. I'm going to go into the third person directory and into the blueprint directory. And here you will find the BP third person character. Now I am going to duplicate this third person character. And I'm going to put a my at the beginning here. Now I'm going to move that blueprint into the my animation blueprint directory. This means that we have our own character porn to work with. Now in the world settings. I am going to come down to the game mode, do the drop down. And with the default porn class, I'm going to change that to my third person character. So that means that we've now using the new blueprint as our porn class. One last thing I want to do and that is jump in and double click on the third person character. This will open up the blueprint for the third person character. I will dock it at the top here. And in the components, I'm going to find the skeletal mesh. And you'll be able to see under animation, we have the animation class AP Quinn. Now, if I search for my, I'm going to swap that over to my animation blueprint class. I'm going to compile and save. Now we'll find that we can still move around the world and we can still jump up and down. However, we just have Quinn here in the head pose. So there is no animation going on at all at this point. But that's great because this is what we can then use to build it all back again from scratch throughout the rest of the exercise. And with that, we have finished the setup for the exercise. In the next video, we'll be able to jump in and start creating our own animation blueprint from scratch.",
