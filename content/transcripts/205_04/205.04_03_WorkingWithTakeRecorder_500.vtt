00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's now look at how Teams may work with Take Recorder.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.960
So as we mentioned in the opening slides,

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.360
you'll capture this Take Recorder content

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.360
and use it via Sequencer.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.360
Now, Sequencer has some great sub scene tools to use.

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.680
So we can see that there's various tracks

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.000
as a sub scene within the master sequence.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.640
So we can hold a sequence with all our shot information

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.840
at the top there.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.040
And then also the sub scene tracks,

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.400
you can almost think about them as layers

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.900
and maybe a DCC app.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.960
You can see that different departments can then work

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.800
and organize depending on what is actually happening

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.680
in the scene.

16
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.560
So you can see that we split the sub scenes

17
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.920
into character animation, effects, cameras, lighting, sound.

18
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.640
But again, that's going to be dependent

19
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.720
on the size of your project and what departments you have.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.480
And then we can also say within this animation track,

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.560
for example, we have multiple animators

22
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.200
or multiple character performances

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.160
that we want to keep isolated.

24
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.960
So you can see that we have a meerkat, an eagle

25
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.660
and an egg sub scene as well.

26
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.640
So you can nest them within each sub scene as well.

27
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.400
So you can get as granular as you want here.

28
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
You don't want to get overly complex unnecessarily

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.280
and be unable to find the information,

30
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.880
but needless to say, using sub scene tracks

31
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.960
can help you quickly organize

32
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.640
and break down workflows between departments there.

33
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.460
It's also worth noting that you can record microphone inputs

34
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.080
into the tape recorder and therefore be able to edit

35
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.840
the audio within Sequencer.

36
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.640
So using audio gain multiplies the incoming audio power.

37
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.840
So gain can make it a blow out if the gain is too high

38
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680
and the audio is too low, loud, sorry.

39
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080
But the most important feature is the ability

40
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.560
to split stereo channels into separate tracks

41
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.820
for later editing.

42
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.080
So it's good for two person conversations.

43
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.720
You can also include more than one input.

44
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.880
So if you need to record any kind of audio information

45
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.000
whilst doing your takes, then that is also an option

46
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.280
through the source inside the tape recorder.
