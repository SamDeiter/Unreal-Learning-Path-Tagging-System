Hello and welcome to today's Unreal Engine training on Sequencer with Performance Capture

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.440
and Take Recorder.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.680
So today we're going to be covering what Take Recorder is and how you can use it.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.560
We'll talk about some of the features that you can utilize when working with Take Recorder.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.080
I will also talk about Active Performance Recording and then dig into how you might

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.680
capture a vehicle performance, a Live Link Face setup and then talk about MetaHuman Layered

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.480
Facial Performance Capture.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.280
And then we'll talk about how to edit the capture data within Sequencer.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280
So let's jump in.
