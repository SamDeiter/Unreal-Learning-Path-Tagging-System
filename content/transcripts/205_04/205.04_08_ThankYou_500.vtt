Which brings us to the close of this course today with talking about performance capture with take recorder.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we covered a lot of ground here today. We talked about the take recorder and the different features and functions,

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then set up a few examples, whether it be through the vehicle performance, just setting up facial capture support

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and even working with meta humans inside of Unreal Engine, and then discussing how you might utilize sequencer and tie all these elements together.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So hopefully you found that useful and interesting today. So thank you again for watching and we'll see you in the next video.
