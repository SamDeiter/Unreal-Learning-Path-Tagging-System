00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We'll start off by looking at take recorder.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So take recorder essentially enables you to record quickly and iteratively inside of Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So you can easily record animations from motion capture linked to characters in the level.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You can see these two meerkats here.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We can record their performances and grab the animations from those performances.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And then you can also use live link data for future playback.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So recording the takes and adding them into Sequencer, which you can see at the bottom here.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It allows for productions of all sizes and any number of takes can be accommodated.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So it's a really great tool, especially when working in larger teams.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And we'll dig into some of those workflows as we go here.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we can actually find our take recorder window.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we go to the window button in the top of the editor.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And if you're using more recent versions when Unreal Engine, I believe 5.1 or later,

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you can actually just type in the take recorder and it should filter through the available windows and find take recorder.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Alternatively, you can browse through the submenus and find take recorder there.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But essentially the interface, once you have it pinned to your editor somewhere, you can see we have 10 key areas to look at here.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So we've got the create new take button, pretty self-explanatory there.

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And then you can also review a previous recording or even start a new recording using that take as a base.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So you can kind of layer up the take recording, as we mentioned in the previous slide.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can also show and hide the take browser, the level sequence and also the take recorder project settings up at the top right there.

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And then we can also with the big red button there, record the take that we wanted to capture.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We have some timestamp and frame rate information displayed to make sure you're aligned correctly with what you're capturing.

23
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And then we also have the various sources for recording.

24
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'll talk about how to add sources to the recording in a short while here.

25
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But you can see that we've added two meerkats in this example so that when we press record,

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
any kind of performance data they're presenting to the end user in real time, that will all be captured,

27
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which then can be played back offline.

28
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Then we have in section nine, we can add a little description for our take, especially when you're working with multiple takes.

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This can be very useful to add some descriptors there.

30
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And of course, in a similar vein, number 10 allows you to edit the slate take name and number to make sure all the takes are being organized correctly.

31
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You can find some additional resources at the link at the bottom of the page here,

32
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which will dig into any additional information you might need to know about take recorder.

33
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So as we said, the most common usage of take recorder will be projects using Live Link.

34
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So because take recorder enables you to quickly record performances using Live Link, it's an easy way to update and iterate on previous takes.

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So you can see that this is how we might add the various actors to the performance.

36
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You can either click on the source here and from actor and then it'll allow you to select any actors that are currently in the in the world map to this take recorder.

37
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
You can also drag and drop from the world outline panel in your editor.

38
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You just drag and drop them into this actor area here and it'll add them there.

39
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And then you also just need to make sure you update the take recorder record type to the appropriate settings.

40
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So you can edit a certain amount of properties here.

41
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So you can see that we have this meerkat selected and we say, OK, how do we want to record?

42
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Do we want to reduce any key information? Do we want to record parent hierarchy?

43
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But then also we have tracks that are specific to this actor type.

44
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So in this instance, it's the blueprint meerkat.

45
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So do you want to record whether it's hidden or not hidden?

46
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Do you want to record any attached tracks, transform tracks, things like this?

47
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Essentially, you can capture all the data and even if you don't feel like you need it right now, you can use it later today.

48
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now, the flip side to that little caveat to add is that you don't want to record too much data that the data becomes overwhelming.

49
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So if it's just content that you may just never end up needing, you can go ahead and untick that and it won't capture those properties.

50
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
However, it's always good to have some information to work with.

51
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So as we said, we can layer up multiple takes and so you can record as many takes as you need by repeating the process or using existing take as a base, as we showed in the UI section just on the previous slide.

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So you can see a few settings that you may want to look at and dial in.

53
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You can even change things like the countdown time.

54
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So if a three second countdown is a little bit too short or maybe too long, you can adjust that to your preference.

55
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And of course, we've got the additional resources at the bottom there for you to dig into further properties.

56
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The way we might start thinking about capturing both cameras and actor performances is through the use of some external hardware.

57
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So you could use cine cameras, which can be genlocked to the editor and you can record directly through the cine camera via pixel streaming is also a possibility if you're using an iPad.

58
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So if you want a slightly lower cost, more low cost solution, you can download the virtual camera app to the iPad.

59
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It is a free app supported by Epic on the App Store.

60
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Alternatively, there is a paid app on the marketplace for an Android capture app.

61
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So just check what kind of motion recording setups you prefer.

62
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's going to depend on the project size and scale.

63
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But needless to say, there's a multitude of performance capture and camera motion recording options available.

64
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Then we also have some actor performance recording.

65
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Maybe you want to use something like Xsense or some other kind of performance capture setup.

66
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There's a few different options on the market there.

67
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And again, it depends on the budget and the scalability of the project, what you're trying to achieve, depending on what approach you decide to take there.
