00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
Let's now get into a few practical examples of how you can use Tick Recorder within your

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
project.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.980
So we'll look at some vehicle performance capture first.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.400
So for this example, we're using the vehicle template map.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.920
You can see that there's an SUV vehicle in the scene, which is the BP SUV, which you

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.640
can drag and drop into the level here.

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.600
You need some kind of input device.

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.840
I assume you have some kind of keyboard and mouse attached, but if you're working on,

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.400
say, a mobile device at the moment, just make sure you have some kind of external peripherals

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.000
plugged in that allow you to control this car.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.080
So maybe you have some kind of game controller plugged in as well.

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.280
That would also be fine.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.480
So when we drag and drop in the car, we can add the SUV to the source here.

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Again, you could either click on source and select the BP SUV.

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.320
Or as we previously said, you can drag and drop from the world outliner to get the SUV

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.320
in there.

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.520
And you can decide what vehicle data you're recording based on the record properties that

18
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520
are listed.

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.000
So we have seven different options that you might want to look at there.

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.640
Then it's mainly a case of hit and record.

21
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
Once you have your Tick Recorder open, again, we have this big red button that we can hit

22
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240
record.

23
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.620
The countdown will play.

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.540
If you change the countdown settings, maybe it'll go from a different number, but you'll

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.420
essentially get a three, two, one.

26
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.780
Then you'll just be able to drive around, capture whatever information you want and

27
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.100
then hit stop.

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.020
And then the take will save and then you'll be able to open it within Sequencer.

29
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.120
So when you have this recording saved, again, dependent on your naming conventions, as we

30
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.420
talked about with the Tick Recorder settings, you'll find your sequence nested within whatever

31
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.320
parameters you set within the content browser.

32
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.480
So therefore we can locate this and load up the performance data.

33
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.180
So once we've loaded the sequence, you can see that we've got our SUV here.

34
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.760
And then if we want to use this as an animation for later in the project, we just want to

35
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:19.240
zero out any transforms inside this capture data as the vehicle uses root motion animation.

36
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.240
So the skeletal mesh will move away from the root location.

37
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.180
So if you want to follow the vehicle, you can select the mesh in the viewport.

38
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.860
From the details panel here, you can see that we've got the BP.

39
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.640
You can select the vehicle mesh component, hit F to focus on the SUV, which F on the

40
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.720
keyboard is a shortcut to focus.

41
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.160
And then you'll be able to track that vehicle within your recorded data.

42
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.720
But essentially that's how you would capture vehicle.

43
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.040
Nice, straightforward.

44
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.440
Just have a play around with the various setups and especially with the information that you

45
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.400
may want to record within that sequence.

46
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
Because again, it will give you a lot of power, especially in post if you're trying to add

47
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.640
certain elements or effects, for example.

48
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.880
They've all been captured live for use later on.
