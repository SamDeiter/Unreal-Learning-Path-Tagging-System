00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
And then lastly, before we close out here, let's talk about how we might look at editing this in

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.720
Sequencer. So you can see that we've got our curve editor open in the top here. You can find your

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.080
curve editor by clicking this little curve button here. Maybe you want to maximize the window to see

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.160
all the curves. It's also worth noting you can save multiple editor layouts depending on the task.

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.600
So you could set up these windows for a certain type of task and then save a different layout

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.920
for maybe when you're editing content within an environment. So this is a setup that we'll use

7
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.320
to display the curves and also the Sequencer on the bottom. So essentially, Sequencer allows for

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.120
the trimming, editing, and manipulation of keyframes and animation curves captured with

9
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.680
Take Recorder. So anything from the virtual camera, which we saw an example of previously,

10
00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.240
where we're using Live Link to capture virtual camera data, it moves to rig inversion animation

11
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.840
derived from recorded performance capture data. And then the performance capture takes the control

12
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.400
rig animations, the virtual camera movement, the live foley, and other Take Recorder assets

13
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.840
can all be edited and layered together in-engine with the use of the Sequencer tools such as

14
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.560
the Curve Editor. So we can really dial in from the captured performances exactly now what we want

15
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.160
to create almost like we're creating it in post, but we have access to all the preserved keys to

16
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440
manipulate any content that we need to. And especially with all the recorded tracks that we

17
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.520
captured in the Take Recorder, we have access to all the extra data there. And then we can finalize

18
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.480
recordings in the Sequencer editorial tools. There's plenty of documentation on Sequencer

19
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.760
if you want to get familiar with how you might operate inside of Sequencer and how to set up

20
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.920
shots. But essentially, you can save the takes as a new level sequence, and then the level sequence

21
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.800
can be your sub-scene tracks. So we can set the camera binding ID in the camera cuts. So you can

22
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.160
see in the properties here, we can find the camera binding, we can create sub-scene tracks

23
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.680
in Sequencer, and we can add a V-cam track into the timeline and adjust the shot for a final edit.

24
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.720
You can either move around the shot durations in the timeline here, or you can even say about a

25
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.480
section, a range, end, and start. So plenty of options with Sequencer to really dial in the

26
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.600
performances that you've captured. And there's other courses recorded for you to look at with

27
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.440
Sequencer. And also you can find some great documentation.
