  "text": " So in this part of the course, we're going to be looking at the introduction to Lumen, where we're going to break down what it is and how it works. So let's get started. First up, many will ask, what is Lumen? So Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflection system. It's designed for next generation consoles, default global illumination, and reflection system. Now, keep in mind, it doesn't have to be just for games. This can also be done for Final Pixel, as well as VR training or simulation. So it works pretty well now and works really great with those venues. Not dependent, unlike ray tracing, on having the latest machine, but higher settings are GPU expensive. So you have to keep those things in mind. And I'll point those out later on in the course. Lumen renders diffuse inter-reflection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections in large detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. So it's really efficient. It really tries to help you get the best look that you can. And I'm going to walk you through some of the tools and how to get things in the right direction. So also, what is it? Now, many people will ask, how does this work compared to the old versions of Unreal? If you are used to or understand the old versions of Unreal, where you would bake your light. But in Lumen, we're getting an update on the fly. We're getting our global illumination and the photon calculations back at the camera being sent back there so that we're getting a nice, clean, updated, realistic scene. So diffuse indirect lighting, Lumen GI, light bounces and color bleeds is what it represents. So Lumen also provides infinite diffuse bounces overall. Unreal Engine 5's Nanite visualized geometry allows geometry to be much more detailed. And Lumen achieves a full resolution shading while computing indirect lighting cheaper than before. So it actually is really efficient. Sky lighting is solved as part of Lumen's final gather process. It includes sky shadowing, allows indoor space to be much darker than outdoor lighting, and have much more of a natural effect. Lumen also provides lower quality global illumination for lit translucency and volumetric fog. So we've really thought about how to optimize this and get it the best possible tool for your lighting needs. And it works really, really great. Lumen emissive materials, though, can be expensive. And we're going to go and take a look at Unreal. I'm going to point out a few things with that, as well as we're going to look at the settings that you have at your fingertips in the project settings and in the post-process volume. You see, emissive materials propagate light through Lumen's final gather with no additional performance cost. It's pretty awesome. But you can run into trouble when you have small pieces of geometry that you want to glow. There may be noise, and it may not be accurately represented. So there's a limit. So you have to keep things in mind. And you can see the note here. It says, however, there's a limit to how small. So again, emphasizing that, be careful as you do that. You might want to actually have a physical light attached to an object, or maybe even have some sort of pre-baked system in there and brought in and lighting things via vertex and via texture if they really are small and really need to be accurate. But for the most part, you can use Lumen when it comes to emissive materials, as long as you keep those things in mind. So Lumen solves indirect specular or reflections for full range of material roughness values. And it works really well. Now, you might get noise every once in a while dealing with your roughness and your materials. That is always something to keep in mind when it comes to updating GI on the fly. But you have several CVars. And you can see in some of our documentation that will help clean up some of that. And I'm going to point you to some of the CVars that you can work with. Diffuse GI and shadowed skylight can be seen in all reflections. And Lumen reflections also support clear coat materials, which is a really added plus, because then you're getting your updates on the fly. And you can control your materials and make things work really great. So what does it replace working with Lumen? It replaces skylight with AO or unshadowed. It replaces screen space global illumination. It replaces ray tracing GI. And third party GI solutions, such as NVIDIA's RTX GI. So let's talk about how to set it up. And I'll also point out about getting things to be emissive in your scene. So we have a scene here that has Lumen. This is the one that we used earlier. But let's talk about how to set up a scene. Now, we have project settings here. This is where we're going to initially set things up and get it in the right direction. So I'm going to open this up. In your project settings, you want to scroll down and go to Rendering. In Rendering, we're going to scroll down a bit more. And we're going to make sure that we have a dynamic global illumination method set to Lumen. Now, it should be on by default. But there are a few things you do need to edit. And also, if you're grabbing something from the marketplace, I'm going to point out some things to keep in mind. You'll notice the reflection method right now is Lumen. Now, in the post-process volume, you can change some of these if you need. And I'll point those out later. But for now, we're going to keep things all Lumen. We have a ray lighting mode here. And you'll see that it says Hit Reflection or Surface Catch. Hit gives you a bit more accuracy. And Surface Catch is a little bit lower in quality. So you have to keep those things in mind, what you want and what kind of hardware you're working with, as well as what you have in your scene. You'll notice our shadows are always going to be virtual shadow maps. That is what works with Lumen and is the ideal setting to set. You'll notice, too, our software ray tracing mode. We can do detail tracing or global tracing. One, obviously, is cheaper than the other. Detail tracing is a lot higher than global tracing. And you can choose that based, again, on your scene and what you're working with under the hood in your computer. You'll notice also we have Use Hardware Ray Tracing when available. This is important to turn on. If you have the ability to be able to run that. You also want to make sure under Hardware Ray Tracing, you have Supports Hardware Ray Tracing. Also, this needs to be turned on if you have it available. It is very helpful to keep these on because they will then support as you're working with Lumen and get things to calculate and update on the fly. They give you the best possible results. Now, you'll hear me mention this again in the class. But I'll emphasize this now. And I'll repeat myself later. When it comes to Lumen, Nanite, and virtual shadow maps, they're like the three musketeers. They really were made to work together. So it's very important when you are building your scene to not rule out working with Nanite because it will give you the best, most realistic geometry. But also, virtual shadow maps will complement that realistic geometry to give you the best possible results for your shadows. And then Lumen will give you the best possible results for your lighting. All those work really great together. Now, we talked about emissive. If we go over here, you'll see there are some emissive lights. These are pretty decent size. So this isn't going to be too much of a trouble. But if I had a smaller piece of geometry, and I want to make it glow, the accuracy might be an issue. You'll notice we are getting a little bit of noise here. You'll notice from our point light here, we're not getting much noise. It's pretty clean. But over here with this emissive material, we may be getting a bit of noise. So what you can do in that case, you'll notice even if I increase the size, the noise may persist and not necessarily go away. There are C-vars to be able to clean some of that up. And I can also go into the material itself and decide that I want to edit some things such as roughness and a few other items. And I'm going to repeat myself later in the course. So as you lower your roughness, you can see some of the noise goes away as you keep it clear. But as you increase the roughness like it does with, like what happens with ray tracing, you can end up getting a bit more noise. You can also flatten it out and make it so there's even no noise whatsoever. But as soon as you hit that middle ground, just keep things in mind with your materials. How you want that material to be represented, because noise may try to creep in. You also want to make sure that you're using Shader Model 6. Now, this is more important if you're getting stuff off the marketplace, because by default, Shader Model 6 should be on. If you're not sure how to get there, let me show you how to get there in Unreal. In Unreal, you go to your project settings. You can simply type in SM6. And you'll see that Shader Model 6 is working. And you'll see that Shader Model 6 is ready to go. Now, I'm going to turn mine on, and it's going to reboot. And when it does, that's going to actually give me the best possible results for my virtual shadow maps, as well as going to make it so that my visualizers for Lumen, Nanite, and virtual shadow maps are working correctly. So let's go ahead and turn that on. So I've turned that on, and it's restarted. Awesome. That's great. So we got things working in the right direction. With our Lumen scene. Now, we talked about in the project settings how we have to make sure Lumen is on, that we can control a lighting mode, software ray tracing mode, and we also make sure that things are supported by however ray tracing. You'll notice in here that you also can, and you'll notice what I mean is you can notice in my notes, that it says in the post-process volume, you can edit some of these settings, which is really great. And again, also by default, your generate mesh distance fields will be on. Now again, if you're grabbing something from the marketplace, you want to step through and make sure these things are on. Let me show you. So in my project settings, I'm going to pop that up. In here, I'm going to type in, generate mesh distance fields. And you want to make sure that's on, especially if you're getting things from the marketplace, that may be a little bit older and may not have these things on. But by default, working with a Lumen scene, these should be active. We also want to make sure for better AO built into Lumen, we want to make sure we are not using the old default. To turn these settings off, you want to go into your project settings and you want to make sure that you allow static lighting and ambient occlusion static fraction AO bake lighting are off. So let me show you that. So let's go back into those project settings. And we're going to say allow static lighting. You want to turn that off. And we also want to make sure that allow ambient, make sure I type in incorrectly. I should say ambient, not allow on this one. Then our ambient occlusion static fraction is also off. You're going to make sure those two are off. In the next section, we're going to look at quality control, some advanced settings and some tips and tricks when working with Lumen.",
