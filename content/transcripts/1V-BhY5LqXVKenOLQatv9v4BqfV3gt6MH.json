  "text": " All right, physical animation. I'm going to hop into the engine pretty quickly in this video. But just to recap, last time we manually turned on the physics behavior by changing settings in the details panel. And this time, we are going to take things a bit further and we will be using blueprints to dynamically turn on the physics for the third person character. And just a reminder, blueprints are just the visual node based assets that help you script behavior. So to get to the third person character blueprint, go to third person BP Blueprints. Double click on third person character. All right, so you might be in one of these other tabs like the construction script or the viewport, but just find your way over to the event graph. We're looking at a lot of movement behavior, so if you were to disconnect all of these wires, you would not be able to move the character with a mouse or keyboard or any other input controllers for that matter. So let's just right click pan, find an empty spot. And the first thing we need to do is find a node that will tell the engine, hey, do whatever that I'm going to tell you to do, but do it as soon as we hit the play button. And that is called, if I right click, type in event begin, and you should find the event begin play node. And then after that, if we drag off of the execution wire, we want to find a node that will turn on the physics, right? So let's type in simulate physics. And we have a couple different options. So how do we know which one to use? So the set all bodies, simulate physics that will turn physics on for every single bone. And our character will just flop to the ground immediately and we won't be able to run around. It will be funny and very interesting, but not useful. Instead, we want the set all bodies below. And when it says below, it means below a certain bone. And I'll show you that. So go ahead and click on settle bodies below, simulate physics. And there's this mesh that is being targeted. And it says mesh and it happens to be the same mesh in our component list. In fact, if I go to the viewport tab, our character is highlighted, which is good. So let's go back to the event graph. And the next thing is to drag off of the in bone name, type in make literal name. And what that allows you to do is type in the name of the bone that you want to have physics. So I'm going to type in clavicle underscore L because I want to add floppy physics to the left arm. And it will not just manipulate the clavicle, it will also affect all of the children underneath it. And the include self checkbox is on. So that means that we will include the clavicle L bone on the left side. If we were to uncheck it, it would just be all of its children underneath. And then we need to check on new simulate and that's saying, hey, turn on the physics. All right. So let's do that again. And I'm going to right click drag all bodies below, simulate physics. And it went ahead and grabbed the mesh for me. Great. Because I want to not just have a floppy left arm. I want a floppy right arm as well. So I'm just tidying up these nodes here, giving them a little more space. And then I'm going to duplicate the literal name node by clicking on it and hitting control W. And this way, I just have to type in one little change. I went ahead and connected it. And instead of underscore L, let's make it underscore R for the right side. And then just make sure you check on new simulate. All right. Now before we hit play, there's one more thing we have to do. Let's go to the mesh from the component list on the left. And we're looking down to the collision section. And we want to change the collision preset to ragdoll. Otherwise nothing will happen. And you might be tempted to check on the simulate physics checkbox again. But these nodes are doing it in a way that's more specific and is useful. And the character doesn't just flop down to the ground. So let's do it this way. So hit compile, save, go back to third person example map. And I believe in our last demo, we were in simulate mode. So let's change that to selected viewport. And then we have two floppy arms and our character is still falling from the sky. All right. Hit escape. So if I reset my camera, let me click in here and hit three because I've got a little camera bookmark and hit escape. There we go. Cool. Now if we want, we can record this too. So I can take my third person character and add source from actor, add third person character. And I'll go ahead and add the spheres because I had to do a restart. So I'm just going to add the spheres. You'll just get to see this one more time. I'll click on my SK mannequin, add him as well. Great. So now here's what we're going to do. We're going to hit play, hit F8 so that I can switch my mouse and hit record. Then I'm going to hit F8 one more time and then I'll actually be able to drive my character around and go from there. So just have your finger on the F8. We're going to hit play F8, record F8. And now I'm recording all of this floppy interaction. So I'm bumping into the character, I'm playing soccer, running into the wall. Okay I'll hit escape. And then if I look at the last recording and I hit play, there he goes running around. But this time there's actually a camera that was recorded because there's a camera in the third person character. So if I click the lock viewport to camera cuts, I can look through that camera and see what it's seeing. So a little chaotic, kind of floppy, but you've got that information, you recorded it. So have fun with that and in the next video we will adjust the different physics influences on each arm and blend it with our animations and even fire off some impulses for our character to react to.",
