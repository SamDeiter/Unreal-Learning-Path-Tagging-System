  "text": " Thanks again, everyone, for being part of these classes. We talked about building your world out, deciding how you want to pack things if you're to use a one-texture approach. We looked at blocking things and getting them in play using several actors such as Blueprint or even Parenting and so forth. We looked at all the different aspects of our tools such as adjusting your construction script and using Nanite resources in your scene. We also talked about packed level actors and level instancing, as well as looking at PCG's, how to approach all your different aspects of your scene and your tools with lighting and finally looking at materials and breaking things down for tips and tricks. I hope you've enjoyed this series of classes and they'll help you on your journey to build stronger, better, awesome, even awesomer more games. Keep us all informed about your progress because we'd love to hear it. Thanks again.",
