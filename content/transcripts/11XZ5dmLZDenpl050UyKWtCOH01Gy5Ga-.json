  "text": " Hello and welcome to MetaHuman DNA Calibration and Finalization. My name is Gabriella Croussani-Otakis and I will be your host for this course. This course is a continuation of the MetaHuman Fitting and DNA Calibration course. We will delve into more advanced use case scenarios for using the DNA Calibration library to modify the MetaHuman neutral pose and explore workflows for integrating it with a custom MetaHuman body. We will also dive into best practices for finalizing MetaHuman customizations in Unreal Engine. It is worth mentioning that with newer Engine versions, some of these workflows have changed and we will explore the new workflows in a future update. Now, let's take a look at what we will be covering in this course. We will get started by touching upon advanced use cases where DNA calibration has been used to make changes to the MetaHuman head and body. One case is the 2023 Unreal Fest DNA Calibration deep dive, and the other is how the stylized character Atomic Savage was customized with multiple workflows using DNA calibration. We will then look at all of the steps that were taken to customize Atomic Savage from the initial concept to the finalized rig. From there, I will break down some of the workflows in greater detail and walk you through how you might apply these workflows to your own characters. The first workflow we will delve into includes a modified version of the Unreal Fest calibration script. We will go over how to edit the MetaHuman neutral pose by transferring the details from the fitted head geometry assets that we looked at in the previous course to a MetaHuman identity, and then save those changes to the MetaHuman DNA file. For the second workflow, we will go over how we can merge the modified MetaHuman neutral pose with a custom MetaHuman body for seamless integration. From there, we will go through all of the steps for bringing the customized assets back into Unreal Engine with a hands-on exercise. We will go over how to re-import the head LOD FBX files, update the MetaHuman DNA file and the MetaHuman blueprint, and then we will look at how to import and assign a custom MetaHuman body skeletal mesh. We will then wrap up this course with some final recommendations, and I will share some tips and resources for you to use as you continue your training with MetaHumans. This course will be using the project MEH-9130055, and the level map should load automatically. The map is located in the Content Browser under the courses folder labeled MEH-31301 in the course maps folder, and it is named MEH-31301-Map-EX for example. This map contains the non-modified version of the Atomic Savage character, and we will be using this map to configure all of the customizations we will be bringing into the engine for the hands-on portion of our course. If you want to inspect the fully assembled version of this character, that is located under the course folder named MEH-21302 in the course maps folder, and it is named MEH-21302-Map-C for customized. Now all of the scripts and assets we will be using throughout this course are located in the source files folder of our course named MEH-31301-DNA-Calib Assets. Inside of that folder you will find two scripts and their associated assets, and in the folder named PoseDriverConnect you will find the RBF solvers that we will bring into the engine later on. If you need to reference the location of the course map, that can be found at the beginning of the slide deck after the training outline. Now as we go through this course, you will find that many slides in this presentation contain a lot of information, and I will summarize all of that for you, but if at any point you want to read what is on each of those slides, feel free to pause and dive right in. Now let's get started with the first portion of this course where we look at some advanced use case scenarios for making changes to the metahuman face and body using the DNA calibration library.",
