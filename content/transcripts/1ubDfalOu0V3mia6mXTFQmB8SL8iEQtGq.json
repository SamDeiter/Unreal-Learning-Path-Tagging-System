  "text": " Now we've gone through all the different sections of the interface, we'll be ready to do some actual coding and see about creating and connecting up some nodes. Now here we are in the event graph, in the example actor that we've made. Now we have three different red nodes, each of these represent an event. What they are is a starting point for when you're going to run some code, which would be triggered by the engine depending on what they are connected to. So over here we have the event begin play, the event actor begin overlap and the event tick. Now let's work with the event begin play first. If I was to drag off and add in a print string afterwards, this is a simple node which is going to print the word hello when it is fired. Now if I compile this, jump back into the engine, I'm going to make sure that we have show stats ticked here just so that we can make sure that we can see the messages in the viewport. Now if I push play, you can see that we have hello in the top left hand corner here. Now that's because this script will, anything that's connected to this script will trigger when the actor is either spawned into the world or when the program starts right to begin play. Now I'm going to drag this down and connect it to tick. I'm going to press compile and jump into the engine again. Now when I push play, you'll see that we have a long stream of hellos down the left hand side. Now that is because this tick event will trigger where every frame of the game. So if you're running at 60 frames per second, that is going to run 60 times per second. Now we have one other one that we are going to check out here and that is the construction script. Now if I was to do the same thing here and compile, you will now see if I grab our actor and move it in the world, show stats on, move it in the world, these go away. You can see that this will trigger on all of the movements. So this is great for if you wanted to randomize an asset when it was placed in or you wanted to do some kind of computation looking at the world when it is placed into the world. That means that the load from the script is done at construction time and saved to the actor rather than at runtime when a lot of other things might be firing. So again what we have here is we have the event begin play. This will be triggered one time when it first starts off. We have the event begin overlap. We're going to ignore that. We're going to do this in a different way slightly later on. We have the event tick. This triggers on every single frame of the game by default. So be very, very careful what you place on this. You can actually control it by coming into the class defaults and changing the settings for the tick here. You can either turn it off or reduce the speed of it. And then finally we have construction script. Construction script will fire on the point of construction. So now let's go over the different ways that you can add nodes to the event graph. What I'd like to do is go over the three different most common ways I think that you'll come across here in order of least used to most. Now the first the first way I'd like to go over is something called the palette. Now if we go up to windows and select palette in the drop down, this won't be turned on by default. You'll see that we'll get a window on the right hand side. And this is going to have two sections. So the top, this is going to have your favorite, your favorite nodes. And below this is going to have a searchable library of all of the different nodes that you can come across. Now in order to bring these in, all you need to do is select one, hold down the left hand mouse button and drag it onto the event graph. You can see here I've just pulled a branch over. And again I'm going to remove this by pushing delete. Now this is quite useful and it's good if you want to search through everything. But it tends to be a little slow when we're programming. The second way to get nodes into the chart is via the hotkeys. Now there are a few standard hotkeys which will come default with the engine when it's installed. You can actually go in and update and change them yourself. But the default ones are, if you hold down a B you'll get a branch, if you hold down a D you'll get a delay, if you hold down S you'll get a sequence, if you hold down G you'll get a gate, if you hold down an N you'll get a do N times, and if you hold down an O you'll get a do once, and then for M you'll get a multi gate. Now I'm not expecting you to know what all of these would do, but the important thing to understand with these is they're mostly flow control. So these are mostly going to allow you to control the method of execution. Now the most common flow control node that you're going to come across is going to be the branch node. And now if we look at a branch node, you'll see on the left hand side of this we have a red pin. This denotes a condition that is a Boolean condition. Now we'll go over variables in a second, but a Boolean variable is a zero or a one. This would denote true or false usually, with zero being false and one being true. And now you can see with this flow control, we would have an execution pin coming in from the left here. And then if the condition was set to true, this would trigger anything that was connected to the true pin. If the condition was set to false, this would trigger whatever was connected to the false pin. So this is the equivalent of an if statement, if you would be working within other programming languages. Our final way of generating nodes is going to be by right hand clicking in the background. Now what you'll see is we have a box that appears, a search box. Now if I was to search for example branch, you'll see that it will bring up branch. Now it's also quite smart as well. So if I was to search for if, it will also bring up branch as a selected. Which is because it knows that if you're working in coding, if you type in if, you probably want a branch statement. And at this point, if I was to just press enter, it's going to create it at the point where I clicked on the screen. Now this is even more useful than other methods, because if you look in the top right hand corner here, we have a tick box that's called context sensitive. Now what this means is this is only going to return values for nodes which would be compatible with the context you're in. So at the moment, this is only going to return any of the nodes which could be placed on an event graph. Now if I untick this, it's actually going to reconfigure this and it's going to return Every single node which is part of the system or that you've created or other part of plugins and this can be quite useful if you're searching for something very, very specific, you might want to turn this off and then you can do a more thorough search. However, with context sensitive on, this is going to help you find the right nodes that you want to get hold of. So for example, if I was to drag in a cube, so this is a reference, this is a variable is a reference to the cube component that I have here. If I was to drop this, it's going to give me an option to get or set. Now I'm going to get the cube. Now if I was to hover my mouse over the input pin, the output pin for the cube, drag off Now you can see here actions taking a static mesh component object reference. So this is going to limit everything that's reported in here to only things which would take a component, a static mesh component as an input. So if I come in here and I now type in destroy, you will see I get two options. I get destroy component and is component being destroyed. So if I was to then select destroy component, you'll see it's going to create a node and it's automatically going to link this up. Now, let's compare that to if I right hand clicked here and I typed in destroy. You'll see I get a lot of different nodes. I get a destroy actor, event destroyed. And here is the destroy component. It's harder to find the appropriate one that I'm looking for, where previously I would just get a single one and I know that it would connect up. So this context sensitive is really, really useful in order to limit what you're seeing to only stuff that you can actually use. So that way you've got that is the most common method for getting hold of nodes and adding them into adding them into the. There is also something to be said for copying and pasting. Now, if I wanted to, if I got nodes like this and I wanted to copy them and all I need to do is use the standard computer clipboard. So with these highlighted, if I press a control C, I can then move to another another place, press control V. And you'll see that it's going to create those nodes just by what is copied there. Now, we can also use other methods. For example, if I was to press control F X, I was to press control X, it'll take everything. And again, if I press control B, I can then paste them anywhere. That's because when you copy and paste these, they're saved to the clipboard as a as a text value. Now, one more option that we have here is with it highlighted, if I was to press control D, the duplicate is going to copy whatever I have highlighted at that time. It's just a useful method of doing things. Now, let's talk about connecting these up. So as you can see here, I have three branches. I'll say I wanted to connect this up to the event begin play. I can drag off of this execution pin and you'll see as I move the cursor over the input pin on the branch, I get a little green arrow. And that means that if I drop that, it's going to allow me, it's going to connect that up. Now, I can do so, say for example, I was to do that here. Now, if I wanted if I wanted to disconnect this and connect it up here, I can do that by floating over either of these pins, holding down the alt key and left clicking. And that's going to disconnect that. Something else I can do is if I was to hover over one of these keys, hold down the control key, you'll see that this changes into a small little hat. If I left click, I can now drag that to reconnect to other locations. So with this video, we know how to bring in, move around and connect up nodes. In the next one, we're going to start talking about variables.",
