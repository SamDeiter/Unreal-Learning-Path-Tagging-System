  "text": " It's all well and good, we've got the door opening and closing but what happens if we wanted to actually use the door handle to open the door? What if we wanted to walk over to the door and we didn't want it to automatically open but we wanted to say okay I want to open this door maybe by pressing the E and to right. So let's think about how we might do that. So in Unreal Engine we can go to edit and we've got project settings here and these project settings are anything that's relevant to your current project. So we're just going to go ahead and click that and I'm going to scroll down, there's a whole host of things that we can do here but let's scroll down to input. So input is underneath the engine heading, under input and let's look at action mapping. So let's expand this list here, you'll see a list of pre-built things and this is where Unreal Engine have added certain inputs to the game, it allows you to run around and jump and shoot and so what we want to do here is we want to add an interaction key. So we're going to go to action mapping so we're going to click the plus button. So we've got a new action mapping here, let's call this interact. Let's also select a key for this, I'm just going to press E on my keyboard and scroll down and I'm going to find the E input here. So whichever button you'd like to do, again bearing in mind that the button is not already used I'm going to click and select E there and that's all we really need to do there. So we can shut the project settings now, we've got a blueprint door, I'm just going to make sure I compile and save again just to make sure everything is there. I'm going to right click and I'm going to type interact now. Now what we can see is we've got action events called interact. Now if we had called that interact something different like if we had called that zebra, you would right click and search zebra and that directly correlates to what input we clicked. So whenever we press the E key now, interact will fire. Now there's going to be inherent issue with this, we want to make sure that it's only when we're near the door that we press E that it works. So let's just disconnect the reverse key. So we're just going to hold alt on our keyboard and left mouse click. Alternatively you can right click, break all links. So you can either right click on a pin and break all links. I like to hold alt on my keyboard and left click. Let's move this down here. Let's add some space here and we're going to do our first get. So we're going to right click and get player controller. So get player controller. So we just right clicked an empty space, get player controller and we're going to drag off there and we're going to type enable input. So enable and select. So again make sure you drag off the return value. We're going to enable input. And I think, yeah I think, let's see where we end up here. If you've got the target and the player controller is empty, I'm going to hold control and left mouse drag and drag it down there. So that just allows you, by holding control on the keyboard it allows you to move something. For example you just want to break the link and add it again. That's fine as well or you can right click, break link. I think it should go into player controller. Let's see where we end up, that might end up biting us later on but let's see. So I want to disable input from here and again I'm going to move it there. So I'm going to go to enable, disable. I'm going to compile and save, just make sure we're working. And when we do input I'm going to play this. So when we talked about debugging before actually, this is a good thing to implement. So when we're speaking about debugging and seeing the wires happening, a good way as well is if we drag out of pressed and type print. So we'll select the first one, print string. And you'll see a string here. So I'm just going to type input. And what we'll see here if we compile and save, when the player presses a button this should fire on the screen and it should say input on the screen. And it allows us to detect if things are working without seeing the flow. So let's just go ahead and test this out. Let's see if that player controller did actually do what it should have done. So input you see on the top left of the screen there. I'll just play again for you just to make sure you can see that. And so the doors not opening. I press E on the keyboard and just look at the top left of my screen in the actual viewpoint. You see input fire and therefore that's worked. Okay, that's good that we know that that now works. We've got a print string on the screen. We're using the input. Now the only other thing we really want to do here is the doors not closing. So we could drag this down to here to reverse and that will then close our door. So let's go to compile. Let's go to save. We'll go back into our map. And again now we're just really adding flavor. We're adding functionality to our door. So we just pressed. We're going to press E now. We've got input. The door stayed open when we move away from the door. When we move away from the door. There we go it closes. So that's really nice functionality. The door doesn't open by default. We press E. We open the door. The door closes when we leave it. If I escape out I just want to now clean up this blueprint. I don't really need that print string there. I can just hit delete. Make sure you create play here. And the only thing that I'd really want to do now is to add a little bit more complexity. Again this is optional. If you're feeling comfortable with where you're at right now this is more optional. But I really don't like these wires. You can imagine spaghetti starting to ensue in our blueprint if we leave wires just dangling all over the place. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to introduce the concept of a custom event. So I'm going to alt click that wire. Again you could right click, break link or you could alt click. I'm going to right click here. I'm going to type custom and custom event. So again just custom, custom event. I just added an E there just to start event. So custom event. I'm going to say close door. So I'm going to create a custom event called close door. I'm going to reverse on the close door. Now I'm going to compile and save. I definitely need to compile now. This is a compile behavior so if you're not compiled definitely do that. And I'm going to drag off here. I'm going to type close door. Now you'll see the close door is the exact same of this. So again if I called that zebra you type zebra here. Click close door and compile, save. Now this is going to send a message from here to there just through the user custom event. If I double click this close door you'll see that it selects that. So again double click here and it selects that. So you'll see the flow will go from disable input. It'll send a message from there to there and then it'll close the door. And it just in my mind it keeps things a lot cleaner. Just before we leave I'm going to select everything. I'm going to press C on my keyboard to comment and I'm going to call this open, let's say open close door functionality. And it just keeps things nice and organized. I'm even going to give it a little color. I'll give it a pinkish color. I'm going to change my alpha value maybe to 0.2 so it drops down the opacity a little bit. I'm going to click OK. Maybe I want to change my font size to 30. Again if the box isn't selected I wouldn't be able to change that. I want to click the box. Now I have those options. And these things up here are getting in my way a bit. I don't really need them so I'm just going to delete them. Now we have basic open close door functionality. The main thing we want to check now is that this function fired into this event. We just want to make sure everything is working. So let's compile. Let's save. Let's run through our door again. Let's make sure we take our weapon this time. Things may have appeared since we last tested it. Let's walk over to the door. The door is not opening. Let's press E. We're through the door. We can shoot whatever is happening and the door shuts behind us.",
