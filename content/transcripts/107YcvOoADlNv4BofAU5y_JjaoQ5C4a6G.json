  "text": " Hi everyone. In this lesson, we're going to go and take a look again at the subsurface materials and all the details that we can create from a simplistic ice type of effect to one that's a little bit more complex. So let's get started. We saw in the last lesson how we can create a fernel index node inside of our opacity as well as our subsurface inputs and we actually could get some pretty good effects. Now, this doesn't actually have to be really complex. It can be pretty simple which I'm going to show you in just a second. But you can also add a bit of complexity with a world alignment texture node which allows us to be able to blend things such as the subsurface textures as well as even the normals which actually work really well, which I do show you in another class. But in this particular case, let's go and take a look at each one of these and how we can create some really great things. Now, you also could use a more complex fernel index if you wanted to and it gives you a breakdown here of exactly what each one of those inputs to. Do you need it? Not necessarily. Sometimes less is more. But you do have the option of getting a cheap contrast, dark and light if you want or dark and bright. But that's really up to you as well as you can invert the effect if you needed to as adjusting things also with a camera vector or a normal vector, which is nice. But we're not going to get into this particular one. We do talk a bit about this in previous classes. But for the most part, I'm going to show you exactly what we can do. Keeping things even low-key or even a bit more complex, you can go in any direction when it comes to Unreal. Your possibilities are endless on what you can create. You can see several versions I have here using that same complex version I made for Jade, allowing me to control my subsurface opacity as well as my subsurface look and feel. You can see some really great effects here. Let's go ahead and jump into Unreal and take a look at some things. With this particular ice, you'll see that it looks pretty great and actually works really well. As I move my light around, you can see the effect of the edge here being affected with our light, and it seems to be working really well. It's using a bit of that for an L-index information to get what we need. Let's actually click on this up close and take a look at some things. We're going to go and click on that new ice, and you'll notice this is really simple. Again, we are using the subsurface material shading model. In here, we simply just have a normal punched in and opacity. You'll notice you don't necessarily have to have a Furnut L-index for your opacity, but it can help with that bending effect of the light and that making things look either glass or ice-like, it's up to you. Here, I just have a simple opacity control, but that can change. Again, you can imitate what I did with the jade and that effect to be able to actually push things in the direction that you need, and you'll see a simple Furnal Index. Now again, we have several different Furnal Indexes like we talked about before that we can use. Now you'll notice there's a Furnal function. That's the one that I pointed out just a minute ago in the slides. If I click on this, you can see this one has a lot more you can do it. If I wanted to, I could use this also as an output for my subsurface profile, as well as punching it into my opacity. We can use a normal vector, and here we can use a color information that we need, if we wanted to. You'll see here there's a V3 for a camera vector. We can use RGB information for positioning if we wanted to, and I'll show you what I mean. If I hit the 3 key here, I can punch this in right into our camera vector information. And if I wanted to, I could pull that right into my subsurface color. Now you'll notice it's whited it out because it's using RGB information to be able to gather things like an XYZ. It kind of translates that way. But if I go in here and change my color information, you'll actually see some things change within your scene. We'll choose something that may give us a bit more of a better output, but you'll notice it's very slight. You'll also see the light kind of change if we get a good angle there. As I run through this, we saw it just a second ago, you'll see the highlights kind of change, but it's really up to you how you want to do it. So let's actually hit, let's do yellow for now. You'll see an update. So we can choose, ooh, kind of cool, deep on the other side there, look at that color. So we can choose whatever we want, whatever color, and we do need a few more things to play with those. We do that up. See that update there? Pretty cool. So, and what I mean by that is we can actually go in here and say, hey, I want a normal vector. What is that going to be? And I can hit the three key again and pull in a normal vector and also change those values of what I want. We'll go more of a reddish pink color and hit okay. And you could see, you can get an infinite combo. And again, it's using that RGB information to be able to produce different looks and feels. It's really up to you how you want to do it. Cool, and you can get like even a deep rich tone to your ice if you wanted to. So you could see where this would play and work out pretty well. And we do talk a bit about this in other classes, but I just wanted to show you briefly how you can go from simple to complex by simply just adding a few more values. And again, we have some power control overall, which could be a scalar, as well as cheap contrast and so forth if we wanted to go in here and a cheap contrast dark. And you can simply just go in here and say promote to a parameter. And you're going to get that node that fits really well for cheap contrast. And you can get the idea of what you can do. It's pretty great. Cool, and those are static bullions if you're unfamiliar with the SB. Probably should mention that. All right, so let's go ahead and take a look at the other more complex ISO part to the side here. Now he's just slightly complex in the fact that we actually can use this in such a way. And I just duplicated a piece of ice here. I can shove it into another object and the subsurface alignment is working really well. Now there is no alignment node, world aligned texture node inside of the normal. So you're going to see a harsh line that will show up, but just the same as we use it for the subsurface, we can actually use it for our normals so that they blend a bit better. And we go over that in another class called world composition. But in here, let's go and take a look at how this ice is broken up. Let me go and pull this over. So in this particular environment, we see that we're using a world aligned texture and we're stacking them in such a way. We have an add, multiply and then an add, putting them in our scene and controlling the texture size. And we're putting that right in combo with a multiply, a subsurface color, a subsurface scale. And we're bringing that right into the subsurface color here. And that allows us to control the look and feel a bit more for that subsurface variety if we needed it. And if we instance these, we can make each one look a little bit different than the other. Now you do need to expose parameters when you do this. So what that means is you want to convert to a parameter here, as well as any other items such as your scalars, like you might want to convert this one too and say, hey, this is going to control overall alignment amount. And this one here, subsurface scale, which is already promoted. And then this one here could be just color amount here and you can convert that to a parameter. And when you create an instance, you'll be able to have access to those and edit those accordingly. Pretty great to be able to have this ability to be able to do this and to be able to control your subsurface and have all these things at your fingertips. So keep those things in mind. So that's it with this video. In the next video, we're going to go ahead and take a look at the parallax occlusion shader and what that means, as well as the bump offset and compare them from a more complex, which would be parallax, to a more simple bump offset and which one would be better and the ins and outs caveats for each. Thanks again.",
