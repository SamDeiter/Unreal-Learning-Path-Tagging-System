  "text": " So, we've talked a little bit about the simple code that you would use to get some of this stuff working, but it's worth actually looking at the editor itself. The easiest way to make a widget is through the actual Blueprint content flow. You can again make classes that inherit from these things in C++, but just as a quicker way to demonstrate it. If we go to... I'm just going to go into the 1.105 folder, because that's at least vaguely the right area. But you would go to User Interface here by right clicking, and go to Widget Blueprint. And then you're presented with a class selector, very much like when you're making an actor class, or well, just a new Blueprint, sorry. But you'll see that the hierarchy is slightly different. Again we've got our visual as our route, and then we have Widget, and again you'll note that neither of these two things are viable options to select from. It's only at the point that we select User Widget that we can actually create an instance of this class, and if we were then to select that, we would then get that new widget created for us. So if I just called this BP underscore My New Widget, although I say BP, actually the typical name convention would either be WBP for Widget Blueprint, or sometimes if you want to be a little bit more shorthand, W underscore for Widget. In my own work I've typically used W as the kind of, to say that this is a Blueprint only widget, and WBP to indicate that this is a Widget Blueprint that inherits from C++, from a C++ widget that isn't just User Widget, but is my own C++ class, but that is purely a my own workflow kind of thing, so that's not necessarily something you need to adopt yourselves. So just talking through the kind of window that we'll see when we first open our widget up, I will quickly do this just to kind of show you that we are talking about the same screen here, but it's kind of easier to go with the presentation when we've got this kind of markup on all of these sections. So right at the top of the section we've got our kind of standard toolbar, this is pretty much as we would expect to find really across all the engine, and most pieces of stuff to be honest, like our file edit section. Some of these things do apply are kind of semi-contextual, so they may have options that aren't necessarily available outside of UMG, so just kind of worth mentioning that. Underneath we've got the point where they start to get a little bit more specific to UMG. So we've got the toolbar, this contains a kind of number of common functions, we've obviously got our save, our search, compiling our blueprint, diff, so this is obviously only going to be relevant when we're connected to source control, but you can diff both blueprints and user widgets. It's actually got quite developed functionality, this didn't always used to be as good as it is now, but you can diff widgets quite successfully with each other, they're particularly good at diffing the code itself, the blueprint code. Changes to the actual widget hierarchy are represented, and you can see differences in like the values and any widgets you might have added, the visualisation of them isn't quite so developed, so it's not perfect, but it will get you a long way there and the information is definitely available to you there, so it's a lot more helpful than it not being there. Then we've got our standard play in editor. Next we have our drop down, so this would be familiar to anyone who's spent this time working with debugging actors, but this is just to select an instance, so if for example you're debugging a widget and there are two copies of that widget, because you're creating two health bars, one for each player, you could select which of the two health bars you're trying to debug at the moment. Then we have our widget reflector, which is a button that is unique to UMG, and it's worth just mentioning this because it's a very very powerful tool, I'll talk a little bit more about this, but it is worth checking this out, this is essentially a debugging tool that lets you debug what you're seeing at run time, I'll come back to this in a little bit, but just worth mentioning that there is a button to open up your widget reflector. It can also be done through a console command, which is, again we'll circle back to this towards the end of the presentation, but this is actually the example level from our networking course, but it's kind of not too important. If I just go to widget reflector and type that in our console command, you can also open the widget reflector this way, it's open on my other screen but you just have to trust me that opened. So yeah, we'll circle back to that. So that's our second section. In the top right we've got the switcher that lets us switch between our designer, which is the more UMG unique view where we're doing all the visual editing, and our graph view, which is going to look a lot more like our standard typical blueprint graph view, so if you spent any time editing blueprints, that graph is going to look a lot more like the other blueprints you would have worked in before. So it's going to have the same things exposed there, our functions, our variables, and really access to any of the kind of C++ behaviour, whether that's, you know, it would also be exposing any kind of C++ functionality or variables for any costs we might have inherited from there. Then on the back over to the left here we've got our fourth section, this is the palette. This is essentially, well as the name kind of implies, it's a palette of pre-made widgets that we can use to define the kind of structure, that we can build up a more complex picture for what our widget actually looks like. Really this will show anything that inherits from Uwidget. Some of the kind of common things is containers such as vertical and horizontal boxes, scroll boxes, overlays, borders, spaces, we've kind of already talked about a lot of these. It'll also contain any user generated widgets, so at the point that you make your own user blueprints, they will come out in their own section here. And yeah, I kind of think that's everything really to say about palette. Below the palette we've also got the hierarchy, so where palette is the kind of options available to us for the widgets that we can drag in, our hierarchy actually represents our current view of our widget as it is designed. So this is the kind of like the tree that defines how our widget is actually laid out. So kind of getting into the detail of the hierarchy is maybe something better done in live, but this would look a little bit similar to maybe if you've worked in DCC packages before or in your blueprint editor when you're adding scene components. This is in a hierarchy, so widgets can be inside of other widgets. It depends on the kind of widget type, whether or not a widget can have no widgets within it, whether it can have several or just one, but you typically, a kind of more complicated hierarchy would have several elements in it. In fact, if I just quickly jump over to a pre-existing example, so if I go to our health bar widget and I go to a segmented bar widget, oh that's too simple. Do I have any, oh I definitely do. If I go to focus navigation, this is what a kind of slightly more complicated hierarchy might actually look like, where you have, again, hierarchy being the key here, we've got these kind of drop downs for where widgets are socketed inside of other widgets. So we have a horizontal box containing several elements, we have a vertical box containing elements, you can even have a vertical box containing a horizontal box containing a scroll box, so we're not limited to one level of depth here, and you can infer that from the fact that we have everything inside a canvas panel, so we've already got at least three layers of depth here. So this is again just the editor time representation of how this widget might look. Obviously there's still the capacity here to add new widgets at run time, so this is only the more static version of this widget if you're adding things at run time, and that's obviously not going to be able to be reflected here. So I think that's our hierarchy. Then section six is basically just our visual designer, so this is a visual representation of everything that's in our hierarchy. Again just to quickly jump over, we can see for every widget that is represented in our hierarchy that is selectable and visualizable here, we have various settings to control this space, so this is a little bit like a canvas for us to drag things into, you can define things like the kind of size of this area by default, but yeah, just between the two of these, this is a little bit like our world eyeliner, whereas this is our kind of game viewport if we want to turn it into kind of a level editor context. And working between the two can be quite a potent way to navigate between things that either might be hidden or kind of just a little bit easy to kind of jump back and forth between finding things and then kind of clicking on the bits that are kind of visually relevant. And yeah, and then last of all we've got the details panel which will be familiar to anyone who's spent any time working in the world eyeliner or the level editor, and it does the kind of same job here. So for any item that you currently have selected, the details panel will display all of the bits of information, all of the variables about that particular widget in a kind of editable way. Typically for widgets, this might be things like colour pickers, this might be various values that you've set, bits of information relevant to the slots, we've already talked about this idea of... sorry, jumping ahead a slide, we've already talked about this idea of slots for panels, but it's just worth quickly touching on that actually, that when something that is kind of a little bit more different about UMG that you might not necessarily get used to is that when you're looking at any given widget, usually one of the first things you'll see is the slot. This is not information that is specific to this type of widget, the slot information is made available to it based on the widget that it is inside of. So this exact same... this is a... well, if I go to a text widget here for example, you can see that we've got the slot, which is a horizontal box slot. If I drag this text widget inside the canvas panel, now it doesn't have a horizontal box slot anymore, it has a canvas panel slot. So whereas the rest of the details panel is kind of talking about this widget itself, if this widget is inside a panel, which the vast majority of widgets are, the vast majority of the time, the first section tends to be describing the slot, which is information about the thing it is inside of and what capabilities it has to control the way it's laid out within that thing. So within the context of a horizontal box, you can say, is this thing trying to demand its own space? Is it trying to fill up all the space available? How much padding does it have from nearby content? Should it come from the slot that's been given to it? Should it try and lay itself out centred? Should it try and fill the entire space? Should it lay itself out vertically centred, etc. etc. etc. It very much depends contextually on what kind of panel it's inside of, for what information is available to it through the slot. And then last of all, we have the animation window. So this won't necessarily appear straight away. I think typically when you open the UMG editor, it's not actually going to be there, but it's just down here in this little drop down. So this is kind of an expandable window. This is a little bit like the content drawer, where if you press Ctrl Space, it will just temporarily open up. I think Ctrl Shift Space opens up the animation window. But if you are doing a lot of animation authoring, that can become a little bit irritating. There is also this dock-in layout, which will actually turn it into a kind of like a sticky window that will actually just perpetually sit in your editor, unless you then just choose to close that window. So this is where you would author any animations, where you would key various frames and just do all your animation layout functionality. We'll touch a little bit more on animations later. We'll circle back to that. So if we actually just quickly go through a demonstration of how one might actually use some of this stuff. We've got some GIFs here in the presentation, but I figure I might as well just do this live because it's a little bit easier. So we can see that it's very easy to kind of put content into a new widget. If I were to just go back to that new widget we've made. Like I said, we've got our palette here. We've got a couple of different options. Typically you would put in some kind of root panel, because normally the first thing you want in your widget isn't a widget that can't have anything else attached to it. It can have something attached to it. The kind of standard go-to is a canvas panel, because canvas panels give you a lot of control. It's just worth mentioning that canvas panels are about the least efficient widget to use. So one should be a little bit cautious about using them if you don't need to, but just for the purposes of demonstration it's quite an easy one to use. Canvas panels are essentially a panel that can have as many children as they like in the widget, but they also give that child a lot of control over how it's laid out within that widget. So if I were to take an image, and you can see I can either drag items from my palette into my hierarchy like this, or I can drag them out into my visual editor like this, and I'm kind of positioning it and adding it at the same time. A lot of the kind of standard shortcuts here work as well. So if I press Ctrl D that's going to duplicate it. I think by default it does tend to snap it to the top left, so that's just a little kind of like eccentricity that's worth bearing in mind. And then as you can see by editing this I'm affecting its slot, because canvas slots have a pixel coordinate from the top left of the screen, but you can also, I say the top left, there's also kind of like an anchor that says where, how do its coordinates describe itself in relation to a certain section of the screen. So you can use this in a way to say that this widget should always be in the centre of the screen exactly, you could set its anchor to the centre and have it at 0,0. There's a couple of additional things to bear in mind, like alignment, so if I said that this is aligned 0.5, 0.5, that would be truly in the centre. So yeah, worth experimenting, and a lot of these settings are going to be dependent based on what kind of panel you're working within, but canvas is the one that gives you the most control. It's easy to resize things and it gives you a lot of flexibility and control, but again, canvases are probably the most expensive widget to use, so they should be used with a certain degree of caution. And then yeah, we already talked about the fact that when we search over into our graph view we have something that looks a lot more like our standard blueprint code, we have a couple of nodes available to us, this is like, we'll talk a little bit more about what these actually do a little bit later, but where we would typically see our begin, play and tick when you're in UMG, this would actually be construct and tick, but we'll talk about those in a little bit more detail in a little bit.",
