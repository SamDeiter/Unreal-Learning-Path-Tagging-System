  "text": " Hello and welcome to this video. In this, we're going to carry on with the exercise and we are going to create a piece secondary branch to our behavior tree. And so I'll jump back into the engine. So I'm going to go back into our behavior tree. We're going to create a secondary path across here and I'm going to call this follow player. I'm going to drag off, I'm going to select another sequence and I will rename this to follow player. Okay, now we can build, we can put the tasks in in a second. But what we want to do is we want to have a way of making sure that we can choose which one of these paths we're going to move between. And what we're going to use in this case is if the player has been detected, we're going to use a service in order to figure this out. So I'm going to come up here and I'm going to do a drop down on service and I'm going to select BT service blueprint base. Okay, and we talked about service before. I'm going to call this S underscore is. Player close. And that's going to create another class, which is very similar to the tasks that we've been working on before. It's got eight overrideable functions. And for this, we're going to do everything on receive tech. And this is good because it's going to it's going to run on every tech and it's also going to allow us access to the controlled NPC poor. Okay, so we have something that looks a little bit like us. And what I'm going to do is the first thing I want to do is get the player character. So I'm going to type in get player porn. And to start off with, to prevent any errors, I'm just going to check to see if this is a valid porn. So I'll type in and go is valid porn. So that we've got a branch here and I'll plug that directly. Now we've got the control porn and I want to see the distance between these two and check to see if it's below a certain a certain value. So what I'm going to do is going to drag off of the controlled porn and I'm going to drag it off of the control porn. So what I'm going to do is going to drag off of the controlled porn and I'm going to go get actor location. Now give me a vector of where the actor is in the world. I'm going to do the same for the get player porn. So get actor location. I want to know the distance between these two. If I drag off and type in distance. You'll see that we have a function to measure the distance between two vectors. Well, that will return the value as a float. So I'm now going to push down B to bring up a branch and left click. And I want to check to see if this float is below a certain value. So I'm going to do less than and for this I'm going to use one hundred and fifty. And I'll plug this into the branch. So only if the player character is under one hundred and fifty centimeters from the the MPC. Will this do whatever we attach to true. And for this, we want to get some information out of this. So again, we're going to need to use a variable and I'm going to call this variable player. Going to make it instance editable by hitting this little I. And I want this to be a blackboard key selector. I'll drag this in. Drag off and go set blackboard value as object this time. And I'll plug that into true. And I will get the player get player porn. And we can be pretty sure this is valid seeing as we've checked just a little bit back. So that should be fine. Now with the service, you don't need the end execute because this is going to run regardless. And there's no sort of fail condition on this. It would just run. So I'm going to go compile and save. Now let's use this within our behavior tree. You jump back to our behavior tree. I've got my follow player. I'm going to drag off and I'm just going to add in a change color task. And that's so that we can see if this is working. I'm going to change that to red. So I'll put the red one and make sure the answer is a one as well. So we've got a red car. Now. I want to run this service. I'm going to add it to the selector here. So I'm going to write and click come down to add service. And I'm going to select is player close. Now that's going to run. You can see every point four or point six seconds. I can change the interval here, but I'm quite happy with it running that frequently. Now there is one thing I want to change. At the moment, by default, the player variable is going to be saved to the self actor blackboard key. We really want it to be saved to the player because that's what we're going to be using to determine how we move through the baby tree. Now there's one more thing that we need to add to get this to work. And that is on the wonder around. If you right hand click, come down. We want to add a decorator. And if you remember the decorators are what we use as filters. And this is what we can use to stop the behavior. She going down this path. So I'm going to come up. And I'm going to use the blackboard. Now I'll select the blackboard and I'm going to change the key query. I'm going to change it is not set and select player. So what this is saying is only do this if the player is not set. Right. So let's try this out. I'm going to push save. And I'm going to jump back into the leather. Here we go. We can see we've got all the different characters. And if I wander up to one, follow him around for a little bit. Should see that he turns red. So he's detected us and he is now going to turn red. There you go. You can see that one's turning red as well. Now this is an idea. And we can see here that the player is not detected. And that's because even though they are detecting the player, when we get close to them, it's waiting until the part the entire task is finished before it turns red. That's not what we want. We want them to instantaneously detect the player. So how do we do this? We can see that we have a blackboard decorator. And we can see that we have a blackboard decorator. So we can now wander about tasks as you select the blackboard decorator. Now at the top, we've got a flow control set. And we've got observer abort. Now we have no abort set at this point. So I'm going to do a drop down. I'm just going to change this to south. So as soon as I walk up to a character, as soon as it runs that service, it will abort the activity it's doing at that point. Okay. Now that's looking good. Let's make them do something else rather than just stand around. And that's quite straightforward because we've already written a lot of the code that we need for this. So we've changed the color. Let's come in here and change the speed next. And we're going to change the speed to set it to 400. So they're now running after the character. And the final instruction, we're going to use move to again. What we're going to do in this one is rather than move to the self actor, we're going to move to the player. Let's save that. So your entire chart should look a bit like this. And I'm now going to run. And as we detect the players, you can now see who the characters are going to chase the player that we've got. So there you go. We can collect up the NPCs as we move around. And with that, that brings us to the end of our behavior tree exercise. Next up, we're going to be looking at state trees and how they vary from the bad trees.",
