  "text": " Now that we know a little bit about what Niagara is and what we can use Niagara for, let's take a look at the Niagara Content Examples. This is a very valuable resource for anybody who is new or existing Niagara users. The Niagara Content Examples can be found in the Content Example Project, which you can download from the Sample section of the Epic Games Launcher. Inside of that project, you're going to find three Niagara maps. There's Niagara Particles, Niagara Advanced, and Niagara Fluids. Now, each one of these maps is going to show you different Niagara examples and setups. Niagara Particles is going to show you the most basic setup. Niagara Advanced is going to show you more advanced setups, and that's actually where we got all three of the examples and our What is Niagara slide that we saw previously. Then Niagara Fluids actually shows us how to set up both 2D and 3D gas and fluid simulations that utilize Niagara. One of the other great things about the Content Examples is that when you open up a particle inside of there, you're going to find very detailed comments about what is going on. In fact, this is just one of the many detailed examples that we will see. On this slide in front of us, this is taken right from one of the Content Examples, and we can see here it's explaining what everything else is doing as we go from the top down to the bottom, which is how particles are executed. Again, Niagara Content Examples is extremely valuable resource because not only does it show you how to do very simple things, very intermediate and very advanced, it also has very detailed comments that explain the how and why they're doing things, which is really valuable especially when you're trying to apply this to other projects.",
