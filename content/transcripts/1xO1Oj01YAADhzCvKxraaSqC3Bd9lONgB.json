  "text": " Now that we have all the theory of film and Unreal Engine out of the way, let's think about getting started inside of Unreal Engine, talking about projects, plugins and templates and how to get started inside of Unreal. So when you load up a new project from the Epic Games launcher, you can actually select a virtual production template from the film, video and live events tab on the left hand side that you see in that image there. So when you select the virtual production template, it enables several virtual production plugins, it gives you the static mesh color collaboration tool and also gives you a cine camera actor. So you can actually set that from the template and get access to the example maps as well, which you can see on the right hand side here. Now just as a quick note, if you, for example, started a game project or an architecture project or you didn't start the specific virtual production project, all of this content can be added to your project at a later stage. So if you already have some projects in the works and you wanted some of these tools, you can migrate them over inside of your project. So don't worry if you've selected a different template and you've got a certain way down and you've not selected virtual production, you can still migrate some of this content across. It just makes things easier to get up and running in the desired project that you want. So if you didn't have a virtual production template opened or that you just want to look at the plugins that are available to you inside of Unreal Engine to give you more customized functionality. When you have your engine open, you can go to edit at the top left hand side of your screen there and you can go down to the bottom and select plugins and you'll see this plugin window open. Now here's a list of all the different virtual production related plugins. Some of them may already be enabled inside your project. Some of them you may need to enable after the fact to get the functionality that you want, but they're all here and available for you to enable and disable as you see fit. Just a quick note, when you do enable or disable a plugin, you'll have to restart your editor So I'll prompt you to do that, but just so you know, you will have to restart your editor for any of these tools to take effect. And then let's just quickly go over the master level sequence and where to find that. At the top left hand side of your screen here, you can see that there's a button with a little cinematic actor there and you can add the master sequence from here. So a master level sequence, you can quickly create shots. Useful if you know how many shots you need from the start. Easy to organize. You can use previously created sequences to populate the shots and it's also a uniform shot creation. So settings can carry over from each shot. So here's an example of how you might set up the master sequence, the number of shots you might take, shot increments, what you would even like to call each shot. You can change the prefix of each shot if you want. Also change the duration. So if you know what you want the outcome to be from the get go, you can use this master level sequence or we can just create sequences after the fact. So it's fine whichever approach you take, but it's just useful to talk about the master level sequence in this content in case you know exactly straight off the bat what you need to set up in your project.",
