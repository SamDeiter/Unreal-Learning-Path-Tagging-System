  "text": " Hello, and welcome to this course on AI systems, Introduction to Navigation. We will be doing this course in Unreal Engine version 5.5. However, most of this hasn't changed for quite a few versions of the engine. So you should be OK working in previous engine versions, I think, all the way through five. Now in this, we're going to go over a number of different things. We're going to go over how to set up navigation and something called a NavMesh. We're going to look at methods of customizing it so that we can make the behavior respond to the environment that we've created. We're also going to have a go at making it dynamic so that it changes at runtime without having too much of a cost. And finally, we're going to look at different methods of getting the AI to avoid each other so they don't all get clumped up. So the first question, what is a NavMesh? Well, a NavMesh, or more common full name of a navigation mesh, is a simplified map of the walkable areas used in game. So what it is, is it is a map which is generated and created and modifiers are added to it. And it is laid over the world. And its primary function is just so that we can figure out a path of how to get from one place to another. So it shows us what the sort of walkable areas are. This is a standard method. It precalculates pathfinding, allowing the AI to navigate complex environments efficiently. So all that means is it will break down all of the environment into blocks and calculate the distance that will be required to move across them. Therefore, rather than actually having to analyze the environment every single time it goes in, we just need to run an algorithm against the table of generated blocks. And it will tell us the most efficient way to move through the environment. Now, it's not entirely realistic. Take, for example, we had a maze. Using this method, the AI is going to know the exact best, most efficient path to get through that maze, to navigate it, where a natural AI would probably get lost and would end up having to explore to find its way, to way through it. But a NavMesh is always going to give us the most efficient best path. Now, if you want to see some working examples of a NavMesh AI movement setup, I can recommend two different projects to you. The first one is the Lyra example game. So this is a fully implemented game, AAA game, set up so that you can explore and see how everything is created. In this, we do rely on the AI, so you can see the AI set up there. Secondly, we have something called the Matrix City demo. Now, this is a massive open world city, which has hundreds and hundreds of different AIs wandering around it with logic built in. Now, this also uses our mass crowd system to sort of to do avoidance. So this is a good example of that setup. For this project, when we get into it, we do not require you to download a project for this. We are going to be using the top-down template, which can be found under the games section. And we'll be using that to do all of our examples. So I recommend that you follow along with this. So I recommend that you open up that top-down template, create a new project for that. And we'll be able to follow along with everything that we're doing. Thank you very much. In the next videos, we will jump into the browser.",
