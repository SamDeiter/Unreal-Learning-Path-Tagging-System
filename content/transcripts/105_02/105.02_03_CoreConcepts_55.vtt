00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.799
For those who watch the Quick Start class on Sequencer, this will seem a little familiar,

2
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.439
but for those who have not, let's take a little time to explore some Sequencer fundamentals.

3
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.599
So what is Sequencer? Simply put, it's Unreal Engine's non-linear editor and animation tool

4
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.500
designed to supply users with the production tools they'll need to produce animation, trigger

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.560
various events like luprinse code, and smoothly transition between gameplay and linear animated

6
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:31.039
content. Sequencer is commonly deployed to build shots, generate pre-visualization,

7
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.519
manage animation in Unreal, and construct film sequences in game cinematics. From a workflow

8
00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.719
perspective, Sequencer leverages actors from the level and gives them a set of instructions. But

9
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.679
as the director, you must cast which actors are going to be used. Actors can be added to

10
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.640
Sequencer throughout the Outliner or Content Browser to create level sequence assemblies.

11
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.439
These level sequence assemblies are essentially a populated level sequence. So what's a level

12
00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:05.120
sequence? Essentially, it's a virtual data container. It stores various actors and their

13
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.359
associated attributes, keyframe data, lights, cameras, and other edit information. Level

14
00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:17.040
sequences can also contain other level sequences to create nested hierarchies capable of replicating

15
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.560
film sequences, shots, and departmental organization. They are represented in the level as a traditional

16
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.080
clapboard icon, and in Sequencer itself, level sequences are represented as traditional film

17
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.920
strips similar to what you'd see in a non-linear application like Adobe Premiere. Sequencer

18
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.960
is also capable of exporting edit decision lists and XML data to synchronize Sequencer

19
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.280
and your third-party non-linear editor together. As you begin your journey into creating content

20
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.840
for Unreal, one of the first concepts you'll need to learn is the idea of actor persistence

21
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.200
within your environment, or in Unreal what we call the level or sub-level. Essentially,

22
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.359
Unreal has three different ways actors can be controlled in Sequencer. This control determines

23
00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.719
when actors are available to the animator for animating and how long they'll persist

24
00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.479
in the level over time. Today, we're going to primarily examine two forms of persistence,

25
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.159
possessibles, and spawnable actors. Possessible actors persist in the level indefinitely and

26
00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.679
can be controlled or shared by multiple level sequences. If you know you have specific actors

27
00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.039
or characters that will be used regularly, keeping them as possessibles makes sense for

28
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:33.120
ease of access and repetitious use. It should be noted, however, that possessible characters

29
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.560
can only be controlled by one level sequence at a time. Spawnable actors only exist within

30
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.599
an active level sequence. They're identified within Sequencer and the Outliner by a lightning

31
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.400
bolt icon. This type of persistence is excellent for temporary actors who are needed for specific

32
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.240
needs within the shot. Perhaps some extra lights, or a background actor who shows up just for the

33
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.759
shot and then is no longer required. The idea of spawnables are appealing because it can keep

34
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.520
your level clean and its environment free of unnecessary actors when they're no longer required.

35
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.960
The last type of persistence is replaceable actors. This blueprint-driven form of persistence is

36
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.320
dictated by the binding lifetime track and allows you to swap out actors within Sequencer as needed.

37
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.879
Let's switch over to the engine and take a look at how these concepts work.

38
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.800
Alright, we'll begin inside our SEQ-105-02 map. Once it's loaded, you'll see that we have a lot

39
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.200
of actors inside this level. There's a road, a road sign, a really nice landscape and some trees,

40
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.320
and then there's a motorcycle. Anything placed into the level has the potential of becoming a

41
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.600
possessible actor by default when it's brought into Sequencer. Whatever it is, Sequencer can

42
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.439
possess that actor and give it instructions beyond the actor's original attributes in the level.

43
00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.320
Once the level sequence is done with it, the possessible actor returns to its default state

44
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.719
as it originally was within the level. So let's take a look at this in a demonstration. So we'll

45
00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:12.000
go and create a level sequence. We'll call this LSTest. Now this is a parent level sequence,

46
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.199
or what Epic likes to call it, a level sequence with shots. You can double-click on the icon and

47
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.839
go into the Sequencer UI and we're going to add a shot track. Now the shot track is unique in that

48
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:29.039
it allows you to nest level sequences inside of a level sequence. So to do that, just click on

49
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:36.959
the plus button and we'll say create new shot asset. This is shot 0010 underscore 01 or just shot 10

50
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:43.199
for short. Now this will create this filmstrip icon inside of your level sequence. This is basically

51
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.639
an empty level sequence and we're just going to trim it down a little bit, maybe make it 65 or so

52
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.159
odd frames long, move it over just a touch, and then we'll create a second level sequence and we'll

53
00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:03.680
call this one shot 20. We'll do the same thing. We'll trim a little time off of it here and at the end.

54
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:12.000
Now these two empty level sequences can be entered by double-clicking on the filmstrip icon. So if I

55
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.519
want to go into shot 10, it's just double-click. And you can see that we're inside of shot 10,

56
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.799
nothing's in here. It's empty. But if you look at the breadcrumbs over here on the right, you have

57
00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:30.719
LS test and shot 10. Now at this point, you're going to want to start to add actors into your scene

58
00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.079
and I'll go ahead and select the Unreal bike and say add actor to sequence.

59
00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:43.279
So now that the Unreal bike is in here, it's been possessed by shot 10. And I'm going to go

60
00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:51.039
and just lay it down on its side, raise up the front just a little bit. And I don't even need to

61
00:05:51.039 --> 00:06:00.399
set a keyframe on this. But when I go back to the LS test master, as long as my time marker is

62
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.519
inside this level sequence, the bike will be on the ground. But as soon as the time marker goes

63
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:10.959
outside of the level sequence, the bike returns back to its original state. Now,

64
00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:19.120
I'll go into shot 20. And I will add the bike again to this shot.

65
00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:26.560
I'm going to do something a little different with this one. I'll go ahead and bring it to the center

66
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.759
of the road, bring it closer to camera. And I'll rotate it around

67
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.800
and stand it upright. And I'll set a keyframe

68
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:43.279
and another keyframe. And I'll push it down the road.

69
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:54.480
I'll also go and change these keyframes to linear. Now if I press play and play this level sequence,

70
00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:05.759
you'll see that the bike animates down the road. Now, when we go back into our master,

71
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.480
you can see that the bike is being possessed by the individual level sequences that are active. So

72
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.680
here, at the beginning of the sequence, the bike is in its natural default state.

73
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.160
As soon as it hits shot 10, it lays down on its side. Here it goes back to its default state.

74
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.639
And then in shot 20, it travels down the road. Now, these level sequences can be moved any

75
00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:39.199
point in time. So if I want to make shot 21st, I can do that. And if I press play now,

76
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.120
we'll have the shot going down the road and then laying down on its side.

77
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:54.560
Now, something else to remember is that these level sequences, if they're stacked on top of each

78
00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.360
other, the shot that's on top takes precedence. So in this case, shot 20 has the bike traveling down

79
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.639
the road. And then as soon as it hits shot 10, it goes and lays down on its side. And then when

80
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:14.639
the shot 10 is over, again, back to its default state. Now, when it comes time for spawnables,

81
00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:20.000
it's a little bit different. Spawnables, if I go inside of this level sequence,

82
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.719
all we have is the Unreal bike. But I want to go ahead and add in another character or

83
00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:34.000
another actor that I eventually want to turn into a spawnable. Well, if we go into the content

84
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.080
browser, and we go to say, our assets, characters, actually, we'll go into mannequin here.

85
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:53.360
Characters mesh, and we'll put mannequin into the level. Now, this has been added to the persistent

86
00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:02.560
level. And if we look inside of sequencer, and we press play, he will just be there throughout

87
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.640
all shots. He's in the level just like the road sign is, the road, the trees, and so forth.

88
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.559
But if I go into shot 10, and I select mani, and I say add actor to sequencer,

89
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.519
now mani has been possessed by shot 10. I'm going to delete the control rig. And I'm going to move

90
00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:34.639
mani into place. So I'll just rotate him around 90 degrees. I'll move him over next to his bike.

91
00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:41.519
Now, in order to change this into a spawnable, you need to right click over mannequin and go to

92
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:47.919
convert selected bindings to spawnable actor. Now you'll see that mannequin has a little

93
00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:55.199
lightning bolt icon next to him. And I can proceed by giving him some animation. So I'll click on

94
00:09:55.199 --> 00:10:00.319
the plus button here and I'll look for a walk cycle and stretch it out.

95
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.200
And then I'll set some keyframes on mannequin as well.

96
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.600
And you know, he's walking down the road because maybe he's run out of gasoline for his motorcycle.

97
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.240
And we'll convert this to linear. So if I press play here,

98
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:32.320
mani will be walking down the road. Now let's go back again to the level sequence with shots.

99
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:38.159
You can see that mani is now disappeared out of the level. It's because he's been converted to

100
00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:45.600
spawnable. So as the time marker moves, shot 10, mannequin manifests for shot 10.

101
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.600
And he has been spawned and he'll continue to be there as long as shot 10 is active.

102
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.040
But as soon as the time marker leaves shot 10, mannequin disappears, everything goes back to its

103
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.519
default state. And in shot 20, the motorcycle drives down the road. Now this is an advantage of

104
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:10.639
spawnables in that you can see it keeps our level clear of unnecessary actors. You know,

105
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.480
if you have a bunch of possessibles inside of the scene, they may clutter up, you know,

106
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.120
what you can see or what you're viewing inside of your level sequence. And you might have to

107
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.879
turn them on or off, shut off their visibility or move them out of the way of the camera. And that

108
00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:35.679
can be a little bit annoying at times. So using spawnables is a direct way of just basically

109
00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:40.240
turning them off for only what you need. And you can use spawnables for anything. You can use it for

110
00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:47.120
actors like Manny, or you can use them to generate spawnable lights, additional cameras, and so forth.

111
00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:52.799
All right, this completes this individual demo. And we're going to move on to our next module

112
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:57.120
in which we're talking about some core structures within Sight of Sequencer.
