00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
Creating a level sequence is a straightforward process and there are three methods you can

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.160
deploy.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.419
By using the main toolbar and the Cinematics Clapboard button, you'll create a new level

4
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.199
sequence, place that level sequence icon into your level, and it will open the level sequence

5
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.120
in Sequencer for you automatically.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.000
The next option is using the plus add button in the Content Browser.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.359
Browse up to the Cinematics option and choose Level Sequence.

8
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.519
This will create a new level sequence, only place it in the Content Browser where you

9
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.719
specify and not immediately save the level sequence to your hard drive.

10
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.359
The final method is simply right clicking in the Content Browser and creating a level

11
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.239
sequence in the folder you're currently viewing in the Content Browser.

12
00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.359
Like the previous method, Unreal will create the level sequence but not immediately save

13
00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.519
the file.

14
00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.000
Whether or not to add a level sequence to your actual level is a matter of choice.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.820
If you do, they'll appear in the level as a clapboard to give an indication to other

16
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.840
teammates working on your project that this level sequence is tied to a particular level.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.439
Selecting it and seeing the details in the Details window will allow you to open the

18
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.359
level sequence and do other additional tasks.

19
00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.840
Once a level sequence has been created, you can populate Sequencer with Skeletal or Static

20
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.359
Mesh Actors, Lights, or Cameras, and provide animation sequences to your actors and key

21
00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.760
frames on control rigs and transform tracks.

22
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.200
Fade tracks are also available to fade in and fade out of your sequence from any color

23
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.840
you choose.

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.680
Right clicking over the fade track will bring up the Properties field to set various attributes

25
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.700
or you could use the Select Details menu.

26
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.680
With all of this information, you're armed and ready to start creating something amazing.

27
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.600
Let's move on to our next module where we'll conduct a practical exercise.
