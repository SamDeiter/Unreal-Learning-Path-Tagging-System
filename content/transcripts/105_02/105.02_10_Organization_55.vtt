00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As we wrap up this course, I'd like to point out that animation production with a game engine is a challenging but rewarding process.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It allows for instantaneous feedback at a level of visual quality that most DCCs can't match.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Plus, Sequencer's feature set is designed to address many production requirements.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
However, if you need more help, there are many things you can do to make your experience in engine a more productive one.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The first thing you can do is to concentrate on project and level organization.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Unreal, as a game engine, is designed to achieve real-time results within the limits of existing GPU hardware.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Unlike traditional production that usually has more computational resources,

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you should go into your projects prepared and with a plan to optimize your environments and animation performances

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for greater efficiency based off of your GPU's capabilities.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
By learning how to use a game engine, you'll ultimately become a better production artist.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Most linear content projects rely on large environments and multiple scene setups for shot-based workflows.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
One of the ways that Epic addresses this issue is by using levels and sub-levels,

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
whereas game productions will most likely use world partition for open-world gameplay.

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The level editor is critical for organizing your environment by creating specific sub-levels.

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The primary level or map that pairs with your master level sequence will contain what is known as the persistent level.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
By default, everything resides here, including anything that is newly added to the level,

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but once artists start creating additional sub-levels, they're more free to assign different purposes for them.

18
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
By double-clicking on any one of these additional sub-levels, newly added actors can be placed within them.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Depending upon your particular project, levels and sub-levels can be used for environmental organization,

20
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
sequence lighting setups, effects, special camera moves, or whatever you need.

21
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Then within Sequencer, these levels can be turned on or off by using visibility tracks.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The result allows the artist to selectively visualize the portions of the environment on a scene-to-scene basis.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Another technique to keep yourself and your project running smoothly is to create a logically organized nested folder structure

24
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in your content browser and your project outliner as much as possible.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
While some studios do have their own organizational techniques, many do not.

26
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Lack of a common folder structure can make it difficult to hand off projects to other members of your team.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A considerable amount of time is wasted by artists trying to dissect other people's work.

28
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Make it easier on them and adopt this technique especially if you're working within a group.

29
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Of all the organizational tools in Sequencer, sub-scene tracks unquestionably remain one of the most powerful tools you can use.

30
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This particular type of track is designed to take nested level sequences and use them as a potential layering source inside your parent level sequence.

31
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Depending upon your needs, sub-scene tracks can be used to separate out specific creative tasks like animation, effects, camera, lighting, and sound.

32
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
By individualizing your creative requirements into separate tracks, you permit artists to work more collaboratively with one another.

33
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Since each sub-scene track is a separate level sequence, departments or individual artists can check out the sub-scene via source control

34
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
while still allowing other artists to work within the parent level sequence.

35
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Sub-scene tracks can be edited, retimed, shuffled, or turned on and off if needed.

36
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
When combined with a level editor, projects can be highly organized and yet remain quite flexible for large or small teams working together.

37
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Project organization remains one of the most important aspects of any production.

38
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In order to improve your chances of success, Epic has collected a number of relevant production tips and resources that can help you along the way.

39
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We'll take a look at that in our next section.
