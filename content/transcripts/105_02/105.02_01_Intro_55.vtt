00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
Hello everyone, and welcome to today's class on Sequencer, Introduction for Linear Content.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.240
My name is Brian Poole, and I'll be your authorized Unreal instructor throughout this

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.919
course.

4
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.800
This class is a follow-up from the Quickstart Sequencer class on shock construction.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.199
We will readdress some of the content from that class, but we'll also go beyond those

6
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.440
lessons by examining more advanced workflows.

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.040
Here's a quick look at what we'll be covering today.

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.920
In overview, we'll begin by asking the question of what is virtual production, and what are

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.200
the benefits of using Unreal Engine for linear content.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.280
Then we'll re-examine some of the core concepts of sequencer's capabilities like what is

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.880
sequencer, what is a level sequence, and we'll discuss actor persistence types.

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.000
That will be followed by an examination of core structures in sequencer, define a few

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.679
terms, and compare Unreal Sequencer to the structure of film production.

14
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.159
Next we'll take a look at sequencer's interface, discuss event management, curve editing, and

15
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.120
setting up level sequence templates.

16
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.159
Plus, we'll spend some time learning about Unreal cameras and their components, take

17
00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.599
recorder, live link face, and VCAM.

18
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:21.480
In hands-on, shock creation and assembly, we'll focus on how to actually set up a nested

19
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.000
level sequence assembly, how it's different from using just a single camera cuts track

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.880
alone, and how it ties to the shot track, sub-scene tracks, and other advanced functionality.

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
This will be followed by a practical exercise.

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
And then finally, in final recommendations, we'll talk about level organization, folder

23
00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.760
structures, and sequencer best practices, and then look into potential tips and resources.

24
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.320
Alright, let's get started.

25
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:59.679
These class will be utilizing the SEQ-10502 map level in the SEQ-90505 project file.

26
00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.199
It can be downloaded under content, courses, course maps.

27
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:09.479
The project file you've downloaded contains items associated with four different courses.

28
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.879
We will be examining the course SEQ-10502.

29
00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.639
Our goal for this course is to expand our knowledge of sequencer by understanding the

30
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.319
basics of creating multiple shots using nested level sequences.

31
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.759
This project will utilize a level, multiple level sequences, and contain a character,

32
00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:32.039
multiple cameras, camera cuts tracks, and a shot track.

33
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:37.079
This approach is the more advanced of two sequencer assembly methods, whereas the first

34
00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.439
method only leverages a single level sequence and a single camera cuts track, this version

35
00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:49.039
showcases nested level sequences for more advanced shot creation and flexibility.

36
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.719
After you've downloaded the zip file and extracted its contents, you should see the

37
00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.840
SEQ-90501-55 project file.

38
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.159
This file was created in Unreal 5.5, so if you have an early version of the engine, you

39
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.159
should upgrade.

40
00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.400
If you have a later version of Unreal, you'll have to convert the project file to Unreal

41
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.240
5.6 or higher by following the prompts Unreal provides for you upon launching this project.

42
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.640
The primary map should automatically load, but in case it doesn't, let's take a look

43
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.080
as to where you can find it.

44
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.840
Inside the content folder, there is a course folder.

45
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.640
This folder contains a course maps folder.

46
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.360
Within here, you'll find maps for all four courses within this project.

47
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.320
In case your level didn't open upon launch, let's double click on the SEQ-10502 map.

48
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.520
This will bring up Rural Australia.

49
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.360
This is a really great map with some very realistic models and textures.

50
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.920
What's even better is that it's highly optimized and can run on most computers and GPUs with

51
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.080
ease.

52
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.920
This map can be found on FAP in case you're interested in having it in your own library.

53
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.560
If you're curious as to where the assets are for this level, they're located in the

54
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.879
assets folder inside Rural Australia.

55
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.080
And if we take a look over here in the Outliner, everything is nicely organized into folders

56
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.120
and named beautifully with a dedicated naming convention.

57
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.560
The level sequence we'll be examining and ultimately recreating is located in the course

58
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.720
folder inside of the SEQ-10502 folder.

59
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.480
Then open course topics, shot creation folder, and finally the multi-shot EX folder.

60
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.000
Our level sequence is SEQ-multi-shot EX.

61
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.639
If you'd like to take a look, double click on the level sequence icon.

62
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.919
This will open the Sequencer UI and you'll be allowed to view the sequence by clicking

63
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.360
on the camera icon in the shots track and then pressing play.

64
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.319
This will show you the three level sequence shots being played back-to-back in sequence.

65
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.680
In our next module, we'll take a look at a brief overview of using Sequencer for virtual

66
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.319
production and for the creation of linear content.

67
00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.159
Then we'll move on to core concepts and structure behind Sequencer and understand how Sequencer

68
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.360
fundamentals operate.
