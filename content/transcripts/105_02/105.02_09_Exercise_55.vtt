00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
When using Sequencer to create linear content, you must fully understand what the Camera

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.679
Cuts track is being utilized for, along with comprehending the idea of using nested level

3
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.240
sequences.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.960
In a nutshell, the Camera Cuts track is responsible for binding specific cameras to the level

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.600
sequence so Unreal knows which camera to render.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.280
Level sequences that are used as shots are brought into the parent level sequence via

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.940
the Shot track, and each shot must have its own dedicated camera and camera cuts track.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.179
As you build your parent or master level sequence, Sequencer takes on its non-linear

9
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.060
editor role to allow you to move your shots into any order you see fit.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.980
In our demo, we'll be recreating an even simpler three shot sequence that leverages these concepts.

11
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.520
Please understand that there are multiple ways to go about this process.

12
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.939
The style in which you build your shots will ultimately be what works best for you.

13
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:59.620
Anytime you start a new project, its success or failure largely depends upon how organized

14
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:00.619
you are.

15
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.640
Sequencer is no different.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.939
To start, let's make sure you have the 105.02 map properly loaded.

17
00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.539
The level will be located in the Course Maps folder within the Courses folder.

18
00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.719
Find the 105.02 level file and double click on it to load it.

19
00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.099
This is your level.

20
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.620
Next you'll need to make your own working directory.

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.780
To do this, navigate to the Courses folder and then open the SEQ 105.02 folder.

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.579
In there you'll find the Course Topics folder.

23
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.459
Open that and proceed on to the Shot Creation folder and finally create your own folder.

24
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.099
Since there is an existing Multi Shot EX folder, call your folder something else in order

25
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.659
to store your files in it.

26
00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.060
Double click on the folder and it will immediately open.

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.579
Now you're going to need a level sequence.

28
00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.239
Inside your Multi Shot EX folder, right click and go to the Cinematics pop up contextual

29
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.859
menu to create a level sequence.

30
00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.819
Call this SEQ underscore cine underscore EX.

31
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.840
This is ultimately going to be your parent or master level sequence.

32
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.280
Create three folders and name them cinexshot1, cinexshot2, and cinexshot3.

33
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.340
These folders will hold the necessary level sequences for your shots.

34
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.539
It's best to break out shots into separate folders for the sake of keeping things organized.

35
00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.579
Next enter the folder for your first shot.

36
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.640
Create a level sequence and name it ms underscore ex underscore shot1.

37
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.240
This is your first shot.

38
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500
Don't create extra shots yet though.

39
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.920
We'll save that for another step.

40
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.200
Once you've created your shot, double click on the icon and open Sequencer.

41
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.760
Once your shot is open, you'll need to create a new cine camera.

42
00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:58.379
Use the create camera button in the sequencer toolbar to add a spawnable camera.

43
00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.319
This will also generate a camera cuts track.

44
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.299
Rename the camera cinecam underscore 01 underscore shot1.

45
00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.859
You can pilot the camera by pressing the camera pilot button.

46
00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:17.139
It will turn blue when it's active.

47
00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.979
Next you'll need to add an actor to sequencer.

48
00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:25.119
Since the original 105.02 map doesn't include an SK mannequin in the level, we must find

49
00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.399
one and place one there.

50
00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.839
Go to the content browser and navigate to the assets folder.

51
00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.120
Open it and then continue to the mannequin folder.

52
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.679
Inside you'll find the character and mesh folders.

53
00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.039
You'll want the SK mannequin mesh in the mesh folder.

54
00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.439
Click and drag this into your level.

55
00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.120
Return to sequencer and with mani selected click the plus add button.

56
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.860
Go to add actor to sequencer and then choose add SK mannequin.

57
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.700
Once in sequencer, right click over mani in sequencer's outliner and convert the selected

58
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.539
binding to spawnable.

59
00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.980
Now it's time to add some animation to our actor.

60
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.300
Since we'll be using animation sequences rather than directly keyframing mani's control rig

61
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.840
itself, we must remove or mute the control rig to allow the animation sequence to function.

62
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.680
Select the control rig and delete it.

63
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.560
Don't worry, you can always get it back later.

64
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.480
Now to get your animation on your actor, click the plus button for mani in the animation

65
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.519
track.

66
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:34.639
This will bring up a menu for you to choose an animation sequence.

67
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.459
Search for mani underscore anim underscore track and add it to sequencer.

68
00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:45.800
Once loaded, make sure the sequence starts at frame zero.

69
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.180
Next we must adjust our actor's position, animate the camera and modify our shot's duration.

70
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.019
Whenever you add an animation sequence to an actor, please be aware that the animation

71
00:04:55.019 --> 00:05:00.259
data might move your character to a different location.

72
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.800
If you noticed, by adding the mani anim track to mani, he's moved way past the scene where

73
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.120
we're filming.

74
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.360
This is because the animation sequence's animation was offset from zero zero zero when

75
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.120
it was exported.

76
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.360
To correct for this, all we have to do is zero out mani's transformations and he should

77
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.759
pop into place.

78
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:31.500
If you want him precisely in front of the sign, move him plus 50 units on the y axis.

79
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.860
Next we'll need to reposition the camera.

80
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.159
Click on the camera pilot button so you can see what the camera is seeing or if you prefer,

81
00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.579
you can switch over to a two pane window layout and drag the camera into position.

82
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:47.420
If you're feeling adventurous, you can animate the camera by setting a few keyframes to push

83
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.920
in or boom up.

84
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.480
Finally, we must trim down the first shot to approximately 105 frames.

85
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.360
Move your time marker into position and press the right bracket key.

86
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.120
This will create an out point for your level sequence while the in point will remain at

87
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.160
zero.

88
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.920
Please realize that some studios will choose to start their sequences and shots at frame

89
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.840
one thousand one rather than at zero.

90
00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.060
It's easier to leverage warm up frames and back time the shot if necessary.

91
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.219
But for now, zero is fine.

92
00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:26.259
Finally, make sure that the camera cuts track runs the length of the entire shot.

93
00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:33.899
If necessary, adjust its in and out points accordingly.

94
00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:38.859
Our next step is to create our second shot, but we're going to do something a little different.

95
00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:42.539
Instead of creating everything again from scratch, we're going to duplicate shot one

96
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.640
and use it as the basis for our next shot.

97
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.360
Once duplicated, rename it properly to shot two and move it to the appropriate shot folder.

98
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.760
Now that we have our second shot created, we'll need to modify our camera's position

99
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.960
and alter the animation track accordingly.

100
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.720
Delete any existing keyframes you might have created from shot one and move the camera

101
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:20.820
into a new position.

102
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.380
Secondly we're going to have to adjust and reposition the animation track for shot two's

103
00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:43.600
performance by sliding the action we want towards frame zero.

104
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
Once you've retimed the animation track, be sure to adjust the camera cuts track and

105
00:07:47.600 --> 00:08:03.100
the sequences out point accordingly.

106
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.220
For shot three, repeat steps six through eight, or if you'd like, you can just right-click

107
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.340
over the shot in Sequencer to duplicate and save your shot to the appropriate folder.

108
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.420
If you wish to explore different camera placements for shot three, you can either duplicate the

109
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.439
shot as an alternate take and manually replace it in your edit, or utilize Sequencer's take

110
00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:28.960
system once you're in the level sequence with shots.

111
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.120
Now it's time to put everything together.

112
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:43.519
Go to your level sequence with shots and add a shot track.

113
00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:46.620
This will allow you to bring your shots into Sequencer.

114
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.659
Place them in the appropriate order and adjust your level sequence with shots out point as

115
00:08:50.659 --> 00:09:06.819
necessary.

116
00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:10.259
Don't forget to add your duplicated third shot to the sequence, especially if you've

117
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:16.200
made some changes.

118
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:34.419
Click on the shot track's camera icon to review the sequence when you press play.

119
00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:41.139
If you need to trim your shots to improve continuity, feel free to do so.

120
00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:45.659
Once your shots are in the shot track, you can utilize Sequencer's take system to right-click

121
00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:50.259
over the shot and create a new take.

122
00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:55.539
This will also duplicate the shot and make it accessible in the take systems menu.

123
00:09:55.539 --> 00:10:01.299
Once you make the shift, you can alter the take however you wish.

124
00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:06.859
If you don't like it, you can always switch back to take one.

125
00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:09.059
What I've just presented to you is just the beginning.

126
00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:12.620
There are so many different ways shots can be constructed and modified.

127
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.620
You could leverage a subscene track for Manny's animation, or you can alter camera settings,

128
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.379
add some depth of field, or read time shots using various time remapping tools.

129
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.059
The options are up to you.

130
00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:30.099
If you're curious about subscene tracks, the original SEQ Multi-Shot EX level sequence

131
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.060
includes the usage of a subscene track for your review.

132
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.899
Take a look and see how it might change your shot setup.

133
00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:40.180
Now let's move on to some final recommendations.
