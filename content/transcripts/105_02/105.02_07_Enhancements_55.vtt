00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
Epic has provided a series of enhanced tools for Unreal Engine that directly integrates

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.519
with Sequencer to allow more advanced users the opportunity to expand their creative workflows.

3
00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.399
These tools are designed to bridge the missing gaps many productions face when working in

4
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.240
virtual production.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.719
Intended to promote digital connectivity, enhance performance capture, and improve cinematography

6
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:28.719
capabilities, these enhancements are a must for your workflow.

7
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.359
First up is Take Recorder.

8
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.399
This tool is like having your own recording studio in your back pocket.

9
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.079
Designed to record gameplay animation, live performances, camera data, and other sources

10
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.640
of input, Take Recorder allows artists to leverage their recordings directly in Sequencer.

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.519
By layering captured recordings together via sub-scene tracks in Sequencer, sophisticated

12
00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:57.159
performances can be accomplished with a minimal crew in a highly iterative workflow.

13
00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.199
Live Link Face and MetaHuman Animator are next.

14
00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.000
Built around the Live Link data transfer protocol, users with an iPhone and a reasonably powered

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.439
computer can stream facial capture data directly into Unreal Engine.

16
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.719
When paired with MetaHuman Animator and MetaHuman Creator in Unreal Engine 5.6 or above, these

17
00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.120
tools can generate live performances for a number of applications like digital avatars,

18
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
high-end facial capture, or streaming.

19
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.840
iOS devices with true depth cameras can find the Live Link Face application on the Apple

20
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.680
Store while other vertically head-mounted professional camera systems are also supported

21
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
with Live Link Face.

22
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000
Finally, for all of you aspiring cinematographers out there, Epic's Unreal Vcam app allows you

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.240
to connect your iOS device to Unreal in order to leverage the device's AR kit capabilities.

24
00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.399
By transmitting the iOS device's internal accelerometer data back to Unreal via Live

25
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.439
Link, Unreal will in turn update a virtual camera inside the Engine scene and pixel-stream

26
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.560
the live feed of the CG environment back to the user.

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.000
The result is a real-time virtual camera that allows the user to frame up shots by hand.

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.759
When paired with other practical camera equipment like gybs or a steadicam, professional shots

29
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:18.399
can be constructed that would be difficult to accomplish by keyframing alone.

30
00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.159
The Unreal Vcam is compatible with iOS version 16 or higher.

31
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.359
And if you happen to have the Nintendo Joy-Con controllers, you can use this for camera control

32
00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.199
as well.

33
00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.479
And for those Android users out there, you're no longer left in the dark.

34
00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:39.159
Epic has released Vcam for Android in Unreal Engine 5.4, and as long as you're running

35
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.960
Android device 7 or later, you'll be able to enjoy the same capabilities as your iOS

36
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.520
coworkers.

37
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.240
You can also leverage multiple Vcam users to control multiple Vcam devices in a single

38
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240
session.

39
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.960
Okay, let's move on to our next topic.
