00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As we wrap up this course, I'd like to point out that animation production with a game engine is a challenging but rewarding process.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It allows for instantaneous feedback at a level of visual quality that most DCCs can't match.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Plus, Sequencer's Feature Set is designed to address many production requirements.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
However, if you need more help, there are many things you can do to make your experience in Engine a more productive one.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The first thing you can do is to concentrate on project and level organization.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Unreal, as a game engine, is designed to achieve real-time results within the limits of existing GPU hardware.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Unlike traditional production that usually has more computational resources,

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you should go into your projects prepared and with a plan to optimize your environments and animation performances

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for greater efficiency based off of your GPU's capabilities.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
By learning how to use a game engine, you'll ultimately become a better production artist.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Most linear content projects rely on large environments and multiple scene setups for shot-based workflows.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
One of the ways that Epic addresses this issue is by using levels and sub-levels,

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
whereas game productions will most likely use world partition for open-world gameplay.

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The level editor is critical for organizing your environment by creating specific sub-levels.

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The primary level or map that pairs with your master level sequence will contain what is known as the persistent level.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
By default, everything resides here, including anything that is newly added to the level,

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but once artists start creating additional sub-levels, they're more free to assign different purposes for them.

18
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
By double-clicking on any one of these additional sub-levels, newly added actors can be placed within them.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Depending upon your particular project, levels and sub-levels can be used for environmental organization,

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
sequence lighting setups, effects, special camera moves, or whatever you need.

21
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Then within Sequencer, these levels can be turned on or off by using visibility tracks.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The result allows the artist to selectively visualize the portions of the environment on a scene-to-scene basis.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Another technique to keep yourself and your project running smoothly

24
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is to create a logically organized nested folder structure in your content browser and your project outliner as much as possible.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
While some studios do have their own organizational techniques, many do not.

26
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Lack of a common folder structure can make it difficult to hand off projects to other members of your team.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A considerable amount of time is wasted by artists trying to dissect other people's work.

28
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Make it easier on them and adopt this technique especially if you're working within a group.

29
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Of all the organizational tools in Sequencer, sub-scene tracks unquestionably remain one of the most powerful tools you can use.

30
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This particular type of track is designed to take nested level sequences

31
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and use them as a potential layering source inside your parent level sequence.

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Depending upon your needs, sub-scene tracks can be used to separate out specific creative tasks like animation,

33
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
effects, camera, lighting, and sound.

34
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
By individualizing your creative requirements into separate tracks,

35
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you permit artists to work more collaboratively with one another.

36
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Since each sub-scene track is a separate level sequence,

37
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
departments or individual artists can check out the sub-scene via source control

38
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
while still allowing other artists to work within the parent level sequence.

39
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Sub-scene tracks can be edited, retimed, shuffled, or turned on and off if needed.

40
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
When combined with a level editor, projects can be highly organized

41
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and yet remain quite flexible for large or small teams working together.

42
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Project organization remains one of the most important aspects of any production.

43
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In order to improve your chances of success, Epic has collected a number of relevant production tips and resources that can help you along the way.

44
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We'll take a look at that in our next section.

45
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
As of the date of this recording, Epic has assembled a number of tips and resources

46
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that can provide you with the extra technical information and workflow suggestions

47
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
designed to improve your knowledge of the engine.

48
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
When you factor in third-party websites, authorized Unreal instructor platforms, and Unreal partners,

49
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the number becomes far too many to list in this presentation.

50
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
However, here are a few simple sequencer tips and resources that you can use to get you underway.

51
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Every artist has their own preference when working in Unreal.

52
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Therefore, Epic has ensured that you're able to configure your workspace however you wish.

53
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
By customizing your user interface, you can set up a layout that works best for your hardware's capabilities.

54
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Single, dual, and widescreen monitor configurations can be used to best accommodate single and multiple disciplines

55
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
based on your individual preferences and skill sets.

56
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Within Sequencer, these UI shortcuts will make navigating around Sequencer considerably easier.

57
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Right mouse button and drag will pan the timeline horizontally and vertically.

58
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Middle mouse button scroll will move the timeline up and down while shift and scroll will also pan the timeline left and right.

59
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Control and scroll is used for zooming the timeline.

60
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Alt-Shift, right mouse button drag can be used for free-form zooming around the time marker,

61
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and pressing the Home key on your keyboard will reset the range slider bounds.

62
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Control plus drag on the time bar to the right will define a specific zoom region,

63
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
whereas control drag on the time bar to the left will reset the zoom region.

64
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
In addition to Sequencer-based shortcuts, Unreal has some universal shortcuts that will help you with your general ease of use.

65
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
There are also a number of white papers available for your educational benefit,

66
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
including a white paper detailing the breakdown of Epic's Fortnite cinematic trailer.

67
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
While the paper is somewhat dated by referencing Unreal Engine 4,

68
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the white paper highlights processes and workflows as much as tool sets,

69
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which can be very beneficial for the beginner.

70
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
If you have a specific technical question, the Unreal developers website is a great place to start

71
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in order to find a number of resources, including in-engine documentation and video-related content.

72
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Epic also provides a number of links within the slide deck for you to explore.

73
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Take some time and take a look.

74
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Alright, this concludes Sequencer.

75
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Introduction for linear content.

76
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I hope you enjoyed the class, and we'll see you the next time. Thank you.
