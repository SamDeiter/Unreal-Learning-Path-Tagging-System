00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
Virtual production is commonly thought of as an umbrella term that encompasses a wide

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.919
range of technologies and digital production techniques.

3
00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:16.600
It's also directly associated with a set of technologies known as in-camera visual effects.

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.879
Here practical content is married directly to digital content on a physical stage using

5
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.800
an LED volume.

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.280
This form of virtual production allows directors to view and interact with virtual environments

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.440
and characters in real time.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.400
Through the use of Unreal Engine, virtual production allows for some interesting tool sets, including

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.480
smart animation construction tools such as Sequencer, iPad-based virtual cameras or VCAMs,

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.079
a data recording tool set known as Take Recorder, LiveLank, data transmission protocols, remote

11
00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.079
API, performance capture, and ARKit face tracking.

12
00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.519
There are also workflows enabling real-time editing and scouting, which allows multiple

13
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.640
users to manipulate the scene in real-time.

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.480
Combined with VR scouting-based tools, directors have the opportunity to examine the virtual

15
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640
world in headset.

16
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.799
Finally, Unreal provides an all-in-one solution by recording, editing, and integrating post-production

17
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.759
inside of Unreal Engine, thus reducing the need for external 2D and 3D applications.
