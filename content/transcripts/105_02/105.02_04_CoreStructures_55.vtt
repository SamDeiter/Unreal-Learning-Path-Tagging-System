00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
Using a game engine for linear animation can be intimidating for the uninitiated.

2
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.820
It requires learning new terminology that the average DCC software user is unlikely

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.679
to be familiar with.

4
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.039
Being very modular in nature, Unreal breaks down its world construction and animation

5
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.140
features with an array of new technological engine terms that unfortunately have no equivalent

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.280
in classical digital film production.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.600
These terms are directly related to the process of building a game, but once you learn them,

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.399
you'll come to appreciate their logic and capabilities.

9
00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.560
Static meshes and scale meshes describe different types of actors based on whether or not they

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.920
have joint-based deformable geometry.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.640
Unreal also uses different terms for objects in the scene, like actors, pawns, and characters.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.280
The environment is described in terms of the world, maps, levels, and sub-levels.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.799
Level sequences are where you control and keyframe your actors in Sequencer, and control rigs

14
00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.579
are like animation rigs.

15
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.340
Games are used for triggering specific actions or for different visual looks.

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.859
Blueprints are a visual scripting system, and source control is a way to check in data

17
00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.219
in and out of your project using a server depot.

18
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.859
However, Sequencer's feature set attempts to mirror some of the terminology you're more

19
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:26.900
familiar with in film production like scene assemblies, takes, layouts, shots, and sequences.

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.500
Unreal's project structure and logic has been designed to essentially replicate the

21
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.040
operations of film production.

22
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.880
The project is the film, and each layer of complexity in Unreal replicates the specific

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.360
set of responsibilities in the film and its crew.

24
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.260
Large sophisticated structures within Unreal are broken down into smaller and smaller components,

25
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:54.380
which grant the user the ability to replicate the intricate requirements of production.

26
00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.140
Sequencer is also capable of replicating different shooting styles.

27
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.819
Classical cinematography recognizes the master scene technique, which can be directly replicated

28
00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.340
in Unreal using a single level sequence, multiple cameras, and a camera cuts track.

29
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.539
Whereas the triple take technique is matched by what you're learning today, using nested

30
00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.659
level sequences and layered sub-scene tracks to create the illusion of continuity by the

31
00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.060
editing of multiple level sequence shots and having your actors hit specific marks.

32
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.659
Each methodology works to organize the necessary roles in production ranging from lighting

33
00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:33.300
to set construction to performance.

34
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.060
So it's not a coincidence that sequencer's level sequence and assembly structure bears

35
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.420
a direct similarity to the organization of film production.

36
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.659
A typical film is broken down into acts, sequences, scenes, shots, and takes.

37
00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.560
Each unit is smaller than the last, and they're effectively nested inside of one another.

38
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.599
On the Unreal side, sequencer is designed to replicate film structure by using level

39
00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.319
sequences.

40
00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.680
These actors can create levels of organization through nesting level sequences into one another.

41
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.400
This will allow organizational control over scenes, actors, cameras, lights, keyframes,

42
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.520
and other technical capabilities.

43
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.199
Since level sequences are essentially virtual containers, they're capable of handling

44
00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:19.840
greater and greater orders of animation complexity as more level sequences are added to them.

45
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.479
For new users, it can be confusing to realize that a level sequence actor can accommodate

46
00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:29.159
so many different tasks while still just being called a level sequence.

47
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.599
You may hear me say a level sequence shot or a level sequence sequence, but they're

48
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.140
all level sequence actors being used in different ways.

49
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.640
So try not to be confused by the word level sequence.

50
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.800
Here's an example of what a nested level sequence looks like.

51
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.920
I've loaded the SEQ multi-shot EX level sequence that we'll be recreating during the hands-on

52
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.559
exercise.

53
00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.359
It consists of a level sequence with shots with multiple level sequence shots inside

54
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.359
of it.

55
00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.399
The level sequence with shots can possess an array of shots through the use of a shot

56
00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.119
track.

57
00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:14.000
Level sequence shots can be moved, trimmed, or have their play rate altered.

58
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.759
You can even generate alternate takes using the take system, or fade up from black using

59
00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.000
the fade track.

60
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.719
The structure of a nested level sequence can be nearly anything, especially for game

61
00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.719
construction purposes.

62
00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:31.920
But for cinematics and linear content creation, there are usually some core ingredients.

63
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.560
Inside each level sequence shot, you'll have level actors like props or characters to animate.

64
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.920
A minimum of one camera per nested level sequence shot is needed whether it's possessible or

65
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.639
spawnable, and most importantly a camera cuts track is required to generate footage.

66
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.680
Another option is to use what is known as a sub-scene track.

67
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.919
This is another form of nested level sequence that functions like a layer.

68
00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.199
If you're familiar with After Effects, it's very similar to a pre-composition or pre-comp.

69
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.719
Sub-scene tracks can be used for animation, camera moves, effects, or specific lighting

70
00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.800
setups.

71
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.039
When played in sequence, the level sequence with shots pulls the camera binding data from

72
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.439
each shot's camera cuts track, so it knows which camera it's looking through and what

73
00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.960
needs to be rendered.

74
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.439
The result is a continuous sequence when played back through the timeline.

75
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.640
This completes this brief examination of a nested level sequence.

76
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.759
Let's move on to our next module, where we'll take a look at some sequencer features and

77
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.800
tools.
