00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Welcome to Sequencer Features.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.719
The Sequencer UI is straightforward and seems very familiar.

3
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.359
Its design is reminiscent of Adobe After Effects and Premiere, but instead of editing

4
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:18.000
rendered movie footage, Sequencer edits footage containing animated 3D assets.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.920
The toolbar houses all of the primary settings, menus, render options, and breadcrumb indicators

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.280
to help the user navigate between level sequences.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.400
The Outliner on the left adds actors and organizes tracks.

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.799
You can drag actors into this area from the Outliner or use the green plus add button.

9
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:40.160
The timeline manages the playhead, defines track content, and gives a visual display

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.520
of what's happening from audio waveforms to setting keyframe indicators.

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.400
The selection details pane displays properties and binding information, and the playback

12
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.399
area allows sequence, transport controls, and time range sliders for defining your work area.

13
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.439
Working in combination with Sequencer's Outliner, the event manager and its triggers can be added

14
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.599
to a sequence and tied to specific blueprint endpoints.

15
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:13.599
This function allows precisely to control when specific events occur within a level sequence.

16
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.680
These triggers could initiate particle systems or tell Unreal when to jump out of Sequencer

17
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.239
and into gameplay.

18
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:25.119
The Sequencer Curve Editor is a helpful feature for traditional 3D animators.

19
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.919
Specific tracks can be identified, isolated, hidden, or shown within the controls on the left.

20
00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:35.959
Keyframes can be moved, scaled, tweened, and tangents can be weighted or broken as needed

21
00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:42.319
by the artist to control animated motion.

22
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.039
The Sequencer Template is a feature that is intended for ease of use and quick shot creation.

23
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
If you know how many shots you'll need and approximately the average length of each shot,

24
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
this template can construct a level sequence with shots with as many nested level sequence

25
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.219
shots as you require.

26
00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.520
This makes the organization of shots easy, and it can create identical shot parameters

27
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.800
for each nested level sequence.

28
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.360
In this demonstration, we'll take a look at how event management is handled in Sequencer

29
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.280
with a simple example.

30
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.840
By adding an event track into Sequencer, the user can create dedicated triggers that execute

31
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.719
specific functions in what is known as the Director Blueprint.

32
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.400
The Director Blueprint is a special type of blueprint that's tied to your specific level

33
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.719
sequence.

34
00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.280
When bound to an actor like a particle system, Sequencer can execute the trigger at a specific

35
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.560
point in time to activate the particle system.

36
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.439
So I have a particle system here.

37
00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.199
It's an explosion that I got from the starter content.

38
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.480
If I click on the Admitter and go over to the Details panel, I'll search for Auto Activate

39
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.840
and I want to turn this off.

40
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.479
I don't want the explosion just going off by itself.

41
00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:52.000
Next I'll need to take the explosion and the Admitter and add it into Sequencer.

42
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.159
Actor to Sequencer, Add P Explosion.

43
00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.840
Now I'll click on the plus track button and I want to add an event trigger.

44
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.719
This event track will allow me to set keyframes anywhere I want, so I'll just create one here.

45
00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.719
Now this keyframe doesn't do anything yet, and the reason for that is it's not bound

46
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.319
to the specific Director Blueprint yet.

47
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.680
To do that, you can do it in one of two ways.

48
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.280
You can either right click over the keyframe itself, go to Properties and click on Unbound,

49
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.240
or you can double click on the keyframe itself.

50
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.319
This will open up the Director Blueprint and you can see our specific P Explosion event.

51
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.319
I'm going to create a toggle active node and make sure that everything is tied together.

52
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.079
I'll compile and I'll go back to our example.

53
00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.519
Now we still don't have an explosion yet.

54
00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.639
There's one more thing that we have to do.

55
00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.759
Right click over the keyframe, go to Properties and say Call in Editor.

56
00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:03.120
Once you do that, anytime that you drag the time marker over the keyframe, the explosion will happen.

57
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.120
There you go.

58
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.359
Anytime that you drag this over there, you'll get another explosion.

59
00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.719
You can set as many of these keyframes throughout the event track as you wish.

60
00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.199
Next up is the Curve Editor, which is launched within the Sequencers UI and is capable of

61
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.800
refining animation curves, keyframe placements, and tangent settings to achieve the desired

62
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.959
results.

63
00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:31.159
With its unique set of keyframe scaling tools, animators have very precise control over anything

64
00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.599
animated within Sequencer.

65
00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.800
So I have Manny here and he has a control rig and I've placed some animation on his arm

66
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.839
to do a little wave.

67
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.240
If I want to look at those curves, it's just simply select the IK handle and go into the

68
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.719
Curve Editor.

69
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.640
Now we can see all of the individual keys and the individual curves.

70
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.600
You can view these curves with different viewing modes.

71
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.880
You can use the Transform tool to select curves and scale them from different pivot points.

72
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.280
So right now this is all scaling from the center.

73
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.200
If I put the pivot point down into the corner, I can scale this by that.

74
00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.800
There is also the Retime Lattice tool, which is a way to basically retime curves based

75
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.360
off of a two-dimensional lattice.

76
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.839
So by double clicking here, I can add lattice points inside the Curve Editor in order to

77
00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.399
scale and modify keyframes.

78
00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:35.879
There's also the Multi-Select tool, which is another mechanism to scale individual curves

79
00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.599
or multiple sets of curves, which is also pretty nice.

80
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.520
You can scale horizontally, vertically, etc.

81
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.640
Finally, there's a number of different tangent tools across here.

82
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.160
Selecting these, you can go and put them onto AutoCubic or you can break tangents.

83
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.640
You can weight tangents, make them constant or linear.

84
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640
There's a number of different functions here within the Curve Editor that are pretty effective.

85
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.360
All right, let's move on to our last feature.

86
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.500
The last feature I want to demonstrate in this module is the Sequencer Template.

87
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.319
Select the function in the Create Level Sequence button and it will allow you to set the number

88
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:22.280
of shots, their duration, and other specifics like directory placement and numbering settings.

89
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.240
Once it's executed, you can find the parent level sequence and the shots you specified

90
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.480
in the folder of your choice.

91
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.560
So here's the Create Level Sequence button and we'll go up here to Add Level Sequences

92
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560
with Shots.

93
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.439
I can give it a specific name.

94
00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.800
I'll call it Test and it'll be saved in the root path of Game Cinematic Sequences.

95
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.720
I'm going to ask for five shots and each shot will be five seconds in length.

96
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:52.000
So when I say Create Level Sequence with Shots, it will create the level sequence and you

97
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.519
can see that I have one, two, three, four, five shots and that's located here in Cinematics

98
00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.279
Sequences Test.

99
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.439
Alright, this concludes our brief overview of some of Sequencer's features.

100
00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.599
Let's move on to our next module that covers some powerful tools.
