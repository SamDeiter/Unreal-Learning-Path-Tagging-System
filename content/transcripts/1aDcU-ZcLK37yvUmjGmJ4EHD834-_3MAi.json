  "text": " Now before we go further I want to talk about our player controller because we're going to actually be creating a brand new player controller for this interaction logic to go into and the reason for this is because we want the player no matter if it's a player or a car or a spaceship or a ball to be able to press the E key on their keyboard and be able to interact with this light switch and this is a really key. Importance of building things inside of one real we always want to make sure that we build stuff in the correct location now we could build all of this functionality that we're building in each one of these classes we could build it inside of our player inside of our car inside of our spaceship or inside of our ball but that means that there are now four locations where we need to maintain our code since the player controller acts as a way to take different ponds over while we're building. While still giving the user the same type of input based off the device they're using we can input code or implement code inside of our player controller and have that accessible to the user no matter the type of pond that they are so let's go ahead and pop over here to the editor really quick and I'm hit control space and we're going to right click inside of here we're going to go to our blueprint class and then from our pick parent class we're going to look for our player controller. I'm going to call this BP underscore interaction interaction controller let's go ahead and double click on it to open it up now to understand what we're going to do next let's take a look at the following image so what we're going to be doing is we are going to be creating a line in space and that line is going to start in the center of our character and it's going to go out at X distance that we define and it's going to be anything that is inside of that line. We can determine different properties about it and for us what we're going to be doing is we're going to be casting this line X unit out into space and we're going to see if that line comes in contact with an object that contains our interface and if it does then we'll be able to do something with it so again this is an example here a visual example of what we're going to be creating we're going to be creating a line that goes out into 3D space that starts at our players center and has an endpoint and we're going to use this to determine if we are looking at a light switch or not so here's a breakdown of the nodes that we're going to be using so we're going to use our input action interact is our trigger. Then what we're going to do is we're going to use a combination of our get actor location are get controlled pawn and our get actor forward vector to determine the location and the rotation that the player is currently facing in the world and we're going to use that. Inside of our line trace by channel node we're going to use this to give us a start and an ending value and once we've done that we can do it then do things off of our out hit which will describe here in just a little bit so let's go ahead and come over to the editor now and we're to come over to our event graph and let's go ahead and start adding stuff so for things first we're going to look for our IA underscore and look at that we have our IA interact. So that's the first thing that we want right there. All right so then we're going to look for our get actor and we probably going to have to disable our context sensitivity there we go we want to transform a get actor location. Then we're going to look for our get controlled and we want this pawn get controlled pawn. So there we go and I'm actually just going to delete these because we don't need them right now and then we're going to get actor forward and we want this transformation get actor forward vector. Then what we're going to do is I'm going to pull this over just a little bit because I don't need that big of a details panel. I look for our line trace by channel there we go there's our line trace by channel and then what we're going to do is we are going to need a couple of applications and one of the things that we can do here is we can just add this multiply and we can actually right click on these and change their inputs so we're going to do this in just a second here. I'm going to hit control C and control V because I want to pop back over to our slide deck here to show you kind of what we're going to be setting up. So here's what we're going to do when the user does the interact when that's triggered what we're going to do is we're going to get our controlled pawn we're going to get its location and its forward vector and then basically we're going to take the location that it's at is our start. So at the beginning of our line trace and then what we're going to do is we're going to take the forward vector we're going to multiply that by a float value say 2000 and then we're going to multiply that by the actor location and this is going to act as the end of our line trace. So this value right here which is set to 2000 is basically the distance at which we want this interaction to happen because we don't want it to go infinitely across the world because that means that somebody could turn the lights which on you know from all the way across the room. No we want them to be relatively close to it so let's go ahead and set this up now and we're going to pop over here to the editor. So the other cool thing about this is this is the basic logic for any time you want to do a line trace inside of unreal. So if you ever want to do a line trace ever again following this will get you set up and a way that will be successful pretty much every single time. So let's grab our control pawn and again this has to go into our get act or get actor location and get actor forward vector. So oops plug that in right there so again we want our get actor location that's going to be the start of this and then what we're going to do is I'm going to pull one of these over here. Actually we need both of those so we're going to bring both of them here so what we're going to do is we are going to take the return value here and plug that in like so. But instead of that being multiplied in each channel we want this by a float so we're just going to click on this and we're going to go to float single precision. There we go and we're going to do two one two three so by 2000 and then what we're going to do is we're going to take our get actor location. We're going to multiply it by this offset value and then we're going to plug that in to our end right there. Now the next thing that we can do here is if we come here to this debug draw type and we can go for duration to compile and save what that's going to do right there is it is going to allow us to see the line that is traced in the world. So let's go ahead and look at what we're going to do last so the last thing that we're going to do here is on our out hit which is we can have this special note called break hit result but this will do is this will allow us to do very specific things when very specific conditions are met so. So for us when we hit an actor we are going to. Do a test does it does object implement interface and we're going to see does this object that we have hit with our line trace implement our BPI usable interface and if it does then we are going to send a message use objects so let's go ahead and set that up now. So what we're going to do is we're going to come out of here and we're going to look for our break hit break hit results and we can actually get more information by pushing this triangle here and we're going to see all of the different things that we have inside of here so we're going to take our out hit and plug that in right here. And then what we're going to do is we're going to pull off of our hit actor and we're going to look for does implement and we're going to say does object implement interface and the interface that we want to check for is BPI underscore usable. When are to check to see if we've hit our usable known the other cool things we can do is if we push this little button again we will collapse that back up so that we get this nice little. Smaller no just with the thing that we have there and just going to right click and straighten that all right so the next thing that we need to do is we need to come out of our line trace by channel and we need to actually do something so what we're going to do is we're going to left click and drag off of this and we're going to look for our branch node. To remember branch is unreal if else I'm also going to double click on this just to add a reroute and kind of just move this line up a little bit and you don't have to do that just kind of makes things a little bit easier to read so. So. When we do interact with an object we're going to test and we want to do something if this is true and what do we want to do well we want to use object and we want this. Use object right here. Oops nope that was the wrong one sorry let's put on context sensitivity again and we'll go use object. Let's do that one more time there we go use. And there we go we want that one right there. All right and last but not least we do need to come out of this hit actor here and this is going to be the. The target so the actor that we've actually hit and I'm also going to double click on this to bring this over here like so and just like this. Kaboom there we go all right so I did show you this last little part right here our. For duration what this is going to do is this is going to allow us to see our line trace like we see in the image right here. Now if we were to come over here to our editor and try this out let's just press play really quick nothing is going to happen so you can see it does say hello. The reason for this is because if we come over here to our our game mode we need to. Put our player controller class that we have here in that game mode so let's go ahead and pop back to our editor here and we're going to come here to our world settings if you don't see the world settings you can come up to your window and then go down to not world partition but world settings that will populate this window. And then under our game mode here we're going to come to our player controller class and we're going to look for my BPI interaction controller. Now once I press play what should happen is we should get this red line coming out and the little square that you're seeing right there that signifies where this object actually first made a hit and then the green line that you're seeing is what it is penetrated to so the red is the first line the green is the second line so what it hit has gone through if it has penetrated. All right so now that we have that set up and working what we're going to do next is we are going to set up our light blueprint.",
