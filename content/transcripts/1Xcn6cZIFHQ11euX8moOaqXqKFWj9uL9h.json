  "text": " Now that we've got a workable character we should probably deal with animation. We're all familiar with the concept of a skeleton in a games engine. It's a series of bones in a hierarchical framework with joints and restraints applied. However, in Unreal, the skeleton asset is also responsible for associating animation data, not just providing the skeletal hierarchy within the skeletal mesh. A skeleton asset can be shared between other skeletal meshes, and these skeletal meshes don't necessarily have to match exactly. Sharing of a skeleton asset provides a way to share animation between characters or even entire animation blueprints. The skeleton asset is responsible for the following. Animation retargeting, and this allows animations to be reused between characters that use the same skeleton asset but may have different proportions. It's responsible for creating and storing sockets, and sockets allow developers to place a point within the skeleton that is offset from a bone, and this is specifically useful for attachment of weapons to a character, for example. Next, it can store animation notifies, and these are going to be discussed in depth in just a second. They can store animation curves, and these curves can be used to drive material parameters, for instance. Lastly, they can store animation slot names, and these are useful as these can be used to play animation montages for characters. A skeletal mesh is built up from two parts. Firstly, we have the set of polygons which make up the surface of the mesh, and secondly we have the hierarchical skeleton that will be animated to deform those polygons. A skeletal mesh stores a reference to the skeleton asset that it was created from. Skeletal meshes also hold levels of detailed data that can be used when considering performance costs of skeletal meshes in your game. When it comes to gameplay, this is the mesh type that we can use for our player characters or indeed anything that need to animate based off of a skeleton. A character will hold a skeletal mesh component which will in turn hold reference to a skeletal mesh itself. Skeletal meshes can only play animation sequences which are tied to its skeleton asset. This is important to note when considering playing animation sequences on the character. Animation sequences are the building block for creating an animation blueprint. An animation sequence is a single animation asset that can be played on a skeletal mesh. They contain all the key frames from our animation authoring package of choice that specify transform information, that being your location, rotation and scale at a specific point in time and are linked to a specific skeleton. We can't just stick an animation sequence on top of any old skeleton, they need to be compatible. We can think of an animation sequence as your looping walk animation asset or your idly kicking the ground asset. Whilst animation sequences can be played through code, it's much more typical for them to be used as building blocks when authoring animation instances which we'll touch on in just a second. They also allow developers to apply anim notifies which again we will touch on in just a second. Animation sequences also support animation curve data which provide a way to change the value of a material parameter or a morph target while the animation in question is playing back. Lastly, animation sequences can generate root motion. However, in regards to root motion, you need to consider whether you need this to be replicated in a networked game. If this is the case, then animation montages is what you'll need to use instead. And that leads us nicely onto montages. What if we were to have multiple animation sequences that we wanted to play together? This is where the anim montage comes in. Anim montages provide a way to control an animation asset directly through blueprint or C++. More importantly, animation montage can be used to combine several different animation sequences into a single animation asset. Furthermore, animation montages can be broken into sections which can be played either individually or in combination. These sections can also be made to loop continuously until told otherwise. Events can be fired within a montage that can perform tasks such as playing a sound cue or changing the ammunition count as well as replicating tasks in a networked game. Complex animation sequences can be assigned to slots within an animation montage, the playback of which can be controlled through blueprint or C++. Each section created has a name and a location in the slot, and we can use this name to either jump directly to a section of the montage or cue it up to be played after the current section has been completed. To put the above information into context, if we were to take a reload animation, we can break the reload montage into the following. Firstly, a start animation sequence, a reload loop animation sequence right in the middle, and a finished reloading animation. We can combine these animation sequences and assign them to play within sections of the montage. Our gameplay code can trigger the start reload section, cause us to stay within the looping section as we fill the magazine back up, and then gracefully transition into the finished animation section when the clip is full. So we mentioned anime notifies earlier, so let's take a look at those. An anime notify is an event fired from the timeline of an animation sequence, letting us drive some kind of gameplay based directly off of an animation. Let's take a walk cycle as an example. We can see in this example that the notifies can be of a particular type. A great example here would be the use of the play sound notify to play the sound of a footfall as each foot makes contact with the ground. We could then expand off of this quite easily and add additional notifies to draw decals under each foot to draw a footprint. As can be seen in this example here, the Unreal Engine offers out of the box animation notifies that can be used to achieve many things. We can also create our own animation notifies both within native and blueprint. We can create anime notifies by simply basing our new anime notify class from the anime notify state class. Anime notifies give developers some key functions that we can override to achieve our goals and these are receive notify tick, receive notify end, receive notify begin and get notify name. It isn't necessary to implement every function, your use case might just be that you need to perform something when an anime notify begins or you may have a use case for doing something over a period of time in which case you'd most likely use the notify tick function. Above are just examples of the functions that we've just discussed and at a bare minimum you should implement the notify tick and both begin notify and begin end functions. It's also important to note that the incoming parameters of these functions offer up are the mesh component, this being the skeletal mesh component of the animation that we're triggering the notify on, the animation, this is the specific animation sequence or montage that is triggering this notify and the frame delta time and this will give you the time since the last animation update. The animation instance is a C++ implementation from which animation blueprints are based, they're more commonly referred to as just animation blueprints. Animation instances are visual scripts that are used to author complex animation systems so consider your players animations. As an example let's take an FPS character, we'd want to control not only how they animate when moving in 3D, that being their forwards locomotion but also how they walk backwards, strafe, crouch, sprint, jump and aim down sights. We'd also want to control how these animations blend into one another, this is the job of the animation instance. The animation instance consists of two separate systems that being the event graph and the anim graph. These separate systems work together to create the correct pose each frame. The event graph inside the animation instance is the same as any other graph inside Unreal, it's a visually scripted environment to drive gameplay through context specific set of nodes. In this case we have access to specialized animation nodes such as blueprint initialize animation and blueprint update animation. Initialize essentially being the begin play of our animation with the update being its tick with the delta time being passed in accordingly. The event graph is where we receive data that will inform the anim graph as to what pose to produce. For instance we may have set an is crouching bool to true, we'll want the event graph to receive that change and the anim graph to reflect that change in its subsequent animations. It's also important to note that in the examples above both of these blueprint events are fired prior to the animation graph having been updated. If you find that you need more of an update post the animation graph update then consider using the blueprint post evaluate function instead. The anim graph is where the actual pose is evaluated. We can see here that we've got two potential poses coming in on the left, one being that of running and the other being crouching. The anim graph is taking an alpha between the two and producing a single result with the blend node. After that blend node we have an aim offset applied because after all in an FPS game the player hasn't suddenly stopped aiming now that they're crouching. The anim graph takes a base pose and modifies parts of it to reflect any additional gameplay data. The anim graph comes with threading out of the box. There's obviously a lot of stuff going on here so think of all the transformations going on under the hood. Threading makes a lot of sense in regards to transform manipulation. We can enable the multi-threading for anim graphs by enabling the use multi-threaded animation update setting in the animation instances class defaults. Of course with any threading we need to take into account its safety and there's a few things that are broadly saved to thread. Those things would be the anim graph nodes themselves such as the ones we can see on this slide. We've also got directly accessing any member variables such as the is crouching member and then finally any blueprint pure functions as their const they're not going to modify the state and are thus safe to access on other threads. We also have the ability to enable fast path optimizations which are enabled in the project settings. This essentially enables the anim graph to access internal variables directly without having to copy them from the native into the blueprint virtual machine. Of course this does come with caveats if we're intending to modify that value we'll lose out on that optimization and as such it's useful to have the native animation instance class make any changes that you would want before having it bubble up into the animation graphs VM. State machines and animation layers can be used to organize and break up animation functionality. We can see here that we've got separate nodes for idle and for running with a transition link between the two. This lets us set up bespoke node layers for each state in isolation from one another. These links can have conditions applied to each other preventing certain states from blending into each other. So in the above example the run state can blend into the jump start state but jump start can never blend back into run.",
