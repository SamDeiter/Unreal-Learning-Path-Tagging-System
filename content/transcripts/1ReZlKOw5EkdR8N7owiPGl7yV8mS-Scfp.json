  "text": " Now, in this section, we will primarily work with an Unreal Engine for hands-on shot creation and assembly. But first, we will begin with a short walkthrough for shot creation in Sequencer. And we talked about this a little bit in previous sessions when we discussed the basics for creating level sequences. Here, I want to reiterate that level sequences can be created in two ways, from the Cinematics button in the main toolbar and from the Content Browser by right-clicking within the Content Browser to create level sequences. So let's jump into the Engine and review level sequence creation. Let's start first at the top bar and head up over to the Cinematics button. Click on this button and you get two options, Add Level Sequence and Add Level Sequence with Shots. We're going to choose the option to Add Level Sequence, and that will give us a pop-up menu that allows you to choose the folder location for your level sequence, as well as set the name for your level sequence in the Naming bar. Now you can also add a new folder to maintain organization if you right-click within the Save Assets area and choose New Folder to create that folder location. While this is one approach, I do feel that this way is a little too slow and can lead to some accidental disorganization if you're not careful choosing the correct folder where you want to store your assets and your folders. Instead, let's close this window and consider another option for creating level sequences and folders. And this was pointed out at the first slide within the bottom section of the Shot Creation slide. To begin, we're going to create a folder in the Content Browser to help stay organized. So we're just going to right-click within the Courses folder, right-click, and create a new folder. We're going to name this folder Course Underscore SEQ EX for example, and go ahead and double click in there. Then right-click here, go up to the Cinematics option, and choose Level Sequence. That's going to generate a new level sequence, and then all we need to do at this point is name the level sequence according to your Studio Naming conventions. For this example, we're simply going to call this SEQ CineCam EX for example. Now we can also call this our SEQ Shot example, or whatever you want to call this while you're working in production. And before we get too far into creating our level sequence examples, I do want to return to the slides and discuss some additional Shot Creation notes. So when creating level sequences, it's important to note that a level sequence does not need to be placed within a level in order to be called or triggered in the game development or linear content production. Level sequences will frequently include and or target content within specific levels, and it will be beneficial to maintain organization by implementing sublevels for assets being called into action by a level sequence. So that said, if you decide to add a level sequence actor to this level, it will help ensure that other members of your project are aware that a level sequence is intended to be used with that specific level or sublevel. It will be up to your project or production manner to determine if this practice should be implemented for the project or production. Additionally, there are some basic assembly considerations that should be noted before you begin working with level sequences. If you recall in a previous section of this course, we discussed terminology for working with Unreal Engine, specifically the actor class for assets within Unreal Engine. And as we work through our level sequence assembly, we will be working with the skeletal and static mesh actors, adding in pre-built animation tracks and potentially using keyframes for our camera animations. We will also be reviewing the use of fade tracks to achieve a more cinematic feeling level sequence. So that's it for this section. Next we will dive into the engine and continue our hands-on Shot Creation and assembly with a practical exercise using camera cuts.",
