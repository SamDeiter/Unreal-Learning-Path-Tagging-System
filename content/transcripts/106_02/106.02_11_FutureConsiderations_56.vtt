00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
In our final video, we'll wrap up the course and discuss future considerations.

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.640
There are many ways to expand on the Datasmith capabilities we've already discussed, including

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.199
a number of other options when importing Datasmith, using Data Prep recipes, including using templates

4
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.160
like the Collab Viewer, which has architecture and automotive variations, and include robust

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.039
Datasmith capabilities already.

6
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.320
Some of what's coming up for Datasmith include more round-trip capabilities where we can

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.519
actually bring our data from Unreal Engine back to our DCC tools, and more capabilities

8
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.960
directly in Unreal Engine to reduce the need to go back to our DCC tools.

9
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.280
One final feature I'll show you, to give you a taste of what other Datasmith features are

10
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.899
in store, is Datasmith Runtime.

11
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.640
As mentioned, this also exists in the Collab Viewer template, and it is a way to load Datasmith

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.480
actors while in play mode, allowing for Datasmith files or GLTF files to be simply loaded into

13
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.880
memory without having to store them in your project.

14
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.120
Here in our empty scene, ensure Datasmith Runtime is enabled, and then here, I'll simply create

15
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.680
a Datasmith Runtime actor, which is actually referred to here as a Datasmith destination.

16
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.800
I'll leave that in the middle of my scene, and then I'll open up the level blueprint,

17
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.520
get a reference to our Datasmith Runtime actor, pull off of it, and go ahead and load file

18
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.800
from explorer.

19
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.040
Make sure we're coming off of begin play, and we could set a default path if we wanted

20
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.620
it to find a particular path automatically, but I can just compile this as is.

21
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.540
Go ahead and hit play.

22
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.420
It'll prompt me to load a Datasmith file, and I can go ahead and grab my old file,

23
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.060
cumulus exp with cone, and as our exposure gets set up, we can see we've got that Datasmith

24
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.980
file loaded directly into our scene.

25
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:18.859
And when I press stop, I'll find that because it was just loaded into memory, it's not

26
00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.179
even here.

27
00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.419
Thank you so much for following along this course.

28
00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.579
My name again is Alex Coulomb, and I wish you well on your Unreal Engine journey.

29
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.019
Take care.
