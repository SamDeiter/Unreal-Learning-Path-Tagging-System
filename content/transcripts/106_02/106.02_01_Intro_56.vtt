Hello and welcome to this course on Datasmith ingestion for Unreal Engine version 5.6.

2
00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.380
My name is Alex Coulomb, I am an Unreal Engine authorized instructor, course author, and

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.339
also I run the XR Creative Studio Agile Lens immersive design.

4
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.500
In this course we're primarily going to be discussing Datasmith as it pertains to static

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.859
mesh ingestion, and in this video we're going to go over the basic course outline and the

6
00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.100
agenda we have for this series.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.060
First off we're going to discuss what Datasmith is, how to use it, typical workflows with

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.700
DCC tools when you export and then import.

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll look at various options we have when tessellating CAD surfaces.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.260
When it comes to triangle count we'll discuss different implementations of levels of detail,

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.379
nanite, and how to know which one to pick.

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.100
In there we'll move on to looking at hierarchies and pivot points as they're set up in your

13
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.740
DCC tool of choice and some considerations for how best to get it from there into Unreal

14
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.859
Engine via Datasmith.

15
00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:10.260
Once your data is in Unreal Engine we'll look at the modeling tools and the static mesh editor

16
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.340
in particular which will allow us to adjust certain things such as pivot points, UV mapping,

17
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.340
etc.

18
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.180
After that we'll look at collisions and how to make sure they're set up appropriately

19
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580
for our project, and then we'll begin to wrap up with combining objects and looking

20
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.980
at optimization considering such factors as draw calls when to merge actors and use proxy

21
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.540
LODs and other ways that we can start to optimize the project to improve framerate.

22
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.660
Lastly, we'll wrap up with a few future considerations and ways to take this course content further

23
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.660
such as a brief look at Datasmith runtime.

24
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.179
In the next video we'll take a look at our overview of Datasmith.
