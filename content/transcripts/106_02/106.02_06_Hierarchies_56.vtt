00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
In this video, we'll examine how various DCC applications handle scene hierarchies

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.460
and how best to preserve them in Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.160
As we've already seen, Datasmith creates a hierarchy of parent and child relationships

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.400
in Unreal Engine to mirror a similar setup that started in the DCC tool.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.719
Whenever possible, consider adopting various naming conventions and using tools in your

6
00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.479
DCC application to automate hierarchies and keep things organized.

7
00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:35.439
Consider using layers, groups, blocks, adjusting your pivot points, or using dummy or null

8
00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:40.239
objects which are quite similar to empty actors in Unreal Engine.

9
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.519
Let's start with 3ds Max.

10
00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.980
Consider using the layers tool which works exactly the same way in Unreal Engine as it

11
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.159
does in 3ds Max.

12
00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:54.620
All objects in each layer will be preserved when it comes over into Unreal.

13
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.500
If you'd like to preserve the parent-child-actor relationship in the Outliner, if you'd like

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.979
to preserve a parent-child-actor relationship in the Unreal Engine Outliner, use the group

15
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.099
tool in 3ds Max to provide an empty actor for the child meshes to be attached to.

16
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.340
Ensure the pivot points are in the correct place and liberally use the rename tool to

17
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
ensure you know what each object is.

18
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.980
Be careful exporting any objects in 3ds Max that have been scaled or mirrored.

19
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.700
If you have, use the reset XForm tool in the Utilities menu prior to exporting.

20
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.740
Also note instances are preserved from 3ds Max and will result in a single static mesh

21
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.659
over in Unreal Engine 5.

22
00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.500
Here in Sketchup Pro, we can already see an example of when it can be important to rename

23
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
your actors to ensure that you know what they are.

24
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.659
If we didn't know what these are over in Sketchup, we're certainly not going to know

25
00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.219
what they are when they translate over to Unreal Engine.

26
00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.420
The way the hierarchies work is a group is used as a top parent under the Data Smith

27
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.260
scene, then come the components, then come the various objects that are part of the component.

28
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.580
If an object is separate and not part of a component or a group, it will lie directly

29
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.900
under the Data Smith scene in the hierarchy.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.819
Be sure to name your objects, components, and groups according to a naming convention

31
00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.019
that works for you.

32
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.060
Otherwise, as we can see, things get very messy very quickly.

33
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.739
Like 3ds Max, components that have the same definition will become instanced in Unreal

34
00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.979
Engine 5 and only have a single static mesh definition per object.

35
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:38.219
And again, like 3ds Max, layers will be preserved, which is primarily helpful for selecting groups

36
00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.340
of actors at once and toggling on and off different categories of objects.

37
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.700
In Revit, the hierarchy works like this.

38
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.900
A level is used as a top parent under the Data Smith scene, then come the family types,

39
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.699
then come the components inside of that family.

40
00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.379
The layer list that Unreal Engine will give you after a Revit file will be based on family

41
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.819
types.

42
00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.939
Note that because of the nature of Revit, you'll be somewhat more limited in terms of how you

43
00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.580
can rename or rearrange different assets.

44
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.219
Note that families also count as instance geometry and will create one mesh in Unreal

45
00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.500
Engine that gets used by all family objects in the scene.

46
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.860
Note that a family will create a single static mesh in Unreal Engine, which then becomes instanced

47
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.860
throughout the scene, just like 3ds Max and SketchUp Pro.

48
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.380
For Rhino, our layers become the top parent in UE5, then the defined blocks, then the

49
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.780
various components of that block.

50
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.659
Note that Rhino groups do not affect the hierarchy in UE5, unlike 3ds Max.

51
00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.579
In Rhino, we recommend using blocks as much as possible, as they'll also help with establishing

52
00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.579
pivot points.

53
00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.379
Otherwise, the pivot point of every object will be set to 000, resulting in objects that

54
00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.019
are very far away from their origin.

55
00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.300
Again, be sure to rename layers and individual objects in Rhino so when they come to Unreal

56
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.060
Engine they still make sense.

57
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.980
And note there's a robust scripting community for Rhino, and there are scripts out there

58
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.540
that will rename objects based on layers, groups, or anything else you might like.

59
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.340
Here are two Python scripts as examples.

60
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.540
Note that instanced blocks in Rhino result in a single static mesh definition for the

61
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.660
components of that block, again carrying on this trend that one piece of geometry can

62
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.900
then be instanced many times when it makes its way back over to Unreal.

63
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:38.579
In the next video, we'll explore the modeling tools available to us in Unreal Engine.
