00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video, we'll import a Datasmith file into Unreal.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now let's perform a brief exercise where we import our own .uDatasmith file into Unreal Engine.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you open up today's project folder, you'll see two subfolders, one for the uProject file,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which will give you access to the Unreal Engine project,

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then the other one is an assets folder that gives you access to CAD files, Datasmith files, and DCC files.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So we open up the Datasmith file folder, we'll see that we have two .uDatasmith files in here,

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
as well as the assets that come with each of them.

8
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In there, we see our .uDS mesh files, our .uDatasmith file in something like Notepad.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You'll see it's fairly readable, we see which program made this Datasmith file, right in a 3D in this case,

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
what version of Unreal it was originally made in, 4.27, as well as the various assets,

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then how they are going to be located in the scene, including additional data such as their light map values.

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So now go ahead and back up into the uProject folder, and go ahead and open up today's project.

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
From here, we can take what we've learned, and go ahead to here, Datasmith file import,

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we can find assets, Datasmith files, and cumulusexp.uDatasmith.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When we open that up, it'll ask us where we want to put it, I'll put it in this temp folder,

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then it asks us what we want to bring in, geometry, materials, and textures, lights, cameras, animations, etc.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And then if we plan on baking lighting, we can have a min and max light map resolution.

18
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If I do not plan on baking lighting, and if I do not intend to bake lighting and use Lumen,

19
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I can uncheck generate light map UVs.

20
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
From here, I can go ahead and click import, and we'll see that not only is a scene created here,

21
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but it is also automatically imported.

22
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We can see also the hierarchy has been preserved from Rhino.

23
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And if I wanted to adjust the origin of the whole project, for example moving the 200 cm up,

24
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I could do that and everything follows along, and if I wanted to update the actors from the scene,

25
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
if I re-imported the file, I could do that.

26
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Similarly, I could right click here and say re-import with new file, and go ahead and choose the cone option,

27
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and we'll see an option here as well for respawn deleted actors if I had already made some adjustments here.

28
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'll leave everything as it is, press import, and we'll see the scene comes in, and it looks the same,

29
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
except now we have this cone on top, which is the difference between the first file and the second file.

30
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If my original file had changed, I could just click re-import, and that would also update the scene as it was.

31
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Also note the example map under content maps, modern house, we can save our scene here,

32
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which is also an imported Datasmith scene file, as we can see right here.

33
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Find it in our browser if we like.

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
However, because we no longer have the source of this file, we are unable to re-import it.

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
In the next video, we'll explore tessellation options when importing CAD data.
