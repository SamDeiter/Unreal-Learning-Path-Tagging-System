00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
In this video, we'll discuss collisions and how to set them up properly with Datasmith

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.280
imports.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.200
When we first import geometry into Unreal, including with Datasmith, we are often presented

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.480
with a checkbox that asks us if we would like to generate collisions.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.719
We also have the ability to add in custom collisions using simple primitives like boxes

6
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:28.080
or spheres or capsules, as well as the ability to create auto-convex collisions.

7
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.679
A complicated piece of geometry using its own geometry for collisions can get expensive,

8
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.960
so when possible, try to keep collisions simple.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.359
And note, as seen in this example, that a single object can have multiple collisions,

10
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.200
so I find it pretty useful to be able to use some combination of the simplified collision

11
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.239
options here to create a custom set of different primitive shapes to conform to the collision

12
00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.539
shape that I need for a particular project.

13
00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.859
As a quick example, let's go back into our project and set up a couple collisions.

14
00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.920
If we want to see the collision already existing in our map, we can go to View Modes and click

15
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.819
on Player Collision, not Visibility Collision, and if we see that it's black like this,

16
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.019
we know no collision has been set up yet.

17
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:21.259
So let's use the same piece of wall geometry we were already looking at, double click here,

18
00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.659
and we can see, if we click on Collision, that because we don't have an option for removing

19
00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.780
collision, we know that no collision is set up yet.

20
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.739
This is a pretty simple box, so we could go ahead and do a box simplified collision, which

21
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.739
will adapt and conform to the geometry in a nice clean, simple way.

22
00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.780
Go ahead and save that.

23
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.939
And now, if we go back to that View Mode, we'll see this one object shows up as a collider.

24
00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.539
Let's try doing a custom one for the ground.

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.580
So instead of automatically setting it up, we can go into the static mesh here, and we

26
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:12.140
could go ahead and add still a box, but we might start to adjust a few features of it,

27
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.180
and we can move it up and down by grabbing it and changing it like this.

28
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.340
We looked at a side view, something orthographic.

29
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.099
And of course, if we wanted to build this up from a number of pieces, especially imagining

30
00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.980
if the terrain was higher, we might actually do this in a couple parts.

31
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.819
So perhaps we might have one piece of geometry over here, and I could hold down Alt, just

32
00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.340
like in the regular editor, to duplicate another piece of geometry here.

33
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.819
I could even rotate it if I needed to, and start to build this up from a number of different

34
00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.019
services, all depending on what level of precision you need.

35
00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.740
Perhaps you're going to have a basement level, and you need the collision to be clear, so

36
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.340
you have easy access to the basement area without being blocked by that additional collision.

37
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.020
Or maybe you just have floors that you want to set up in a particular way.

38
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.300
You might also get into the world of physical materials and creating friction in certain

39
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300
ways.

40
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.860
There's a lot of ways this can become more advanced if you like, but I'll go ahead and

41
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.020
save that.

42
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.219
And then once again, just check on our player collision, and we can see everything showing

43
00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.300
up there in the shapes of the collision we've done.

44
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.659
Now if we want to set this up in a bulk way for everything in our scene, we can go ahead

45
00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:52.740
and find the folder where this lives, mHouse, find it here, then we can go over into Geometries,

46
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.740
and we can select All and right-click, and we'll go to Asset Actions and Edit Selection

47
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.099
in Property Matrix.

48
00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.539
From here, we have all of these objects selected.

49
00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:13.699
We can do Control-A to confirm, and then for Collision, we can tell the collision complexity

50
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.420
to use complex collision as simple.

51
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:30.539
From there, if we save, we'll now find that if we go to our collision view, everything

52
00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.500
now has colliders.

53
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.980
And then if we wanted to go and disable colliders in certain places like the door, we could

54
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.339
just open up those particular pieces of Geometry and scroll down, and there's actually two

55
00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:47.339
choices here.

56
00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:52.939
We could change our collision preset to No Collision, or just simply change this back

57
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.819
to Project Default.

58
00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:02.139
Save that, and then we can see we have a nice opening where we can move into the project,

59
00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.660
bump into furniture, and climb upstairs.

60
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.540
And though noting that we are adding additional complexity, especially on the CPU, to have

61
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.780
such complicated geometry here for collision when that might not be necessary, this could

62
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.860
probably be done as a cube or a few cubes, all dependent on the needs of your project.

63
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.180
In the next video, we'll look at how to optimize our project further.
