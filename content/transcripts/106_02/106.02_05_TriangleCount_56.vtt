00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
In this video, we'll dive deeper into Triangle Count.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.160
Looking more at Triangle Count, as we just saw, various DCC and CAD applications have

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.800
their own ways of processing geometry, some of which allow more control over the density

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.179
of your mesh, while others do not.

5
00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.080
You should always keep your Triangle Count in check, especially if you do not plan on

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.679
using Nanite.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.960
LODs, or levels of detail, can be generated in your DCC tool or automatically by Unreal

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.920
Engine simply by selecting an LOD group or by specifying a number of LODs.

9
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.560
The idea behind LODs is that you will see higher poly, more detailed versions of a model

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.840
as you are closer to it and it takes up more screen space and a simpler, less triangle dense

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.320
version of your model as you get farther away and its space on the screen becomes smaller.

12
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.160
The more LODs you have, the heavier your geometry will be, especially in terms of its RAM usage,

13
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.439
so take care with deciding how many that you actually need.

14
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.359
Note that while you're testing in Unreal Engine, you can temporarily disable certain LODs or

15
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.700
even set a minimum LOD to determine what's actually necessary for your scene.

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.700
Here we can see in LOD settings the opportunity to set the number of LODs that we have, as

17
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.400
well as the decimated percent of Triangles that we are going to see.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.020
So for example, if our mesh had 10,000 Triangles, then at this level we'd be seeing 8,500 Triangles.

19
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.500
Don't forget to always apply your changes after you've adjusted.

20
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.780
And note that we have a Mesh LOD coloration view mode that actually will show different

21
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.900
LODs as different colors.

22
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
When fine-tuning these parameters, consider the details that need to be viewed on distant

23
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.780
objects and what is not as necessary.

24
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.939
And also feel free to consider adjusting the advanced option of the screen size, which

25
00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.140
will affect when we make a switch from one LOD to another.

26
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.819
If you are using a platform that can support it, Nanite is the newest Unreal Engine 5 technology

27
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.299
able to handle millions of polygons without breaking a sweat.

28
00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.099
It does this by determining what's actually visible at a per pixel level and never drawing

29
00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.939
more Triangles than what's actually needed.

30
00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.299
Here we can see a comparison of the same scene with and without Nanite.

31
00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.539
Without Nanite, Unreal Engine has to process 5.8 million Triangles, whereas with Nanite,

32
00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.299
that becomes reduced to just 16.7 thousand.

33
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.100
As we've already seen, in Unreal Engine 5.6, most new geometry that gets imported has Nanite

34
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.180
enabled by default.

35
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.100
However, there are plenty of opportunities to toggle Nanite on and off.

36
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.500
You can do this sometimes in the import dialog or just by right clicking on an object and

37
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.300
choosing Nanite enabled or disabled here, or when you're opening, for example, the static

38
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.460
mesh window, you also have access to toggle Nanite on and off there.

39
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.939
Once again, it will not apply until you apply your changes.

40
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.860
Let's take a brief look at the Nanite scene in the project, which can be found under Maps

41
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.340
and Nanite.

42
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.659
Here we can see a building as well as a more natural rock formation.

43
00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:30.140
And if we type in stat RHI, which can also be found up here under viewport stats RHI,

44
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:38.219
we can see that we're currently drawing between 13 and 16 million triangles.

45
00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.419
Now let's try enabling Nanite.

46
00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.539
We'll do it one at a time.

47
00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:47.959
We can open up SM Cliffs by finding it in the browser here and just go to Nanite, hit

48
00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.179
the checkbox or hit enable.

49
00:03:51.179 --> 00:04:00.099
And this will take a moment to process.

50
00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.699
And while the rock looks the same, we now see a drop in the total number of triangles.

51
00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.459
Let's try the same thing with the building, which can be tricky because as we can see

52
00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.500
here, this building is made up of lots of individual parts.

53
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.659
So what we want to do is we want to find the top level of classic building, find it over

54
00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:25.899
here, and then that entire geometries folder is going to want to be set to be Nanite.

55
00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:32.979
So we can control A to select all of them, choose Nanite, and say enable Nanite on all

56
00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.739
44 meshes.

57
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:36.379
We don't have to save it right away.

58
00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.819
We can test to see if it's doing what we expected to in our scene as all the geometry

59
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:42.979
reloads.

60
00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.579
And we can see as this is happening, a significant reduction in our triangles drawn.

61
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.419
We're now down to only 7,000.

62
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.300
And yet, we can see all the detail is maintained.

63
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.200
We can see this in our viewport by going to Nanite visualization triangles.

64
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.340
And we can see the way that these triangles change as we get closer and further away for

65
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.300
a cleaner view, type stat RHI again to remove that window.

66
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:29.660
And we can see the way that Nanite, automagically, handles real time LOD without needing to manually

67
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.980
set anything else up.

68
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.259
In the next video, we'll examine how various DCC tools handle scene hierarchies and how

69
00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.379
best to preserve them in Unreal Engine.
