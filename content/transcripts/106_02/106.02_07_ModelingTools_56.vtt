00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
In this video, we'll explore the modeling tools available to us in Unreal Engine, which

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.160
can help to adjust geometry that needs further changes after a Datasmith import.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.899
Sometimes, your scene may need to be readjusted in your DCC application, then re-imported

4
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.719
into Unreal as a Datasmith file.

5
00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:24.839
Other times, you may find it makes more sense to make the adjustment directly in Unreal Engine.

6
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.240
The Modeling Tools plugin is a good friend for this.

7
00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.439
It allows us to repair or adjust meshes without going back to our DCC application and do

8
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:39.560
things such as selecting triangles individually, by material, by element, or by smoothing groups.

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.959
We can change pivot point placement, we can delete or flip faces, we can adjust UVs, and

10
00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:51.239
we can even add material elements or sub-materials to any set of selected triangles.

11
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.679
In order to use the Modeling Tools plugin, it simply has to be enabled as the Modeling

12
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.879
Tools Editor mode.

13
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.960
You'll also find other editor modes, such as for hair, static meshes, and even skeletal

14
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.200
meshes, but they will not be covered in this course.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.159
To enact minor mesh repairs, simply select and edit faces using the variety of face

16
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.040
selection parameters available to you.

17
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.599
From there, you'll see common model actions, such as extrude, inset, delete, and flip if

18
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.680
you want to change the normals.

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.879
If you plan on acting on the same groups of geometry several times, you can create polygroups

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.079
for easier reselection.

21
00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.759
Also note the ability to easily relocate pivot points based on simple selections of the overall

22
00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.519
position relative to the mesh.

23
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:43.039
To briefly demonstrate modeling mode, let's go ahead and open up that Modern House Datasmith

24
00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:49.039
map, select any object you like, go to the drop-down here and select Modeling, which

25
00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.319
can also be found with Shift 5, and then we're presented with a cornucopia of different tools,

26
00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.639
creating fresh geometry.

27
00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:02.279
Briefly, let's go ahead and click Select and Try Select, just to see that we're able

28
00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.799
to grab services here.

29
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.400
There's the ability to create a polygroup if we've got a selection we plan on reusing

30
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.400
quite a bit, and if we go down to Deform, we can see a quick example of Offset.

31
00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.599
In case we want an easy way to change that geometry, we have tools like Displace, which

32
00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.879
with a higher subdivision of triangles could start to add a lot more variation to the geometry

33
00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.879
here if we wanted to feel a little less orthographic.

34
00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.439
Finally, let's just take a look over in X-Form and Edit Pivot.

35
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.079
We'll notice that in this scene, all of the objects came in with their pivot point over

36
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.719
here, which is 0, 0, 0, in the original project the Datasmith file came from, but we might

37
00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:52.680
want to reuse some of this geometry or just have easier access to adjust it, and here

38
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
we could click on something like Center to bring the pivot point here.

39
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.319
If we wanted to stay on the ground, we could click Bottom, and if we don't like how far

40
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.319
underground that is, we could go and start to adjust that manually.

41
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.960
We could go and start to bring this up until this is at 0.

42
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.960
As this transform is specific to the pivot point, once I press Accept, I now have a pivot

43
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.480
point much more usable for this particular piece of geometry.

44
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.080
In the next video, we'll look at collisions.
