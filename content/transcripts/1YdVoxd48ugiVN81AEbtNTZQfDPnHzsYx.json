  "text": " We've seen earlier that a traditional approach to ingesting data via Datasmith takes you through an import process, desolating geometry, in the case of CAD data, adding LODs, replacing materials to name a few actions. Now we'll take a look at automating some of these repetitive tasks through Python scripting. Start a new level and delete the shade of ball and the text in your scene. Consider resetting the floor location and hiding the grid to avoid flickering as you did earlier. Next, open Windows Explorer and browse to where you extracted the zip archive you downloaded for this class. Go to Assets, Scripts. Here you will find a few sample Python scripts to experiment with. We will start with a file named ds-inport.py script. It's a text file so open it in Notepad or Notepad+. This simple script is about importing and reconstructing a Datasmith scene without going through the Datasmith button on the main toolbar of the engine. Near the top, it points to a file on disk. You probably need to change the path as it certainly points to the wrong one at this stage. In your Windows File Explorer, copy the path where your gokart.3dm file resides. Paste that path to replace the d-rhinofiles.gokart path listed in the script. Once you have done that, it is important to also replace the backslashes with double backslashes, as this is how Python understands paths. Save the script before moving on. The rest of the script is pretty straightforward, but note the section where you can change the desolation of all incoming cat parts. This is the same as changing these parameters in the Datasmith import dialog. Set the Core Tolerance to 0.05 and the Maximum Edge Length to 1, and save the script again. You can also define a subfolder where you store the incoming information in the Content Browser. Note the path listed as GameDSImport near the end of the script. The forward slash game entry refers to the top level of the Content Browser. Which in this case means that a new folder named DSImport will be created for you directly under Content. Underneath that, a subfolder named after the Datasmith file will also get created. Again, make sure you save your script before trying to run it. In Unreal, use the Find menu to find the content file. In Unreal, use the Find menu to locate and run the option listed as Execute Python Script. Locate the file you've just saved, DSImport, and run it. And there you have it. You have just imported the Datasmith file and made adjustments to it, literally with a click of a button. Let's push it a step further. By specifying tessellation values at import time, you may have ended up with some detailed triangulation that may be important when you're nearby, but a bit much when viewed from a distance. You can see the resulting geometry by temporarily enabling the Visualization option under Show, Advanced, Mesh Edges. This is probably too detailed. You can of course remedy this by adding LODs to the various parts. However, there are quite a few static meshes in the scene, 48 to be exact. So instead, we'll use another script to automate that action. Open the script named LODByPresetHD.py and take a look at it. At the very top, you can see that it's using the same path in the Content Browser that the first script generated. So basically one script is building on top of the other. Next, you can see that this script is calling upon the LOD group named HighDetail. If you prefer to use another, then you can replace HighDetail with SmallProp or Deco or any other LOD group you have available in Unreal. And that's all you need really. From there, you can simply save and execute the script in your project to have all assets processed with added LODs. This will take a few moments as the script goes into a loop of finding and applying LODs to all the static meshes that are found in the designated folder. To test it out, you can temporarily switch from Lit Mode to Level of Detail Coloration, Mesh Lot Coloration, and zoom in and out to see the effect. Finally, we'll take a look at replacing materials via Python scripting. There are currently five materials applied to the various parts of this vehicle. One way to replace a material manually is to right-click it in the Content Browser and then go to Asset Actions, and then select all assets using that material so you can edit them in bulk. And even then, you may not see the assigned material in the Details panel because one or more Null objects may also be selected. You need to deselect those in order to access the material to be replaced. And then of course, you'd need to do that for every other material that needs to be replaced. Again, this kind of repetitive behavior is easier done through scripting. Open the file named SimpleReplaceMaterials.py that has been provided to you. The way it works is easy. It takes a named material in one folder, and replaces it by another material in another folder. So Metal Red, that is part of the Datasmith ingestion, will be replaced by MiCaliperRed, that is part of the Automotive Materials library. The same holds true for every other material that was ingested and needs replacement. If you run the script, you can see how much faster it operates as opposed to having to do this type of work manually. Python scripting can be powerful, and although it's rather easy to understand its syntax, you still need to have some basic programming skills to make the best of it. Save your scene if you so wish, and the level as MyCard.py. Next, we'll take a look at Visual Data Prep that enables you to do this type of work and more, but in a very visual way, which is ideal for non-programmers.",
