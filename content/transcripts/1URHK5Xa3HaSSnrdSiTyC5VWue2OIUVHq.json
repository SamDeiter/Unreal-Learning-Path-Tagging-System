  "text": " Hello everyone, and welcome to this Unreal Engine class on FBX Ingestion. My name is Amer Yassine. I am an Unreal Engine instructor and I will be your host for this session. Today we will be discussing data ingestion using the FBX file format. FBX has been around for a long time. It works particularly well when dealing with assets one at a time. We will first discuss the benefits of FBX and look at some early considerations as you export FBX files from your 3D program of choice. We will further explore potential problem issues such as scale discrepancies and pivot points, and look at how to make adjustments from within the engine so that you don't necessarily have to jump back and forth between Unreal Engine and your DCC app. We will also look at the benefits of LODs as well as Nanite functionality to control the level of detail of your meshes. We will discuss collisions and collision generation and management. We will also look into skeletal meshes and how they differ from static meshes when you import them via FBX. And finally, we'll look at how you can retain hierarchies when importing FBX files. One final note, I will be using 3ds Max as an example of a digital content creation or DCC application to demonstrate interoperability. If you are not familiar with 3ds Max, that's fine as the concepts discussed here are also applicable to other 3D applications that you may be using. Enough talk, let's dive into it.",
