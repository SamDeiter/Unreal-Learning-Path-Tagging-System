  "text": " For this course, the project we will be working with is split into separate workshops. So while we won't be building a custom rig from start to finish, we will, however, be introducing you to some different tools with Unreal, while building practical tool sets. You should have the project already unzipped and ready to go. If you're following along, go ahead and hop into the engine and let's take a look at how the project is set up so that you can easily navigate through the folders. So now that we have the project open, we have something that looks a little bit like this. We'll see over here the content, which is typical for all Unreal Engine projects. But what is different in this case for this project is we have them all split up into individual modules so that we can go over each subject individually. So we'll start off with the class start, then we'll be headed into custom functions, alternate finger setup, aim head control, as well as finalizing and control types. And you will notice that in each folder there is a start and a done. This is here provided for you in case you're just following along in the video and you just want to take a look at the end result of what you should have set up. So what I would suggest doing is just go ahead and following along with the video and building your or constructing your control rig based off in each video set and then comparing what is in the done. So you might find you have a few errors and maybe something you forgot to check off. You'll be able to find it in the done module. OK, so this is just a basic overview of what we're headed into. So we're going to start off with our control rig with some class start, which we'll be taking a look at where we left off with control rig intro.",
