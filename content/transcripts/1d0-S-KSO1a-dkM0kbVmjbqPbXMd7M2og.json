  "text": " Because blueprints are essentially visualized C++, they have the same kind of hierarchical structure that you could expect from any object-orientated programming language. This means, of course, that they have classes. These classes have parent classes and child classes. And everything is derived from this core concept. So the blueprint acts as a sort of container for your script and everything else. This means that also the child classes can inherit functionality, components, and other parameters from their parent class. And along with this, they could have sibling classes that have slight tweaks and differences made to them, or additional information and additional components added to them. All this allows you to make your coding in Unreal much more modular.",
