  "text": " For this chapter, I just want to visually show why it's very important that your assets be authored at the highest quality possible and that you spend the extra time to make sure that they are well authored and that they look visually stunningly beautiful. So for that, if you go to your content classrooms, there is a beach scene in there. So I'm going to go ahead and just press G to go into game mode and just kind of fly down here and take a look. All right, so here we have our vehicle that we imported previously. And if you notice, it still has all of the default materials on it. Now, visually speaking, there's something kind of off about this scene, right? We've got this very beautiful kind of HDR backdrop. We've got lots of beautiful content. But yet the vehicle itself, while fundamentally looks correct, it looks like an Audi A5. We'll notice that it still doesn't feel very true to the scene. So what I'm going to do real fast is just go down inside of our collections. Now, again, if you don't see that, just go to view options, dock collections, and it should pop up. Now, if you don't see the sidebar, just click this little button right next to filters, which will hide and show your sources panel. And then again, go ahead and do dock collections. So I'm going to go ahead and go down to this car paint and I'll start going into this vehicle. Now, there's a couple of ways we can do this. I could select each of the little individual components within side of our stuff. So here's our SM car body, and I could assign the material directly to it via this way. However, I'm just going to take a little shortcut and just drag and drop. So I'm going to kind of get down here where I've got some of my specular reflections from the sun. I'm going to go ahead and just start dragging my paint onto the vehicle, onto just some of our various different sections. All right. So immediately we can start to see that it starts to look a lot better, starts to look more grounded. Let's continue with that process. I'll go in here and just select some of our glass. So I'll select it on, you know, our particular our headlights here. I'll put it on the view here. Let's go ahead and apply this to the other one. And then I'll look at some of these, what should be kind of chrome pieces. So I'll go down to I believe we have it underneath metal and I'm going to look for metal chrome. I'm going to go and just drag it onto our different assets. And then let's also look at, you know, possibly our wheels here. So I'm going to look, I believe we have this underneath. We can use metal frosted. That's fine. We'll go and apply this onto there. And let's add some of our chrome to some of our other pieces and fix some of this other paint that's here. There we go. Perfect. And then I'm just kind of kind of zoom in real close here. So you can actually go up to this camera movement, drop it way down or as you're moving forward and backwards. So I have my right mouse button clicked and I'm holding it and I'm kind of moving my W.A.S.D. keys back and forth. And if you middle mouse scroll up, it'll move much faster. And again, if you scroll down while having this all hold all held, you'll see that actually goes a little bit slower. So I'm going to go ahead and go into our headlights here, get right inside of that glass. And then I'm going to go back to our metal. I'm going to sign our chrome to here and then I'm going to go back to glass. And let's go ahead and do like windshield glass on there. Perfect. And I'll kind of zoom out here and then let's just kind of finish this process. I'm going to go down to rubber. I'm going to do the tire sidewall shiny. And then let's also do I believe we do have it under metal, caliper red and assign that to there. All right. So now if we zoom back out, in fact, let me go ahead. We'll just address these two right here. So I'll take the car paint here, drag it on top of there. And then we should be good. Yep, we've got chrome there. All right. Perfect. So I'm going to go back to our shot. And this would be a great chance just to go backwards in the video, just to see the before and the after. But hopefully this is evident enough in that, again, when you've authored your materials and they're very high quality, you're going to get a lot better results than if you just kind of use some default things. So, again, this is just me preaching to say that absolutely take the time and invest the effort into creating very high quality assets. Now, at this point, we can just completely ignore our baby blue default import for the vehicle, because everything we're going to be using after this point has been set up for you. So as you'll see in the maps that we're going to be using here in just a minute, if you click again on any of the car components that are included, you'll see that a lot of the materials have been changed to everything that we have included in these collections. All right, so let's go ahead and move on now to setting up our scene and making it look amazing.",
