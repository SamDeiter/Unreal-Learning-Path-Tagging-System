  "text": " Now we're going to take a look at the physics blending animation. We're going to utilize the very robust system within Unreal to create some animations based off from how our character reacts to his surroundings. So now ragdolls are straight out of the box within the very robust system within Unreal. So there's a couple ways that we're going to do this, but we're going to use the third person character to create these animations. First, let's take a look at a few things. So the two functions we're going to be using that look like nodes are the set all bodies below simulated physics and the set all bodies below physics blend weight. Now this set all bodies below simulate physics, we can completely have a limp ragdoll. In our case, we're going to create an animation eventually that will be controlling just the upper part so that it's just limp on the top. We're going to call that kind of like our the fun night out, but now I'm paying for it walk. So we'll get into that. But there's a few things we want to cover before we jump into the engine and create that. So we're going to take a look at the physics assets. Now why is this important? Physics assets are created when you first create a character in or you can create it afterwards that are capsules. Think of it like the Michelin man bouncing around in a room without these collision capsules or bubbles, whatever you want to call it. The character would walk through walls and wouldn't react as it would physically. It would also walk right through the floor. So these are built in order to react to the surroundings of the mannequin or any character for that matter. And we'll be using that like for creating a crazy walk and some other animation that you could do whatever you want. But we'll be doing a couple here in a bit. Before we begin, we need to do a little bit of pre set up. As you show here, we need to drag a couple of our manes, different versions and I'll tell you why in a minute. And we're going to change some settings. So let's go ahead and hop in to our object again. You're becoming hopefully quite familiar with. We're going to drag a couple of our characters. So let's go to the meshes. We're going to drag our SK mini. You can do simple or the regular. Either one's fine. And drag the regular one here. I'm going to focus in on them. I'm just going to kind of leave them or you can rotate them. I'm going to rotate them kind of towards the camera where the capsule is going to be. So you can see some stuff happen. And I'm going to drag the other man, which is under this mannequin UE4. Is that skeletal mesh? Drag them right in there and rotate them as well. Now the reason I am going to be using these different ones is because there are some already capable additions set up within each. Now this man, the older man, if you recognize him from Unreal Engine, has detachable. It works more like a robot. So for physics, that's going to come in kind of handy. But also this one, which is the newer mannequin, it's more organic. So if you stretch this arm out, it's not going to come apart. Whereas there's wood. We're not going to break them in that sense. But there's some other key things as well. This one has a control rig already attached to it. So that'll come in handy later. This one, however, does not. So instead of wasting time trying to get that connected, we're just going to show this one later. So let's go ahead and set some changes on here. So go ahead and click both of them, have the shift select. And what we want to look for is we need to turn on a few things in order for this to work for us. So first thing, we need to make sure that they are simulating physics. So if you go under here under physics, I'll look for that simulate physics right here. This is very important. If this is not activated, they will not react into the space or the world. We need them to do that. Now there's some other collision presets that we can do that we want to change those as well. I click that out of there. And we're going to type in collision. Again, spelling is important. We want to look for this here. This is physics actor. I don't want both of them to be physics actor. I'll explain that here in a minute. We want to make sure one is the other. So make sure you just select the stow. Do physics actor. And remember what settings that you're doing because you're going to want to pay special attention. So I'm going to make that Manny a rag doll. We'll make the old Manny the physics actor. So those are already preset. Now we're going to hit play. And this is going to interact with our capsule right here after you hit save. We're going to look here. And this is the as you saw, they already collapsed, which is the first part showing that they collapsed upon themselves because they became rag dolling, just reactive to physics. Now the difference in the physics actor in the rag doll is how they interact with our player's capsule or the player's player. So now let's run towards the Manny. If you remember what we had that setting, that was the rag doll. We did this one as the physics, you know, it runs right through it. So I'm going to hit escape and explain a little bit. So the physics actor, you can bump into the pond controller, which is our player controller. The rag doll, however, will ignore the pond's controller. So when we walk through the Manny, that was because rag doll will ignore the pond controllers. This can be very useful. For example, you don't want a player to ride the dead creature that they had just killed. Now if you did, then you would set it to the physics actor. So that's the two main differences. Now there are some other settings that you can choose, but for now, just know those are the two most important for what we're doing here today. Now that we played with the physics a little bit and saw how the character reacts to the player character, we're going to utilize that same concept in order to create an animation of how these mannequins are going to interact with the surroundings. So to do that, we're going to have to create a couple functions and tell it what to do via the mesh. Now the mesh itself has the animation blueprint connected to it. So it's a great way to interact with the character, tell the skeleton how you want it to interact with it. So we need to jump in to our Unreal Engine project. Now we're going to look for the animation blueprint, or rather the blueprint that's the level character print under Blueprints. I'm going to double click on that to make sure it's docked here. And you'll notice this network that's much like Blueprints, a little less like the animation blueprint. It's under the event graph. So what we're going to do is we're going to look for those functions we saw in our earlier text. So we're going to look for set all bodies below, long word, physics. And it's going to grab in the mesh. Now if yours doesn't, that's okay. We're essentially going to be doing this again. But to grab or rather to attach, you can just grab this right here, mesh and drag it in just like any component, like a blueprint, and you could connect that. Now it did come automatically, so that's okay. It saved us time. I wanted to show you that so you don't get confused as to where that comes from. I am going to go ahead and drag this in and connect. Let's go ahead and do that. I'm going to zoom in a little bit so you can see there. Make sure you set new simulate like that. I hit compile and save just for now. And if you're going to get an error, that's okay. Don't worry about that. We haven't connected a few things. One of them is the in bone. We haven't told it its references to what it is. In order to do that, we have to create a make literal name. I'm going to right click here. And the node you want again to create is the make literal, or you can even type literal name right there. That's a little function. I'm going to connect that into the in bone name because we're going to tell it what bone to control. In this case, I want it to operate in the spine underscore zero one. Everything from the spine zero one up is going to be controlled by this physics. If we were to hit play or simulate, bring up our window, we see the guy is collapsing, which is great. However, we'll notice running around the character does not look like it's reacting as a ragdoll. Now, a little pro tip. make sure that we change the collision type for this character. You type in collision. We come up here, you'll notice is that character mesh. That's not what we want. We want ragdoll so it responds to the physics around it. Don't you have that if you compile and save, we hit play. We now have the character that looks absolutely like they had way too much last night. This is good. This is the beginning of what we want. We want a little bit more control. We're going to add that additional function into our tree here. And that is going to be the physics blend weight. So right click in here and look for your set. Typing is very important. Spelling is always important. Physics blend weight. And there it is. So we're just going to have that mesh created or attached, which is fine. You can drag off from here and connect that way if you wish, or you can leave it how it's connected. Either way, we're making sure it's the same mesh that is in control. Go ahead, connect that. And then we still have to make sure it's the same bone name. So let's go ahead and drag that bone name to there. Yes, you can have it connected as many as you want. It's going to keep your network clean, your nodes clean. I'm going to hit compile, save. And everything should look correct, right? So let's hit play. You'll notice now it's no longer controlling. That again is because we don't have any type of physics weight blending. So right now it's set to zero. So we're telling it to not do anything. I would say don't go above five. Which has been kind of a not an arbitrary number per se, but it's a number that we have worked with and felt that it works well for us. But I'm going to start it at point three. So more than welcome to adjust this. Hit compile and save again. Hit play again. Now we got a little less zombie or a little less how much or what did I do last night kind of thing. It's a little bit more control. So again, if you want to, you can change this all the way up to point five. Now all this is mean is point three means I'm taking away 30% of the original animation's curve value and giving it to the physics to drive the animation by 30%. So it would be the same thing for point five. So if you want a little bit more taken away and given to that, change it to point five. I'll hit play again. And now we got a lot more bending there at the spine zero one. Dot Quinn does not know what is going on here. Okay, so we have it up to that point and that's what we want to see. We're going to take this a little bit further and we're going to do physical character animation and we're going to prepare to record. So we're going to have to do some ragdoll effects or we're going to drop them in order to create some cut scenes of them falling.",
