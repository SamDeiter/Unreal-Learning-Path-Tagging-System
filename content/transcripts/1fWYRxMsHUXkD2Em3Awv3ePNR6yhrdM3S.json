  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to go ahead and take those layered materials and even show you how to adjust a few things to be able to get to different parts of those materials and textures to be able to get different looks. We're going to put those all in the parent material and we can actually see what our final output is going to be. So let's get started. So one thing I want to point out is you saw that we connected our RGB on that last layered material and we went in here and we controlled it in such a way and I should say with a third layer blend material that we grabbed the RGB into the A channel. Now you can, as my example shows, you can use the green channel if you want or the red channel. It depends what you want to mask out because if we double click on this texture we can actually see different values. Let's pull this across and dock it here. You can see different values and strengths that may occur in each one of these channels. Now this guy's pretty black and white but we're going to grab some of that information according to what we need. Now you can even bring in a color one. It can have mask channels in here for packing. That also can be a great way to be able to optimize things. If you're not familiar with that you got to kind of dial back a little bit back to when we talked about our materials and I believe the second material class that you had and I showed you how to pack UVs. We can actually paint into each UV channel. I can paint into the green channel. I can paint in the blue. I can paint into any channel that I choose and it actually makes it pretty easy. In our particular case because there's probably a bit more of a stronger texture in here. We're going to go and grab or a contrast. We're going to grab the green and put it into the A channel. He's a black and white so it really doesn't have a lot going on in those channels but again I wanted to point that out that you can pack these in such a way and you can paint on a different channel. Bring it in here and use that as an alpha which could be genius and save a bit of time especially if you're recycling reducing and reusing that texture on several different levels. That actually can work pretty well to your advantage. Let's go ahead and apply and let's go ahead and go to our parent material. So if we go back to the folder that we created and we'll go to our demo and we'll go to our parent material here. There we go demo parent. Let's double click on that. He's off screen. Let me pull him over. So what we need to do is need to adjust a few things so we can use this parent material to our advantage. Now again the one thing I do want to keep I want you to keep in mind when you're working with these material layers and parent materials just make sure you're keeping things a bit organized and what I mean by that you want to make sure that you know where everything's at any particular place and you want to make sure that you're not making these. I mean you can make the layers pretty complicated but like I said try to pack textures when you can and try to be very deterministic of what you need. You don't want to necessarily bog these layers down in a particular material because it doesn't optimize things in the fact it doesn't make it lighter. It just makes things a little bit more easier to use and organize so it doesn't lower the size of the material per se. Keep that in mind. All right. So I just want to emphasize that point because it's really important to consider those things. So what we need to do now let's go ahead and make a material attribute layer so material attribute layers there it is and we want to collapse this because we're going to make sure that we're using the information jumping into here and not using anything erroneous or extra here because we really are not deriving anything from the original nodes that are set up. We're going to be using the nodes that we build on our material layers and material blend. So I'm going to go ahead and click on that or click on the grid and we're going to say hey use material attributes and we're going to pull this right into here. What we want to do is go into material attributes and do some adjustments. We'll see at the top here that we have a default layer. So let's click on this once and open this up. You'll see that we have two slots. We have one for our background and then one for our layer. And we're going to mainly focus on that for our example. We got to remember the names of our stuff. There's quite a bit of things in here. So let's go ahead and low and load what our background is going to be. This is going to be a material layer. So we'll just load this as the tile. So we'll type this in M L underscore new tile. There we go. Grab that. And then we're going to need that layer that's going to be on top. That's going to be our grunge. So we're going to click on this. We're going to go to M L underscore new grunge. There you go. Click on that. We're going to need our blend material. So let's get that blend asset. The one we made was M L B to demo. So let's go and type that in M L B underscore new demo. There it is right there. So cool. So we have this all set up now and we are ready to go. Now again, we can add more layers here or in the instance. And what I mean by that is let's actually find this guy. Let's right click, upset, apply. Make sure it applies. There we go. Updates it. Right click on it. And we're going to say create a material instance. In this material instance, typically you can put MI or put INST. Sometimes they leave INST. It just depends on how big my name is. If it's really long, I'll just do MI. So I'll double click on this. Let's pull this over. There we go. And in here, we can see our background, our layer asset. And we can open up all the things that we have in place. Pretty cool. There's our layer. There's our scalar values and normal grime intensity. We didn't put it in a group. That's why it didn't show up. We have a contrast grunge, contrast intensity for that. But we don't have anything for the foundation for the tile. So it's just totally fine. So now we can go in here and we can adjust some of these. And if we want to, there's a quick button here to be able to add another element. We can actually add a quick material layer and then populate it if you've already created those MLs or material layers ready to go. So let's go and see it in our scene. I'm going to move this over. And it's really just going to replicate what we have here. And I think I might have even flipped them in here where the base is the grunge and the layer is the brick. You can totally do that. Or tile, I should say. It's up to you. Let's go and find this guy. Let's apply him to our scene. There we go. Drag him on there. And then now we can control our contrast if we want to. Ooh, nice. We can control our grunge amount. And we can bleed that through. Pretty cool. Either way works great. This one's a little bit crisper with the defined edges. This one does a little bit more blending. It may work for you. It's actually kind of like what it's given us. So that's not too shabby. So we can increase that or decrease it. That's up to you how you want to do it. It kind of fades nicely into each other. So you can see that we're still using that alpha information, getting bits and parts of that grunge coming through. Cool. So that's it with this one. Hopefully, you learned a lot on the new way to be able to create your layer blends. What we're going to do in the next video is we're going to take a look at NPCs and see how they work. Thanks again.",
