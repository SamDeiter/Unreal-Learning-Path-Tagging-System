  "text": " With the context of what virtual production is out of the way, let's think about how we translate film into Unreal Engine Sequencer and the different terminologies that we might use to overlap these workflows. So on the left-hand side we've got film and on the right-hand side we've got the Unreal Engine workflow. So let's think about film in terms of the master scene techniques, which is getting your master shots and your coverage cameras. It's a linear workflow in that respect. And then we've got triple take techniques, which is overlapping the action or the nonlinear type of approach and then hitting specific marks in your blocking or whatever approach you're taking there. And then you've got the traditional live action production where you have gaffers and grips and production managers and a full series of people on the production here. And then when we think about the Unreal Engine workflow, we've got the sequence-based linear workflow, which is just one level sequence. You capture this entire sequence in one sequence. You have multiple cameras inside this sequence. You may also use a single camera track. So that's a linear workflow. And then you've got the shot-based nonlinear workflow, which is almost like a nested level sequence. And then you have the take system and sub scene tracks, which are optional. But as I was mentioning in the previous video, how you can kind of nest these sequences inside of each of the shots, it's almost like a modular approach to the shot-based workflow here. And then when we talk about the artist collaborative workflow here, we've got sub levels and sub scenes and tracks and visibility tracks and source control. And all these features allow multiple people to be working on these productions at the same time. So source control, where you may be storing all your files in the cloud and people can be grabbing them. Say you move some information around. Again going back to the lighting or the rock example that we used in a previous video, you may change the sun direction or scale some rocks and you can then commit them to the source control and someone else can pull them down and get the updates. Essentially, not real time, but close to real time. As soon as they pull the content, it's there and ready to use. So there's just a lot of powerful functionality there. And so when we think about terminology as well, in film, we may have location scouting and filming in these locations, whereas Unreal Engine, it's all housed inside of a project. On the film side, we have stages, which we use to shoot the action. And in Unreal Engine, you have levels, which is more of a terminology from the video game industry, which we use here. And the levels are the virtual production stages, essentially. We have sets in film, which in Unreal Engine, we have sub levels. So you have these large persistent levels, which is the point that I made before just on levels. So they're almost like the master level. And then you can have these sub levels, if you think about them as almost like layers in Photoshop or any other programs like that, where you can still have content. It's not in the main document, but it's still visible in the sub levels. You can have content on sub levels inside of Unreal Engine. When you have props and actors inside of film, you have SK and SM meshes or actors, which are skeletal meshes and static meshes. Real is anything with bone data and static meshes or any 3D static geometry. In film, we have crews, lights, cameras, rigging, practical effects. And in Unreal Engine, we have components and blueprints and C++ code and control rig in Niagara. So we'll be digging into some of this terminology later down the line, but just to give some The rigging, especially in film, the control rig is a tool inside of Unreal Engine where you can actually animate any boned characters. You can capture their performances inside of Unreal Engine or you can animate directly inside of Unreal Engine and save out those performances to use in your projects. And then the practical effects, Niagara is the latest visual effects tool inside of Unreal Engine, which if you've heard of Cascade, which was a previous tool, this is now the main feature to use inside of Unreal Engine. When we've been referring to Sequencer, we're talking about a nonlinear editing tool. So you can ground up shot create, you can pre-visualize scenes, you can create full films inside of Sequencer. And we also use it in games for cinematic creation. So there's additional resources at the bottom of the page if you'd like to know more about Sequencer, but essentially you can think about it as a nonlinear editing tool where it houses all the content of your cinematic or your short film or a full film. It can house all the data inside there and you can see a bunch of buttons that we can click and we can change the frame rate of the scene. We can do camera fades and cuts and all this kind of thing, which we'll be digging into in a workshop in a little while. When we look at the tools and features of Sequencer, thinking about a level sequence, we use that for cinematic sequences. So these level sequences can be nested together. So if we use the take system, you might have this film, which is the master level sequences, the parent sequence of everything that you're doing inside this scene. And then you can also have these level sequences, which are almost sub sequences inside of the master. So these are the individual sections that you want to use to edit the content together. And then you can put shots within side these sequences. So you can have shot one and shot two and multiple takes and you may have a variant of a few different takes happening. And then you can stitch that content together inside of Sequencer. So essentially, Sequencer is a powerful almost nesting tool where you can get as fine grain as going down to an individual key on a camera pan all the way to the high level kind of what is this film? I can see how long these shots are and where the music's coming in and out. And it's up to you how you can organize your content in this respect. When thinking about translating the film into Unreal Engine, we'll look at some terminology. So film, which could be a feature or a shot is a collection of sequences, commonly a three act structure to create some form of narrative. Whereas inside of Unreal Engine, as we mentioned before, we think about this as a level sequence, which is still the master film. So it's a collection of all the organized nested level sequences creating an entire film. When you think about your acts, which is a basic structural division of film storytelling, which collects several sequences per act, you have the level sequences, which is the narrative structure organization of the nested sequence, which we're getting more granular and more granular as we go. A sequence in film, a larger section of narrative film where an act is composed of several scenes. In Unreal, the level sequence is a collection of nested level sequences placed in non-linear order on the shot track. When we have scenes, we have a section of sequence in a single location and time composed of several shots. Again, in Unreal, you can have a level sequence, which is a collection of sequences placed in linear order on the shots track. When we have shots in film, which is a single selected take of, it can be any duration without interruption used in the scene creation. In Unreal Engine, we can have a single level sequence of varying duration and camera cuts used within that scene creation as well. So you can have multiple camera cuts within a single shot. When we think about takes in film, which is a single continuous performance of a varying duration in order to create the shot, we again can use level sequence and it's a duplicate level sequence used to create variations of the shots in level performance. So there's a very analogous kind of terminology going on where you can think of this sequencer as the way to house all of your cinematic content and you can then nest and create sub level sequences of the higher level sequences. If we think about some terminology that we might be hearing over the course of this video, but also as you continue your journey inside of Unreal Engine, when you think about static and skeletal meshes, as I mentioned before, a static mesh doesn't necessarily have to be static in your scene because we can create movable objects in the scenes. Static refers to the fact that you won't be manipulating this in any way. It's not a piece of cloth simulation. It may be a rock or a boulder. So this boulder might be rolling down the hill. Now it could be a static mesh, which is rolling down the hill, but it's not going to be deformed in any way. It's not going to be rigged for any purpose. It's just a static mesh. Whereas a skeletal mesh will always have some kind of bone data. Even if it's just a single root bone, it will always have some kind of bone data. When we have actors, pawns and characters, so actor is always the highest level of content inside of Unreal Engine. So an actor is actually essentially part of everything inside of Unreal Engine. So a light is an actor, a static mesh is an actor, a tree would be an actor. Everything inside of Unreal Engine is based around the concept of an actor. A pawn is something that houses potential information for controlling some form of character data. So a pawn could still be a vehicle. It could be a character that moves around, but a pawn will generally be able to handle input and it's something based on video game terminology there. Whereas characters then can be a child of that pawn. So a character might be someone that moves around the scene. And if you think about the hierarchy that we've just gone off there, everything in the world is an actor, which can then be created a child class of an actor to create a pawn and then maybe a child class of a pawn can be a character. When we think about the worlds and the maps and the levels, there's not a huge amount of difference inside of Unreal Engine when you create a new world to call it a map, to call it a level. This terminology can be interrelated. That being said, you may run into some edge cases where we create levels inside of Unreal Engine like we were creating our level sequences, but you can then create sub levels. Levels and maps generally can be interrelated. You may hear some things about world partition. So these are large open worlds that you might be using for these large grand cinematic sequences or large game productions. But essentially that terminology can be interrelated there. We have the level sequences, which we've gone into enough detail in the previous few slides. We've got control rig, which I briefly touched upon before, but we can essentially get the rig data of a humanoid character. It could be a car. It could be anything that you want to animate. You can create a control rig. If said actor, again using that word actor, has any kind of bone data, so it would have to be a skeletal mesh, going back to that first terminology that we learned. But as long as you have a skeletal mesh in the world that has some kind of skeleton setup, then you can use control rig to create your own animations inside of Unreal Engine, which is a really powerful tool. We have volumes, which can be used for a whole range of things. You may have lighting volumes where you want to focus certain lighting effects within this volume. You have post-processing volumes where inside a given volume, you can color grade your scene or add some post-process materials. You have blocking volumes, which will create pawns or characters in your map to not be able to go past a certain point because you've put a blocking volume there. Blowing volumes can be used in many, many different instances, but it'll be some kind of geometric data that you can put into your map. We also have blueprints, which is Unreal Engine's visual scripting system based on C++. So we can create basic blueprints. You can create complex blueprints as well, but in virtual production, you can create some really cool basic blueprints that you might want to add UI to your shots, or you may want to toggle on some kind of lighting information or create a particle effect. Blueprints can be really powerful in this instance just to give you some more control over your scene. Then we also have source control integration inside of Unreal Engine. So if you're creating content and sharing it across multiple users and you have a larger production, even if you have a solo production, source control is very useful to commit to the cloud or the server, whatever content you're working on, because if hard drive's corrupt or you lose information, it's still in the cloud. So source control is a really good way of keeping revisions of your data as well. And then lastly, thinking about some new terminology in terms of possessable and spawnable actors. So we can possess actors, we can possess cameras and characters, and we can move them around the scene once we possess them. So if we possess a character with some control input, you can actually move that character through the scene and around the scene. And if you so wanted to, you could use take recorder, which we referenced at the start the video, you could use a take recorder to record your performance as a character and then play that back in a cinematic, which again has a lot of powerful functionality because the animation system is handling all of that information and then you can just record it and play it back without having to hand key everything of the performance. We also have spawnable actors, which you can spawn these actors at runtime. So say you want a camera to only live in this one shot and you don't want to bloat the entire sequence or level with loads of different camera actors, you can actually spawn them per shot if you'd like. Same with any other content such as lights, if you wanted to spawn some rim lighting for a certain cinematic sequence on a character, you could do that per shot instead of having these lights left around for the entire of the cinematic sequence, you know, in case a rim lighting one shot looks really good and then it affected another shot in some way, you could just spawn them in per shot and really take care of the fine control of that sequence. So hopefully that's a good amount of terminology to just get you familiar with the workflows inside of Unreal Engine.",
