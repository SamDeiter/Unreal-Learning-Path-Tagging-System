  "text": " Okay, let's begin to wrap things up with a few final recommendations. And we'll begin with Project Organization. As you can see in this slide, there are levels and sublevels that allow for better organization and collaborative compartmentalization. So your environment, or your persistent level, will contain anything that is universally shared within the entire project. Asset, environments, or discipline-specific setups can live on their own sublevels, and to clarify, when I'm talking about levels, I'm referring to maps or worlds. I do not mean level sequences. There is a difference between these two assets. Levels get organized into sublevels and live under your persistent level depending on what is actually needed for your project or departments. For example, your main lighting setup should live on your persistent level, as that will be utilized by the entire project or production. Any level sequence-specific lighting setup should live in a sequencer lighting comp sublevel so that any spotable lighting that is specific to that level sequence will be contained in that specific lighting comp sublevel. That way, the lighting that is in that sublevel can get called in and out by the sequencer without affecting the persistent level and causing problems between users working with the persistent level when the sequencer-specific lighting comp turns on or off the lighting in that sublevel. Additionally, level visibility tracks in Sequencer allows you to turn on and off the visibility of the assets in each of the sublevels so that they don't always have to be active, and that will help reduce engine resource usage. Now, I want to take a moment to emphasize just how important project organization is. Without it, things can get really messy very fast, so I highly recommend creating nested folders and folder structures inside your Content Browser and inside your Outliner to maintain project organization as you work. Another important factor in organizing level sequences is that actors within a level sequence can be divided into one of two categories, Possessable and Spawnable. Spawnable actors are intended to be possessed by each level sequence that calls them into use, but ultimately, they belong to the level or sublevel and are active in that level the entire time. Spawnable actors, on the other hand, exist within the unique level sequence and then disappear when the level sequence is outside of its play range or no longer active. Basically, a spawnable is like pulling a book down from a bookshelf, reading the instructions, and then putting the book back on the shelf to use again as needed. Each of these can prove beneficial depending on your needs and workflows, but one thing to note is that the EPO storyboarding tools do not currently support spawnable actors at this time. Another actor class that has a profound impact on setting up action in Unreal Engine is the use of a Subscene Track. A Subscene Track essentially references an existing level sequence for the express purpose of layering multiple actions together. This type of organization allows you to create departmentalized level sequences so that teams of artists can work together in real time to construct distinct portions of the action on a project based on department or discipline. As I mentioned earlier, these can be utilized in conjunction with a project's sublevel organization. Just as we discussed for the lighting scenarios, cinematography can also do this for cine cameras. Character animation can have its own subscene, so all your characters and animations can live on an animation-specific sublevel as well. Level blueprints or level sequence blueprints, level sequence-specific effects, anything that could be spawnable or triggered can also live on a sublevel under the persistent level, and also be organized in Sequencer through subscenes. One thing to note is that while subscene organization works well for most departmental organization, it does not work with storyboarding tools at this time. Attempting to use the subscene for storyboards will cause the engine to crash. Finally, when working with animation in Sequencer, you might find it helpful to create folders or assets inside Sequencer to keep the Event Manager tidy, or use groups for assets while animating. Just be aware that the Groups window does not dock to any part of Unreal Engine, so you will need to keep this window open. Oh, and one more thing. When animating or working in Unreal Engine, you can use the F10 key to isolate selected control rig controls or isolate any tab you have active in the engine. F10 acts as a toggle, so if you accidentally dock all your tabs, don't worry, just hit F10 again and restore your viewport. Oh, remember, try to work non-destructively by duplicating any animation asset before making any major changes. Okay, that's it for this section. In our next section, we'll continue with more of our final recommendations.",
