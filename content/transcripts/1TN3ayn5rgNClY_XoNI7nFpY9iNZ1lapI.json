  "text": " Okay, it's time to talk about physics. The awesome thing about using a game engine is that if you have a scene where your character is near an explosion and they need to be flailing in the air, you don't have to animate that by hand. And if your VisFX guide changes the intensity of the explosion, you don't have to redo the animation again. The engine handles all of that for you. So for starters, I'm going to hop over into the engine. I just want to go to the Place Actors tab in the top left and bring in a sphere into the level. And the Place Actors tab, it's just where you can find the generic building blocks for your scene. And if I hit End, then the sphere will land on the floor very nicely. Now if I hit Play, not a whole lot happens. Just bump into it, but it doesn't really move anywhere. So to enable the physics, I go to the Details panel, and then I just go down to the Physics section and check on Simulate Physics. So if I hit Play, this time it actually moves. Wee! Cool. So I'll hit Escape. And then Reset. Okay. Now, another thing is the Unreal Engine, it assumes that large objects are really heavy and small objects are really light. But if you have a really large Styrofoam something, you might want to change that. So if you check on Mass in Kilograms, and let's say I change this to 5 kilograms instead, and hit Play. Wee! Now that's more fun. So we're playing soccer, or football, depending on which part of the world you're in. Okay. So if I reset my camera, I'm just going to Alt-drag and create a couple more spheres to add to the playpen. So we'll try that. Now, to get back to our character, I want you to take a look at Mannequin Character Mesh folder. You might already be in there. And then double-click on the SK Mannequin Physics asset. It should be a peach on the bottom. Spheres. And if you hit Simulate, this shows you what the character would look like with physics turned on, and it's quite amusing. Now these purple capsules help the engine understand if your character is colliding with something or not. And the volumes are constrained to different bones in the hierarchy. And then you can even control the bend or swing or twist limit when they get hit. So let's go back to the third-person example map. And let's bring in a new SK Mannequin asset. And then in the world outliner, I just want to rename it so we don't get confused. So I'm going to double-click and do Edit, Rename. Call it SK Mannequin underscore physics so that it is clear. So if we go to the physics section of the Details panel, right here. Now I'm going to check on Simulate Physics, and then there's one more thing we're going to do. Keep going down to Collision and go to Collision Presets. And I want you to change that to Ragdoll. Now Ragdoll, I just want you to think of a marionette puppet and how it flops around as a result of the puppeteer manipulating the strings from above. And if you look at these different collision presets and you have no idea what the difference is between all of them, you can actually go to Edit, Project Settings, and then go to Engine, Collision. And if you expand the Presets section and click on any one of these, if you hit Edit, you can look at the different settings and compare them. So I think that's pretty helpful. I'll close that for now. So if I hit Play, he flops. So that's just what we saw in the physics asset. This is a little boring, so let me create some objects to make this more interesting. So I will Alt, click drag this ramp and move it over. I'm going to scale it and rotate it so that my guy can slide off of it. And then I want to move him up and over so that he's above the ramp. And let me move him high so we can get some nice falling action. Okay, we'll try that for now. Now if I hit Play, he falls and flops and probably has a very bad headache. And then if I hit Escape, and we're back to where we were. Now another thing I want to tweak is I don't want to be limited by the third person view, at least for what we're doing right now. So let's change this to simulate. And then hit Stop. And so the next time maybe I move to right here, I can see more of the action from here. And oof. And I'm actually I'm going to move some of these circles. See if I can get more interaction. Let me try that. But who knows. But we can also record this motion too. And as of the Engine version 4.27, the Take Recorder plugin, it should be enabled. So if we go to Window, Cinematics, Take Recorder, the Take Recorder tab pops open as well as the sequencer. And if for some reason you don't already have it, you can go to Settings, Plugins, type in Take and enable it and then it will ask you to restart the engine. And then after you do that, you'll be good. Alright, so let's take a look at Take Recorder. First thing we need to do is add a source to be recorded. So I can grab our Physics Manny and click the plus source from Actor, Add SK Mannequin Physics. Or you can add multiple things at a time. So if I shift click these different spheres, I can again plus source from Actor and then you can see that four actors are selected. Click on that. And now we have some things that we're recording. And if we click the gears icon in the top right, we get a bunch of settings. You can change where the takes are saved or how they are named. You can change the names of different tracks that get added to the recorded sequence. And if we jump down to the user settings, I want to change the countdown so that it's easier to record. I want to change it to zero so we don't have this three, two, one before the record actually starts. So now we are ready. And the recording process, it's a little particular. First you have to hit play. Then you have to hit F8 to get your mouse control back so that you can then hit the record button. And you want to do that as quickly as you can so you don't miss anything. Once you're done, make sure you hit stop and let's give it a try. I will hit play, F8, record, and stop. I was a little slow on that one so let's do that again. And to give myself more time, I'm going to make him even higher. So here we go. Play F8, record. And hit stop. And then third time's the charm. Play F8, record. There we go. Now I got more of his ball. And hit stop. Now every time I hit stop, the sequencer, it goes blank. And if you go up to this icon that looks like a film strip and an eyeball, it says review the last recording. Go ahead and click on that. And you'll see a couple scene tracks. And there's also a red outline around each of these scene tracks. And by default, they're locked. So if you click the padlock icon to unlock them, you can actually double click and go inside the scene track now. So I'll go inside the SK Mannequin one. And if I click in the sequencer and hit the spacebar, we can see Mannequin and his very rough time. I mean, there we go. And the purple track, it has his animation. I can actually right click on it, go to properties, and I can double click on the animation square. We see that the animation, it's all in place. Looks kind of funny. And then if I go out of that tab and I come back, if I click on the transform track, we can see that his path is actually keyframed separately on the transform track. So if you want to tweak them independently, you can. If I wanted to, I could actually try to delete some of these keyframes. If I didn't like that section and then. There you go. But I'll undo that control Z. So we have all of our keyframes. And if you do need these two to be combined where you have the path and the flailing together, you can right click on the SK Mannequin physics track and bake the animation sequence. So that's physics assets and take recorder. In the next video, we will build on this and we will use blueprints to turn on the physics behavior instead.",
