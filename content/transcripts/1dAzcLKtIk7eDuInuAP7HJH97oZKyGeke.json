  "text": " Hi everyone, in this lesson we're going to take a look at NPCs and how they work overall and why using them. And then in the following video we'll actually break it down and make one ourselves. So let's get started. So first up, many people wonder what is a material parameter collection? What they are is they allow us to go in here and to be able to adjust things sweepingly in a material to be able to control the properties and the look and feel. They can range from anything from making flowers die to changing the color of them or to make them look like they're more wet. I'm going to show you the example that I have. The NPC is active and a little bit about how they work in the scene and then in the following video we'll actually do it ourselves. So let's go and jump into Unreal and take a look. So here in Unreal we have a scene set up and this is using the NPC underscore mat. If you're wondering where that's at, go into your class files. You'll see on your class files under maps, you'll see the NPC mat. That's the one that I have open here. We're going to also go ahead and open up our cinematics. Let's go to contents, open up cinematics folder and we're going to go ahead and open up our NPC simple animation. In here we can go ahead and hit play and as we hit play we can actually see things change over time. I'm just simply sliding over the bar and you can see the materials get wetter and the rain appear in the opacity here. Now this is all being able to be controlled via an NPC. We can add whatever actors that we need and then we can also when we do that load a material parameter collection connected to that actor as you see in my menu. The NPCs if we go to that folder where they're found allow us to be able to affect the materials the way that we need. Now if we go to these objects let's actually pick on the statue here and we go ahead and go to where it's found in the scene. We're going to double click on the material that we have in place and you'll see we have one called NPC here. The NPCs are nested in this material but we also have the NPC built right alongside it. If we double click on the NPC you'll see that we have an area here for scalar to be able to control range and we have vector if we wanted to control color. We'll do this in the other video where we'll actually build both of these out. So if we go into our scene itself let me minimize this for a second and we go ahead and take a look at this material the NPC one. I'm going to click on the magnifying glass for it and just double click on that material. You'll see that we have a global roughness high and it's driving our multiply here. And we also have a an NPC here for global roughness low and wetness both punched into a multiply which actually can work pretty well. This just allows us to control the range on or off in a particular if we want to go high or low with this particular look. Now I'm using it in the specular you don't have to but you do have to be careful and I'll show this in the next video between specular and roughness because one can turn the other one off. That's something you just have to be aware of when working with Unreal. You'll notice that our global roughness high is punched into the A channel you can also punch that into the B channel and in here we have a roughness texture set in place. Now these now once are loaded in sequencer allow us to be able to control the look and feel of our objects in our scene. Well that's it with this video in the next video we're going to go and build these out and you're going to see them applied in the scene and see how they work. Thanks again.",
