  "text": " So zooming out a little bit from the player related stuff, there's a set of classes that we should talk about that are regarded under what is strictly called the Unreal Gameplay Framework that apply more to the world than a specific player that we should just talk about a little bit. So those are the Game Mode, the Game State and the Game Instance. Starting with the Game Mode, as the name might imply, this is kind of the rules of the game, the kind of more static data about the game. There might be things like how many players are there, how many players are allowed to join this game, where might those players spawn, how many points do you need to win the game, and quite importantly for both online and single player games, the Game Mode also specifies the default classes that we're going to spawn for each of these things. So it specifies your default player classes, it specifies the player controller class to spawn for each player. Moving on from that, we have the Game State. If you think about this as the real time state of the game, in the context of a networked game, the Game Mode is going to be server only, it's going to be authoritative, but the Game State is actually a replicated actor. So the Game State is the shared real time state of that game between both the server and the client. So if we took Capture the Flag game as an example, the Game Mode would specify maybe how many points you need to score, but the actual current score would be something we store in the Game State, so that can be replicated across all the clients so everyone has an up-to-date idea of what the current score is. The third class that we need to talk about is the Game Instance, and this is for storing our persistent data throughout an entire gameplay session. Whilst the Game Mode and the Game State are destroyed and respawned every time we transition level, obviously we would want our score to reset to zero, right, and when we're going from one level to a different level, maybe we've gone from the shooter level to the car driving Game Mode, so we have different default pawns and things like that. Whereas we want that stuff to kind of get, we intentionally want it to be torn down and rebuilt, the Game Instance is where we're going to store things that persist between those levels. So say, for example, we start a game and client one chooses to be on Team Red, we want some way to store data that is going to persist between two levels, right, they should still be on Team Red when they go into level two, and therefore that's something that we might do in the Game Instance. So just as a kind of visual demonstration of this same thing happening, we have this kind of imagining a multiplayer game setup here, we have level one, the Game Mode, again only on our server because it's authoritative, the rules of the game are defined there, and the clients don't need to worry too much about them. The game state exists on the server and is replicated to our clients, but both our client and our server have their own instances, and as we go from level one to level two, the server Game Instance remains and the client Instance remains, they don't communicate with each other, but they are persistent between levels. And again, here you can see that when we start level two, we get a second Game Mode and we get a second Game State because the Game Mode, the Game State may have changed. Talking a little bit more about how we actually specify that Game Mode, there's a couple of different ways we could do this, we can go into the default engine in our configs and specify our Game Mode here, so when you want to set the kind of default Game Mode for your game, you can do that here through the Inni files, most of the time when you have an Inni file and it's got fields you can edit, you can edit it in a kind of more visually easy to pass kind of way inside the engine through the project settings, so in the project settings maps and mode section, there's a default Game Mode there. But the other thing you can do is specify a different Game Mode per level, like we said, maybe in one level you're running around in first person shooter mode and maybe for another level you're driving cars, so that's something you can actually override in the world settings of each level. Beyond worrying about just the kind of more static data present in Game Mode, there is a bit of functionality that is worth being concerned about. The other thing to mention is that when we're making a Game Mode, when we're making a class that inherits from Game Mode, there's actually two points we can branch from. There's the Game Mode base class, which as the name kind of would imply is the base class for Game Mode, and then there is a class called Game Mode, which inherits from Game Mode base. Game Mode essentially implements some additional multiplayer specific functionality on top of Game Mode base, so if you're making a single player standalone game, it's quite likely you'll want your Game Mode classes to inherit from Game Mode base, not the Game Mode class. So there's a set of virtual functions available to both of these that are just worth talking a little bit about. There is a lot more than these, but these are just some kind of really common ones you want to utilize. In It Game is called really, really early in the game flow, and it's kind of like our initial kickoff point. It's called before we even initialize components, and it's essentially a point where we initialize any just super early data that we need to be a certain way before anything else begins. Then kind of from that point onwards, we're going to talk about things that are fired specifically on a per-player basis. So first we have pre-login. This is essentially responsible for possibly rejecting a player's connection, so this is before that player actually exists in that game. It's kind of worth mentioning that there's kind of a non-trivial amount of time, or possibly non-trivial amount of time, between the pre-login functionality and the actual login function for that player, especially if that player has a lot of content they need to download. There might be quite a long time between those two things. Post-login is the point at which we have succeeded logging in. Nothing's gone wrong with our download process. Our player has been accepted. So this is the first point where we can actually say, yes, this player is in this game. They'll have a player controller at this point, so this might be the point where you display some kind of UI to say, hey, this person has joined the game. Next we go on to handling starting a new player. So this is once that player has started the game, we need to go through this process of kind of like injecting them into the actual game mode, and that's where handle start new player kind of comes in. At this point, you might be doing something like assigning them a team to be on, and there might be certain data that extrapolates from that. And then handle starting player would then call eventually restart player, but obviously from the name, as the name implies, restart player is also called several times if your character dies. So restart player gets called in with your player controller, and it's the responsibility of the ability of restart player to perform a bunch of functionality about choosing a pawn for that player and spawning it in that place. That will eventually then call spawn default pawn at transform. By default, that's just going to default back to what the game would specify as a default pawn, but this is passed in with the player controller. So if for some reason, say for example, that player chose a character before they entered this level, you could specify specifically for this player controller spawning this character rather than the game modes default pawn. And then after all of that, those last two functions are going to be called multiple times as that player possibly dies and gets respawned. But finally, when that player chooses to leave, when they either leave or the player is destroyed, on logout is called. And this might be the point at which you want to display to other players that player has left the game. Then that's kind of shared functionality between the two of them. Game mode specifically, like we said, it's kind of more specifically geared to multiplayer games. Hypothetically, any of those things might be useful even in a single player game because might join that map for the first time and you still want to edit some of this functionality. Game mode specifically, the kind of more multiplayer centric one has access to this concept of match states. And you'll see that game mode itself overrides some of these functions. So say for example, handle starting new player, where game mode essentially just asks a couple of questions about whether or not we should be spawning that player's pawn in. One of the things game mode will check against is whether or not we're waiting to start. Waiting to start might be an example of our classic waiting for more players screen. So the game is technically starting, but there's just not enough players to start this game running. So game mode has an additional check for are we in waiting to start? If so, then don't spawn like their default pawn, maybe spawn a spectator spawn or something like that. As we mentioned, there's a couple of different states available to us. We're entering the map, meaning things are starting up, waiting to start. So when we're waiting for other players in progress, as you expected, the game is ongoing. Waiting post-match is people might be reviewing their scores, might be voting on the next map to go to, and leaving map is when we're transitioning into the next level. Game state is, as we already mentioned a little bit, is really for our game's runtime, real-time data. So it doesn't have so much in the way of functionality. It's not such a heavy class in terms of things we would need to override. It's really just a place we should feel quite comfortable to put any data that we want to be, that is broadly game-wide, that we want to be communicated to each of the players. It's worth mentioning, though, specifically, that this is not on a per-player basis. So this is the kind of global data for all the players to see. If we're worrying about data on a per-player basis, that's handled somewhere else, which is the player state, which we'll get onto next. So we mentioned very briefly about player-specific data. This isn't quite on, this isn't one of those classes that we mentioned before, but just because we're talking about replicating data across the server, it's worth touching briefly on the player state. Much like the game state, the player state is intended for holding the, hence the name, state of our player. If we kind of look at an example setup here, we've got the server for our game. That server would have a player controller for player one and a player controller for player two. It would also have state for each of those players. Now whilst the server kind of contains all of this stuff, our clients would actually see a slightly restricted view, where each client sees their own player controller, and they don't see every other player's player controller. That's what player state is for. So a little bit like game mode to game state, player state is the same thing in reflection to... Oh my god, I've lost the flow there. So whereas the game state is for the game-wide state that is going to be shared information across all players, for player-specific information, that's where we would come to the player state. If we kind of just take an example setup here, we have the server. For each client connected to the server, the server is going to spawn in a player controller and a player state. If we look at each of these clients, however, a client sees their own player controller, but they don't see other clients' player controllers. So client one doesn't see client two's player controller, client two doesn't see player one's player controller. So for any information that is shared between the players, if I as a player need to see information about another player, that's something that should be put on the player state. Every client will have all of the other clients' replicated information done through the player state. That might very much like the player controller, this information persists beyond porn. So if you think about it, whereas the porn might have something like health, something like that player's score or the last location that player spawned at or their combo bonus or something like that, any information that is kind of like abstracted from the porn specifically, but other clients would need to see, that's going to be on your player state. Obviously, it's replicated, so therefore it supports all your typical RPCs. And very much like the game state, your player state is specified by your game mode. So if we can just see, you can see you specify in your game mode which player state class to use for this level or for your game in general. So in our last presentation, we talked a little bit about the flow that an actor goes through as it gets spawned in and we saw that that's different depending on if you're playing an editor, if that actor has been spawned in when the level was created or when you spawned it in at runtime. It's somewhat similar for the engine and that's because obviously there's two ways we can come into the engine. We can come into it through the editor and we can come into it through a standalone game that we've packaged. For the most part, these are relatively similar, but there's a few key things to kind of bear in mind. Firstly, when we're in editor, our engine has started at the point we started our editor. So there's this kind of period of time before we hit our play in editor button where the engine will kind of exist, but we don't yet have a game instance. On the other side, when we've made a packaged game, our game instance actually exists before our engine gets started. That's kind of a key discrepancy. There's also some slightly different functions are called. We have initialize PIE when we're calling the play in editor, whereas when we're doing a packaged game, we get game instance initialize standalone. But ultimately it all funnels together into this ward begin play. Again, just worth explaining here that this kind of really highlights the fundamental nature of the game instance, that this is really created right at the beginning of the engine, right when our XE first starts up. So before anything to do with the world exists as a concept, we already have our game instance. Next once we're actually within a world, that's where our world itself begins play. And then one of the first things we'll do is create our game mode. And from there on, we have the game mode flow. So game mode start play and then our game mode start match. It's only after that that we begin to spawn other actors and begin the game. So this really demonstrates the primacy of the game mode as a really fundamental gameplay class. You can trust that the game mode is going to have its start behavior, its start logic, and therefore its begin play called before any of the classes. So even at a purely blueprint level where you might not be getting into really fundamentals of all the engine flow, you can kind of trust that if you want to inject some logic that you can trust is going to be called before player controllers, before pawns get spawned or anything like this, put that within the game mode because that's going to be one of the first things that come within your runtime level.",
