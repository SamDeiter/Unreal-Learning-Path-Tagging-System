  "text": " So now that we've gone over the framework and we're closing out this tutorial, I thought it might be a nice little trick to show you how to open multiple of these doors and how to kind of force them open, should we say, through blueprint communication. So the first thing I want to show you is how to create multiple doors that can access. So we can only reference one door at the moment, which is this door. What if I want to reference three different doors? So let's go ahead and do that first. So I want to go into my button blueprint. I want to get the door reference. I'm actually going to delete this door. So I'm going to delete the door reference here. I'm going to compile and save. Don't worry about that. We can delete that as well, but yeah, we're just going to disconnect this stuff. So let's compile, save. On our door reference, you'll see that we've got the blueprint here, the variable, and on the variable drop down, you'll see single or array. So single means we're speaking to a single door. Array means we can speak to an array of doors. So let's click that. Let's compile. Let's save. Let's drag this content to the side. Let's get this variable by CTRL, left mouse drag. We want to drag off here and we want to type 4. So we want to select the first option here for each loop. Again, this is a little bit more of an advanced concept, but I think it's worthwhile digging into this and showing you exactly what can happen here. So we want to press for each loop and we have an array element here. So every door that it finds in this list, it will send out a message for each of these doors. So again, we want to resolve exactly like we did last time and we want to drag into the target and we want to set it. So if I keep this door unlocked variable, you should see this. Depending on the number of doors, you'll see this print out. So let's see. Let's compile. Let's save. Let's go into our first person map. Now you'll see we've got no array elements. Let's add 3. Let's say this door. Let's say this door. Let's say this door. Now what you'll see is if we file, let's just save. You should see the door unlocked print out three times. So let's say door unlocked three times. So therefore we've just unlocked three different doors. So if I go and press control at each one of these doors, you'll see them open and the default property was is locked. So that's just a really, really powerful way of creating blueprint communication for multiple multiple actors. Hope you've got a lot from this tutorial series. We've covered a lot of ground, but hopefully it was broken down in steps so that it allows you, provides you with more confidence to move into slightly more complex blueprint scripting. And even if you only understand the communication between a button and a door and basic blueprint communication, it will really give you a good foundation of continuing your journey in Unreal Engine.",
