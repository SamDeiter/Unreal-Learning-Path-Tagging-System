00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's go ahead and recap some of the things that we talked about.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One, we talked about profiling concepts, types of rendering, concepts and thread profiling.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We looked at calling concepts, calling methods, GPU visualizer, GPU draw thread, CPU draw thread,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
analyzing those draw calls and looking at Unreal Insights.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
From there we looked at optimization visualizers, using those visualizers, quicknotes,

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
lumen, nanite, and even some pro tips with those.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We also looked at nanite and virtual shadow maps, why to use them in an overview of what they do.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We then looked at reviewing understanding LODs.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And in that we looked at how to edit your polygons using the poly editing tools, swapping out geo, merging, and even HLODs.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And from there we finally looked at texture and material optimization, looking at how to optimize your textures,

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the tools we have, as well as materials.

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Overall, I hope you've enjoyed this course and found it very interesting and helpful.

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
