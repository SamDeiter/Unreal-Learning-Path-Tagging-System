1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at optimization visualizers.

2
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.600
So let's get started.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
So using the visualizers can help you analyze your scene and

4
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.759
kind of see what's going on under the hood.

5
00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.320
Now the optimization view modes you'll see here as the pull down here under lit,

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
and you'll see optimization view modes.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.199
There's a lot of these that have to reference not all of it,

8
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.320
but some of it has to reference when it comes to old school baking.

9
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.359
And that in particular is such things as stationary light overlap.

10
00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.320
When it comes to aluminum, you don't really have to worry about that.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.759
And light map density is a bit more on the baking side also.

12
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.920
But you do want to look at your light complexity.

13
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.159
You do want to look at your shader complexity and quads too.

14
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.879
Because that's very important to see how dense your geometry is and

15
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.920
how complex your shaders are, which may be giving you a bit of a slow down when

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.679
it comes to your scene.

17
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:54.480
Now I'll walk you through a little bit of these.

18
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.279
This is a bit of review if you've taken the lighting courses.

19
00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:00.519
But I'm definitely going to point out some things you do need to consider.

20
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.519
So you'll see that there's light complexity for debugging dynamic light overlap.

21
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.840
There is light map density, which we'll talk briefly about that if you are using

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.879
the baking route.

23
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:12.079
I do recommend you try to find your home or

24
00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.840
try to find your workflows a little bit more towards aluminum.

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.159
The baking is great, but there are some limitations for realism.

26
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.280
But on the flip side on aluminum, there are moments where noise is still persistent.

27
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.000
And it is evolving and getting better, stronger, faster.

28
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.680
So let's go ahead and jump into Unreal.

29
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.920
And again, you'll have stationary overlap, shader complexity and

30
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
shader complexity quads and quad overdraw.

31
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.320
I'm going to look at these with you and

32
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.400
point out things to be considered when it comes to baking versus just using Lumen.

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.079
So let's go and do that.

34
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.359
So in our scene here, we have lit and

35
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.040
then we have our optimization view modes.

36
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.600
We can look first up at our light complexity.

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.200
Now again, this leans a little bit more towards baking because pretty much when

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
you're in Lumen, all your lights are movable.

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.280
If I click on this light here, I want to make sure that it is movable in my scene.

40
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.840
This will allow me in my scene to be able to actually adjust my lighting on the fly.

41
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.680
And things will react wonderfully.

42
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.080
This is great for ICV effects and visual effects when it comes to virtual production.

43
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200
Because you can actually get some updates on the fly and

44
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
show it to your directors and so forth.

45
00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.519
And also pretty handy when it comes to games because then you don't have to worry

46
00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.159
about baking out everything.

47
00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.359
So just keep that in mind.

48
00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.000
So that one's kind of a little bit more, you know your lights are complex because

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.959
you know they're all movable, which is the highest one to work with.

50
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.839
And the mesh distance field is on, so it's going to be a bit high already.

51
00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.399
And again, light map density also has to do with baking.

52
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.799
So we still have kept it in there because we still have studios that choose to use

53
00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.919
that for the case that maybe they have a lot of complicated materials.

54
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.079
And there seems to be a lot of noise coming through.

55
00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.000
They actually want to be able to bake still because Lumen still has a little

56
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.759
bit of issue with that because when it comes to your, when it comes to like

57
00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.719
things with high rough and so forth, it's borrowing some of the technology from

58
00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.799
ray tracing, but there will be areas, maybe some shadow areas that maybe get a little

59
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.479
bit of noise and you can adjust those.

60
00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.439
And we talk a bit about that in our foundation intro to lighting class.

61
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.639
We talk about Lumen.

62
00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.599
So this is the light map density.

63
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.280
Now note itself, you'll notice it will pop up here.

64
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.639
You'll notice that there's a higher resolution on the ground versus the wall.

65
00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.799
Now, if you were to use baking, I'm going to let you know you need to make sure that

66
00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.079
both of these are close in ballpark when it comes to your resolution.

67
00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.079
Now these are pretty different when it comes to Lumen and that's okay because

68
00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:40.759
we're not baking.

69
00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.120
We're using Lumen on the fly.

70
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.240
It's giving us our updated shadows and using virtual shadow maps versus light

71
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.680
making information.

72
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.560
But if we were baking, we would want this to maybe be a little bit higher or the

73
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.159
ground to be a little bit lesser.

74
00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.320
And that what that prevents is you may get some blobby shadows if you don't.

75
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.240
So in our case, we're doing just fine because we're using Lumen, but

76
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.680
just note to self if you were to use baking, that may be an issue.

77
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.160
So just be careful of that.

78
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.480
Also, we have stationary light overlap here.

79
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.480
This will tell you if any stationary lights are near, we have none because

80
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.199
everything's movable, so it doesn't apply to us.

81
00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.639
In our particular case, there's shader complexity.

82
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.800
Now this one's always important to analyze because we can see that our land is

83
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
very complex.

84
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.120
Is it in the danger zone?

85
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.519
It's kind of in the medium, just something to keep in mind that that is complex.

86
00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:42.079
So, but you'll see the terrain and the plant and even our alien probe here.

87
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.680
All these are at a relatively decent usability.

88
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.560
They're not going to burden us too much.

89
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.359
So we have shader complexity in quads.

90
00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:56.120
This will tell you what your shader complexity is plus if there's high levels

91
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.159
of geometry.

92
00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.719
We'll see that these orbs are pretty dense.

93
00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.159
So the ones in the back room can be less.

94
00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.399
Some of the looks one right here, he looks pretty, pretty thick.

95
00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.159
So we definitely can optimize that.

96
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.080
So this scene is available for you to play with as we talk about some of these tools.

97
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.320
And we'll talk about geometry when it comes to merging and how you can actually make

98
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.960
these a bit lighter and make it so that they still sell and fool the audience.

99
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.600
And that's kind of what's important.

100
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.280
You want to smoke and mirrors people even in games and film.

101
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.040
You want people to believe that your scene is doing what it's intended and none is the

102
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.560
wiser that you're actually fooling the audience.

103
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.200
So we'll talk about that later.

104
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.039
We have quad overdraw overall tells you where the dense meshes are at in here.

105
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.279
And there's a good amount on these orbs, but you'll notice the ones up above are a lot cleaner.

106
00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.480
These I merged and made a lower levels of detail.

107
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.519
Now see it's a proxy and that actually is better.

108
00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.240
And no one new knows that until I pointed out.

109
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.839
Cool.

110
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.079
All right.

111
00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.919
So there's a few other things here you see texture streaming accuracy.

112
00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.480
You can check for these primitive distance mesh UV density, material,

113
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.360
texture scales.

114
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.759
You can actually use these tools also to check for your even also your virtual

115
00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.200
texture pending MIPS.

116
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.319
We don't go over to this too much in this particular class, but these are also things

117
00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.319
you can use for streaming accuracy.

118
00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.160
We will talk about getting virtual textures up and running here in just a bit.

119
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.920
But again, these can also be used to check a few things.

120
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.720
But for the most part, I'm going to show you that workflow working with virtual

121
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.200
texturing and things to look out for them.

122
00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.159
So I'm going to go to lit mode here.

123
00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.920
Cool.

124
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.800
So let's go ahead and get back to the slides.

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.399
So quad overdraw best practices.

126
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:46.199
Use the quad overdraw viewport mode to profile the scene.

127
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.919
Any green or worse should be avoided to keep costs low.

128
00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:53.919
So blue is ideal.

129
00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.399
So if you get like this really dense green, that's not so great or is this solid?

130
00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.560
That's what made my worse.

131
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.519
You know that it's a really dense geometry and you probably could lower it.

132
00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.959
Now, again, this depends on the output.

133
00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:08.959
Where are you going?

134
00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.560
Are you working in games or you're working in film?

135
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.040
If you're working in film and it's just virtual production, you want some final

136
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.639
pixel work done, you may not have to worry about that.

137
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.399
But if you're going to the LED volume wall, you want to go ahead and think about

138
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.079
how you're going to maintain that because you want to make sure that you don't

139
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:29.079
have too heavy of geometry as your cameras moving around because you have to take

140
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:33.079
an account to draw calls not only on the geometry, but also on your material.

141
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:40.599
If a mount only fills 100 PX by 100 PX on an LED wall, then that mountain doesn't

142
00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:43.800
need to consist of 2 million triangles.

143
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.799
You can even have a facade.

144
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.360
You can have it so that's on a card if you needed to.

145
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.759
The same optimization practices apply for textures.

146
00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.959
The GPU might not load an 8K texture until it's in the camera's direct view.

147
00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.839
So you have to determine where that direct view is.

148
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:05.439
And if you do need a full piece of geometry, you may even have hollowed out geometry,

149
00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.839
a card which is bent, but there's an alpha on top of it.

150
00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:11.439
We used to use that trick all the time for plants.

151
00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:17.240
Just bend that card, have some vertices and edges to be able to manipulate it.

152
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.639
So now the plant looks like it's more robust than it actually is.

153
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:25.639
It's just bending a card and adding more systems to it or more divisions to it.

154
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:34.639
Best practices avoid too much translucency, especially large translucent areas and overlapping translucency.

155
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.639
So just be careful with that.

156
00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:42.639
Use masked materials instead of translucent when possible due to the lower performance

157
00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:47.639
cost and avoid dense meshes built for your screen size.

158
00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:51.639
So again, like I said before, build to your shot.

159
00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.639
So quick notes.

160
00:08:54.639 --> 00:09:00.639
Buffer overview can give you a quick visual rundown of the different G buffers being rendered.

161
00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:03.639
Let's go and take a look at that really quick in Unreal.

162
00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:10.639
All right, so if we go to lit again and I go into here and look at buffer visualization,

163
00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.639
you can look at the overview.

164
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:17.639
And this kind of gives us an overall view of our scene showing our subsurface colors,

165
00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:26.639
specular base, world normal, separate translucency, RGB, what does our opacity look like?

166
00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.639
What does our shading model looks like?

167
00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.639
Metallic.

168
00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:34.639
And it's really nice to get a quick rundown of everything in your scene.

169
00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:40.639
Since we're in Lumen, let's take a brief look at Lumen visualizers, nanite and virtual shadow maps.

170
00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:43.639
Now we've did this for some of our foundational classes.

171
00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:50.639
When it comes to lighting, introduction to lighting, and we jump into that in some of our other lighting classes going forward.

172
00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.639
But I'm going to walk you through a little bit of this so you can understand how this actually works.

173
00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:58.639
So in our scene, let's go back to Unreal.

174
00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:03.639
We're going to go ahead and go to lit and we're going to go to nanite visualization.

175
00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:08.639
Now if I do an overview, you'll notice we don't have anything to look at.

176
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:10.639
But let's go and turn that off for a second.

177
00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:19.639
And let's actually convert some of these to nanite because nanite works really well when it comes to using Lumen and virtual shadow maps.

178
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.639
So making things nanite is not a bad idea.

179
00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:24.639
We have a piece of geometry up front here.

180
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.639
Let's actually find where he's at.

181
00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:32.639
And let's actually right click on this particular piece of geometry and go to nanite and turn that on.

182
00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:38.639
So when we turn that on, we can also pick on this guy, find where he's at.

183
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.639
I think it's pretty much the same one.

184
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.639
Yep, it is.

185
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:47.639
So let's go and grab this piece of geometry here and convert that to a nanite object.

186
00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:48.639
Right click.

187
00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.639
And it's really that easy to turn on nanite.

188
00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:58.639
Now there's a few hoops and other versions of Unreal, but in this particular version of Unreal, it's pretty straightforward.

189
00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:00.639
Now for some reason you're not sure it's nanite.

190
00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:01.639
You can go back and check it.

191
00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:06.639
It didn't populate the tick box when I clicked on it, but it actually was on.

192
00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.639
So we see that that's on.

193
00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:13.639
So now when we go to our viewer here, we go to lit and we go down to nanite visualize.

194
00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.639
We go to overview.

195
00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.639
It's going to show us the calculations for these as I move around in 3D space.

196
00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:27.639
It's going to show my triangles being calculated and you'll see them flip and flick as I get closer and farther away to them,

197
00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:38.639
which is actually Unreal sort of it and only pulling up the best possible visual fidelity images on that object based on my positioning in 3D space.

198
00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:42.639
So being able to view these ahead of time is really great.

199
00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:48.639
So the overview you can use or you can choose to go in here and say, hey, I want to look at these individually.

200
00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:54.639
You can something I want to emphasize though, when you're working with a scene such as this,

201
00:11:54.639 --> 00:12:03.639
you do want to work with nanite and you do want to work with virtual shadow maps and you do want to work with Lumen.

202
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.639
They're the three musketeers.

203
00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:09.639
We made them so they work really nice together and they're efficient.

204
00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.639
So keep those things in mind.

205
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.639
Working with them are really great.

206
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:21.639
If you don't do that and choose to use LODs with your virtual shadow maps and with your Lumen,

207
00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:23.639
you could get a hit a bit on your performance.

208
00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:39.639
And again, the reason why is Lumen and virtual shadow maps and nanite all work together efficiently to only bring to the camera what the highest visual fidelity based on the position of you in the 3D world.

209
00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:43.639
And it is one of the most efficient ways to tackle things.

210
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.639
Now I want to point something out really quick here.

211
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.639
This is more of a migrate issue.

212
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:55.639
It's a little bit segue, just a tad and then we'll get back into the view modes for like Lumen and so forth.

213
00:12:55.639 --> 00:13:02.639
Now you may have noticed in the earlier shots, like some of my rocks looking a little bit dull and not quite having the texture information.

214
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:07.639
That's really just a transitioning between 5.2 and 5.3 because those had worked before.

215
00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.639
They had made a blended material for me to use.

216
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:17.639
Unfortunately, sometimes when you update in migrate, a object which is merged, you do want to do that.

217
00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:21.639
You do want to double check that because it may not work anymore.

218
00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:25.639
And in that case, you could repull your geometry in and reemerge them.

219
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:30.639
In this particular case, the blend material doesn't quite work with this particular piece of geometry.

220
00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:33.639
So if we find this piece of geometry, we find them here.

221
00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.639
This is the merged piece of rock.

222
00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.639
It's several different things together.

223
00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:40.639
At this point, I can just remove it and just replace it.

224
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.639
So just be aware that that may occur sometimes.

225
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:49.639
That's a little bit of the texture optimization stuff, but I'll emphasize, reemphasize those things with Ron as I talked to you about them.

226
00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:55.639
Because it's something to consider where things can go a little bit south as you go to a new version.

227
00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:59.639
And there's a there's a merged material that may be a little bit more complicated.

228
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:03.639
That becomes a problem when it comes to migrating sometimes.

229
00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.639
You want to keep those materials pretty simple.

230
00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:09.639
And also when you're updating your files, take a look at those and see those things in there.

231
00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:16.639
So let's analyze this real quick here again, using some of those viewers.

232
00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.639
The next one we have here is Lumen.

233
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.639
So we can do an overview of Lumen too.

234
00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:26.639
This is going to show us a few things that will show our geometry normals and those things are being processed by Lumen.

235
00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:31.639
We have reflection and view hardware ray tracing.

236
00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:38.639
And then we have Lumen seen pink missing surface catch coverage, yellow, cold surface catch.

237
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.639
So you'll see any issues that may be occurring.

238
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:46.639
So even though those are being marked and tagged here, we're actually not really having any major problems with them.

239
00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:50.639
But again, Lumen tries to bring those things to your attention.

240
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.639
And let me explain what that means.

241
00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:58.639
So areas that don't have surface catch coverage are colored pink in the surface catch view mode.

242
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:03.639
Now these areas will not bounce light and will appear black in reflections.

243
00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:09.639
Issues like this can be fixed by increasing the number of cards used with Max Lumen mesh cards.

244
00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:11.639
But not always.

245
00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:17.639
So if you do run into more problems with them, it's best to maybe break them down into smaller pieces.

246
00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:19.639
Just be aware of that.

247
00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:23.639
Now again, that's a bit more on the lighting optimization, which we'll get into another class.

248
00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:28.639
But I wanted to point out what that meant.

249
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:33.639
And finally we have here, we can go ahead and look at our virtual shadow maps.

250
00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:35.639
I'll look at our shadow masks in here.

251
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:39.639
We can actually take a look at how things are being digested in our scene.

252
00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.639
If we're going to have any issues.

253
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:49.639
Overall, what you're looking for is just a visual representation for areas that you see that are not doing their job.

254
00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:52.639
You'll notice everything is actually working the way that we want.

255
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:55.639
You'll see the colorization happening as we move around.

256
00:15:55.639 --> 00:16:01.639
That is unreal, making sure that it gives us the best possible shadow quality the closer we get into our scene.

257
00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:06.639
Things in the distance, you'll see they're a bit lighter and we don't have to worry about them as much.

258
00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:12.639
But for the most part, it's really just making sure and it's not giving you clear data.

259
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.639
It's just giving you a visual representation.

260
00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.639
And you have to look at all these kind of with a grain of salt.

261
00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:19.639
You can look at them.

262
00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:21.639
They'll give you a visual representation.

263
00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:30.639
The Lumen one is a bit more easy to read and understand versus some of maybe when it comes to our virtual shadow maps.

264
00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:37.639
It's a little more, it's doing the same thing and the fact that it's showing how it's digesting as we're moving around our scene.

265
00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:39.639
You'll see the color process.

266
00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:41.639
It's basically showing you how it's handling these cards.

267
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:44.639
We're way out past the water at this point.

268
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.639
But it's only drawing what is needed.

269
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:53.639
The white stuff is like the most minimalist and you'll see the blue it's calculating almost on an LED type of level.

270
00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:59.639
We do get into this in more in our lighting class, but I just wanted to point out what's going on when you look at this visualizer.

271
00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:05.639
And again, we will actually review some of this in that optimization workflow.

272
00:17:05.639 --> 00:17:07.639
Again, we'll go back into virtual shadow maps here.

273
00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:09.639
We'll look at our virtual page here.

274
00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:13.639
And this again shows you as it's calling upon them as needed.

275
00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:25.639
You can think of this as almost like a nanite type of workflow where it's only pulling up and sorting these on a page by page almost like card information on how it's sorting and doing the data for the shadows.

276
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.640
It just shows you in real time how it's shuffling through things.

277
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:37.640
And then finally we have catch page here and it's kind of again the same type of idea.

278
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.640
All right.

279
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.640
Another pro tip you can see here is you can actually use a tool called show advanced mesh edges.

280
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.640
This will actually show or put an overlay of a wire mesh over all of your geometry.

281
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
It's actually pretty convenient, pretty nice.

282
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.640
Let me show you how to get there in Unreal and how to use it.

283
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.640
So you want to click on under show, go to advanced and you'll see mesh edges right here.

284
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:10.640
That's actually pretty cool and puts it on these objects, but you'll notice it's not putting on the nanite objects.

285
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.640
I just wanted to make that point.

286
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.640
The non-nanite objects, we don't have it set right now to recognize them.

287
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.640
Nanite objects we don't have it set to recognize them, but the non-nanite is actually putting the mesh over that.

288
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.640
So just letting you know it's actually kind of nice as you're in the middle of building.

289
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.640
But as soon as you convert things to nanite, it's going to not show up to the party, but it is kind of a cool tool.

290
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.640
So I just want to show you that real quick.

291
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.640
So overall, let's go back to same...let's turn that off real quick.

292
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.640
Let's go back to our show.

293
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.640
We'll go to our advanced and then turn off that mesh edges.

294
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.640
So again, things to consider when working with your visualizers and overall your scenes.

295
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.640
Again, like I said, and I say this over and over again, and I will say this continually,

296
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.640
because we've had clients run into problems where they're using LODs, they're using Lumen, and they're using virtual shadow maps.

297
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.640
And that becomes a very big performance hit specifically with games as well as virtual production, depending on the scale of your scene.

298
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:19.640
So try to keep things kind of in the three musketeers vein where you're working with Lumen.

299
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.640
You're working with virtual shadow maps and you're working with nanite.

300
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.640
That is the best approach for that.

301
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.640
So again, I want to emphasize that as you're working.

302
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.640
Now we'll talk about in the next few videos, we'll talk about how to merge geometry,

303
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:40.640
manage that, and I'll show you how you can actually merge even nanite and make things a bit more acceptable and smoother when you're working.

304
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.640
Right now we're working at a really nice cool 69 frames per second, so we're doing pretty great.

305
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.640
But again, as things start to increase in a popular scene, you have to consider those things.

306
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.640
That's it with this one.

307
00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.640
Here's a link giving you some more a deeper dive into what we talked about.

308
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:07.640
In the next video, we're going to take a look at nanite up close and we're going to look at virtual shadow maps and managing those overall.

309
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.640
Thank you.
