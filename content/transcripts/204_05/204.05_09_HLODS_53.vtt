00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at HLODs and how they work with your levels

2
00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.759
of detail.

3
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.160
So, let's get started.

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.160
So, HLODs, you may ask, what exactly are they?

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Well, they're a hierarchical level of detail.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.480
It's a way to combine pre-existing SeticMesh actors into a single HLOD proxy mesh and

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.800
material with at-list textures.

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.440
So, using HLOD may lead to increased performances as they reduce draw calls down to one call

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.640
per proxy mesh, which is pretty convenient.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.000
When generating HLOD proxy meshes, there are several parameters you can adjust which help

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.560
define how static mesh actors are grouped together as clusters that will ultimately

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280
be built into proxy meshes.

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
Now, you don't have to use this tool, but it is available.

14
00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.739
It's a little bit more on the old-school side, and you may find that Nenite fits the

15
00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279
bill just fine.

16
00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.179
But to be able to create it, you do want to start out by going into your proxy meshes.

17
00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.840
You can find them under your world settings.

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.519
So these proxy meshes are created from clusters of static meshes, like we mentioned.

19
00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:15.039
Each cluster is going to be one draw call.

20
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.400
That's the benefit you get from this.

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.600
Clusters can't be merged into bigger clusters at a greater distance.

22
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600
So use them for wide shots or open worlds.

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.760
No, HLOD layers can now be used to house Geo also with World Partition.

24
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.040
So you can use them with World Partition also.

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.760
But I want to put a note here for World Partition.

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.939
If you decide to use it with your team, keep in mind there are still some things evolving

27
00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.580
with it, such as linking your World Partition updates with Perforce.

28
00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.260
There can be some workarounds that you may have to tackle in that.

29
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.859
And we're not going to cover that here, but I want you to be aware of it.

30
00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.659
So creating it, we're going to go to our world settings and load Hiercal LOD setup.

31
00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.739
We're going to generate a single cluster if needed.

32
00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.419
And this can be set to HLOD in the HLOD Outletter also, which we'll take a look at in just a

33
00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.419
bit.

34
00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:20.099
So let's hop into Unreal and take a quick look too.

35
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.659
From there, you want to open your Hiercal LOD Outletter and select the HLOD setup asset.

36
00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.419
And that can be default.

37
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.979
So you don't necessarily have to do any heavy lifting on this particular case.

38
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.899
We did have an older version if you were used to it, where HLOD would list a lot more options

39
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.019
than it does now.

40
00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.099
It's been pared down quite a bit.

41
00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.979
But you want to generate your clusters.

42
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.460
And when you generate your clusters, you're going to be able to get the items that you

43
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.699
need.

44
00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:54.740
Now if the actor's changing anyway, it's going to prompt you.

45
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.939
It'll tell you, hey, man, you need to generate those proxy meshes again.

46
00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.299
Because that's kind of important.

47
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.299
Things have changed to update the HLOD cluster.

48
00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.659
Only use build all if you have to.

49
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.019
As it can dirty your scene, and Unreal will let you know.

50
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.540
I'll say, hey, buddy, are you sure about this?

51
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020
This may not be the right choice for you.

52
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.140
We're going to actually look at an HLOD volume also in place with an HLOD in my scene that

53
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.939
I've given to you.

54
00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.540
Let's go ahead and jump into Unreal and look at the setup I have, as well as look at the

55
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.540
HLOD Outliner breakdown that shows some of the things that have been generated and some

56
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.100
overall sweeping control that you've gotten in your scene.

57
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.659
In Unreal, I'm going to go to my beach HLOD sample.

58
00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.139
Let's go and click on that.

59
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.099
I'm going to say, don't save what we were doing.

60
00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.859
Get that to come up.

61
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.139
We'll see it generate, get in there.

62
00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.099
Now, let's go and take a look at things overall.

63
00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.939
Let's open up our HLOD Outliner.

64
00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.419
Let me pull it over.

65
00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.339
You see that I have generated some HLOD objects in here.

66
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.219
We have a LOD actor here that has all the parts for that particular probe.

67
00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.379
We have another one in here.

68
00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:23.899
Unreal's clustering these, so let me know what has become an HLOD object.

69
00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.300
Anytime you don't want these in here, you can delete that cluster.

70
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.019
You're like, hey, I don't really need this one.

71
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.019
This one's fine.

72
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:32.779
Nanite's handling it just fine.

73
00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.180
I can go ahead and delete that.

74
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.939
You can also, as we go and open these up, look at these on an individual level.

75
00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:45.019
You'll see there's advanced settings here, and it just shows you the transform options.

76
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:49.220
It isn't as robust as it used to be, or we used to have a bit more, or you have a little

77
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.860
bit more material control and a few other things.

78
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.019
Those don't quite pop up like they used to.

79
00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.980
Things have been pretty pared down here.

80
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.460
You'll notice at the bottom here, we have a yellow message here.

81
00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:06.459
These actors represented in the HLOD have changed, generate proxy meshes to update.

82
00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:10.099
Since I've tweaked with this file a bit, I would have to just generate another proxy

83
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.339
meshes here for any updates or changes that I've made.

84
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.339
Keep that in mind.

85
00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.139
Again, build all.

86
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.699
You kind of want to avoid if you don't really have to do it.

87
00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:28.099
There's also regenerates your clusters, but no proxy meshes for meshes in the level.

88
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.700
This is your initial button that you would click, and then from there, any changes you

89
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.500
can do for your generated proxy meshes are found here.

90
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:44.740
Now, another thing I want to point out, there's a thing called an HLOD volume.

91
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.240
Type in volume here.

92
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.400
There's a lot here.

93
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.100
You'll see that I've drug in an HLOD proxy volume.

94
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.500
This actually acts as a container to hold a cluster of HLODs that we have built in.

95
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.300
I can actually use this as a priority area until Unreal to read a group of pieces of

96
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.060
geometry as one draw call.

97
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.700
You'll see this HLOD volume here.

98
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.939
This actually works pretty well.

99
00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.460
This HLOD volume, you'll see, also has a few more options.

100
00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.539
It tells you to include overlapping actors.

101
00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.779
I can definitely tick that box on.

102
00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:28.739
There are a few that are overlapping a bit in my scene.

103
00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:35.099
We have a few generic brush settings in here, but we also have include actor in HLOD.

104
00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.819
It's going to, you want to make sure that's turned on.

105
00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.620
There's some advance with the brush settings, but it's nothing to write home about.

106
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.339
But overall, you can see how things work.

107
00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.459
Now, down below, you will see a level instancing.

108
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:49.899
We're not doing that in this particular case.

109
00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:54.779
Level instancing allows you to grab maybe a group of rocks, these particular ones.

110
00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.659
If I wanted to, I can turn them into a level instance actor.

111
00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.819
In this case, we're not covering that in this particular class.

112
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.939
It's a little bit more building of your game world.

113
00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.579
From here, we're mainly going to be focusing on our HLODs.

114
00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:13.779
I just wanted to point that out if you're wondering what that does.

115
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:18.139
This basically allows you to have instanced pieces of large.

116
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.060
You have a huge open world area and there's some rock formations and large landscapes and

117
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.379
just things that you've kind of mushed together.

118
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:31.180
And you have all these pieces of geometry to manage them.

119
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.539
You can actually create a level instance to make things a little bit lighter and unreal

120
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:40.979
will instance those pieces of geometry as an instance part of your level and make things,

121
00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:46.180
it makes things a little bit more organized and categorized and reading the geometry smoother

122
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.740
so that your big world that you've created doesn't become too much of a bog in your scene.

123
00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:01.780
So here, again, we have an HLOD volume and again, it is calculating everything in my scene the way that I want.

124
00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:10.460
And if we did a comparable like we just talked about, I could grab this pieces of geometry here,

125
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.620
right click and you'll see level and I can create an instance level if I wanted to.

126
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.660
And in there, I can have living an HLOD if I wanted.

127
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:23.259
And then it would simply be able to be loaded in here.

128
00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:26.379
Now there's a difference when you're working with those.

129
00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.459
We're working in our levels here.

130
00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:33.980
If I was working in a world partition, I would not be working in levels.

131
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.100
So there's a give and take situation there.

132
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.980
And we do have a class talking about that in which one of my colleagues really breaks

133
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.779
that down a bit easier for you.

134
00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:46.139
But I just wanted to explain if there's any confusion about how that system works.

135
00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:53.740
So to break it down even further, they are used by the hierarchical level of detail HLOD system

136
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.620
to group actors into a single HLOD cluster.

137
00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.500
So again, like I said before, it puts them in a cluster.

138
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.259
When generating clusters, the Unreal Engine will override its normal generation process

139
00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:09.620
in difference to manually placed volume.

140
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.139
So basically going to look at them as a priority area, like I mentioned before.

141
00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:16.740
That's it with this lesson.

142
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.980
Here's a few links here that allow you to dive in a bit deeper on these topics.

143
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.860
In the next section, we're going to take a look at texture and material optimization.
