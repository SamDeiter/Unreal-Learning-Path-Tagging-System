Hi everyone, my name is Sean Spitzer, Senior Instructor for Epic Games.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.839
Today we're going to be talking about optimization for linear content and profiling in geometry.

3
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.080
Some of the things we'll be talking about is profiling concepts in which we'll look

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.320
at different tools that we have to analyze our scene, as well as optimization visualizers,

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.359
Nanite and virtual shadows, as well as we're going to have a review of understanding LODs

6
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.920
and how they work in your scene outside of Nanite and then we're going to review texture

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.640
material optimization. In the next video, we're going to be taking a look at those profiling

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.439
concepts up close, as well as the outline for the course. So let's get started.
