00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at some of the modeling tools that allow us

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.120
to edit our LODs.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.080
So let's get started.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.200
So the tool we're going to be looking at is the modeling tool editor that is found within

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
the plugins.

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.359
And once you turn it on, Unreal will ask you to reboot.

7
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.640
And we're not going to go through all the aspects of the tool, but we're going to primarily

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.839
look at being able to simplify a model as well as being able to change its pivot so

9
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.679
that you can actually get things in position and get the look that you need.

10
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.480
Once you have it active, you can actually go to it through the pull down menu and select

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.640
modeling.

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.439
You can also access it with shift five.

13
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.640
That'll get you where you need to go.

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.640
So let's go ahead and take a look at these two sections here when it comes to simplifying

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600
and looking at the mesh.

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.179
So in Unreal here, we can go ahead and switch to our modeling.

17
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.859
And in here, you'll see that we have several different topics that we can choose from with

18
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.899
our subcategories in here in there.

19
00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.420
What we're going to mainly focus on is to the transform one and the mesh one.

20
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.219
The transform one's pretty simple.

21
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.739
I can select any model in my scene.

22
00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:19.740
Let me hit the F key and say this model doesn't quite have the pivot I want because I built

23
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.099
it wrong or one of my contractors did.

24
00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:27.059
It ended up being bigger than we needed and we ended up scaling it in an engine.

25
00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:31.500
You can actually change this here with the edit pivot tool.

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.619
This allows me to be able to move it in any area that I need, which is pretty convenient.

27
00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.340
Once we move it into the position that we want and we can choose bottom, top, right, back,

28
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.340
you simply hit accept.

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.699
I'm going to hit cancel for that.

30
00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:47.699
You kind of get it.

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.820
It is way better than the older way that we do things, which was the cumbersome pivot tool here.

32
00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.299
This doesn't quite work as well, but this tool is miles ahead.

33
00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.820
Let's go ahead and look at the mesh tool and what it can do.

34
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.259
So before we get too far ahead, we want to make sure that we check and turn on a few

35
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.980
things in our settings.

36
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.180
Let me go to my project settings and show you what I mean.

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.219
In my project settings, if you're going to be editing the models, you want to make sure

38
00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.939
that you turn these on, specifically if you're working with ray tracing.

39
00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.599
But I like to turn them on anyway if I'm in Lumen because some of the technology for ray

40
00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.900
tracing, mainly to speed things up and leaning on the hardware ray tracing aspect, is there

41
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.180
in place and I just want to make sure there's no hiccups.

42
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.740
So what I'll do is I'll put modeling in here and I'll make sure that I'll turn on enable

43
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.740
ray tracing for a new mesh object as well as enable ray tracing while editing.

44
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.860
This is great to actually turn on as a precautionary measure, especially if you're going from Lumen

45
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.219
back to ray tracing, etc.

46
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.780
And it just covers your bases there just so that things are updating accordingly in our

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.780
environment.

48
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.780
All right, so let's go and take a look at our tools here for the mesh.

49
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.140
I'm going to turn this on here and let's go ahead and take a look at this polygon

50
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.300
object and see what it looks like.

51
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.180
I'm going to click on the magnifying glass with a folder.

52
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.099
Now first thing you want to do is determine whether this thing is Nanite or not.

53
00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.020
The tools will still work if they're not Nanite, but I just wanted to show you say you brought

54
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.340
in a model and you decided it doesn't need to be as high as it's marked.

55
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.699
Maybe you want to just downgrade it a little bit because it's way in the background.

56
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.699
There's no need to use it.

57
00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.939
Nanite's pretty clean, so you don't necessarily have to worry about that.

58
00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.259
But you may want to say there's a really high level of detail scan and you're noticing,

59
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.859
man, I don't really need it to be that detailed.

60
00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.619
I just need to sell a web.

61
00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:54.659
You can actually go in here and simplify that mesh.

62
00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.620
You can also float over each model and get an idea what the polygons look like.

63
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.459
This will also tell you whether it's Nanite enabled.

64
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.900
You can see here on this particular one, we have Nanite off.

65
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.620
On this particular one, Nanite is on.

66
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.580
As you float over, it will tell you that Nanite is true.

67
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.580
It says enabled there.

68
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.100
It will even give you a Nanite vertices and triangles.

69
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.660
Let's pick on this particular one.

70
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.860
This one is not Nanite enabled, as we can see.

71
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.860
Let's activate that tool.

72
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.060
I'm going to click away and we're going to go in here, select this tool.

73
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.780
We're going to go to simplify.

74
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.540
Now there's multiple choices that you can choose from here in simplification.

75
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.500
I'm not going to go through too much buttonology.

76
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.579
I do have this laid out in our lecture notes.

77
00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:49.779
Two of them, which work pretty well, is the normal aware, which allows you and allows

78
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.620
Unreal to honor your normals, take them into account.

79
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100
UE standard, this is the one I typically choose.

80
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.459
This one actually works really, really well.

81
00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.899
We can work through triangle percentage here.

82
00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.819
Again, it ballparks it.

83
00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.699
If you were to choose, say, you want to do exactly triangle count, it's going to also

84
00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.659
estimate it here, just like it would with Maya, Houdini, or 3ds Studio Max.

85
00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.939
It's going to give an approximation.

86
00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.419
I'll keep it percentage for now.

87
00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.419
I think that works pretty well.

88
00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.019
Do we want to drop it 50%?

89
00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:23.019
Why not?

90
00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.139
We'll go ahead and do that.

91
00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.819
Let's go ahead and drop that.

92
00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.579
One thing I want to point out, though, before I get into this, is you want to make sure

93
00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:39.019
you have a copy of your geo in the scene, because if, say, you like the original and

94
00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.779
you want to dumb it down to see what it looks like, keep in mind it's going to dumb down

95
00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:50.539
the polygons on all the instances in your environment, which is not exactly ideal.

96
00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.060
You might want to duplicate it in the content browser.

97
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.420
Let me hit cancel for a second.

98
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.740
Just find that piece of geometry, and you can see I have several duplicates here.

99
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.580
Duplicate them, drag them in the scene, and then run a procedural, I should say, a simplification

100
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.740
on it, and then kind of see how it looks and what you want.

101
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.500
Instead of doing it on one, which may be in several different areas, it may not fit the

102
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.500
bill.

103
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.259
All right.

104
00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:22.980
So let's click on simplification, keep it at percentages, keep it at unreal standard,

105
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.379
and we'll do 50%, and let's go ahead and hit accept.

106
00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:29.379
We'll let it run there.

107
00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:31.540
It's going to be running for us.

108
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.379
There it goes, pretty fast.

109
00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:38.060
Now you can find that piece of geometry, and we can now see that it's been dropped.

110
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:47.420
It was 47, I think 47, almost 53,000 triangles.

111
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.700
Now it's 23, and it actually looks pretty good still.

112
00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.019
Now again, keep in mind it still has the high resolution texture.

113
00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:57.979
You can also dump that down using virtual textures, which we'll talk briefly about later.

114
00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:04.459
But for the most part, we're actually in here, and it worked really, really well.

115
00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:07.779
All right.

116
00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:15.019
So say you have it in your scene, though, and you kind of want to replace maybe another

117
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:17.219
one in your scene.

118
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.700
But you're like, you know what?

119
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.500
I have this guy, and there's several of them I want to replace.

120
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.820
I'm going to hit shift E, and let's see if there's any duplicates.

121
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.820
No, there's not.

122
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.820
We'll just pretend there's is.

123
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.820
So let's go and make some duplicates really quick.

124
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.220
So I go to Alt, there's another one, rotate it just a little bit.

125
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.220
So this is like too generic.

126
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:46.620
Move that back, not too far back, and then we do Alt and move.

127
00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:53.819
So if I have multiples in the scene, I can hit shift E, and it will select them.

128
00:07:53.819 --> 00:08:00.579
With them selected, I can right click, and I can replace that actor with the one that

129
00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:05.379
I've just dumped down, which actually works pretty well.

130
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:08.500
Now if you're not sure, you can go in here and just float over this guy.

131
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.500
You'll see he is variant three.

132
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.100
You'll see that the one that we dumped down, he is variant one.

133
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:24.500
So if I click on this, shift E, now right click, replace actors with variant one.

134
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500
There you go.

135
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.500
Not too bad.

136
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.259
And now we have replaced that existing one, which was higher poly, to a lower poly model.

137
00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:40.620
And this can come in pretty handy, especially if you really just want simplification in

138
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.620
your scene.

139
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.139
Nanite works great, Lumen works great, virtual shadow maps work great, but if you throw the

140
00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:49.980
kitchen sink at it, you can bring anything to a crawl.

141
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.940
So optimizing things where you need them, you can actually lower polygons, keep it in the

142
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.299
background if you need it, and it works really great.

143
00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:03.179
So just another option if you need to edit things in here, you don't necessarily have

144
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.259
to go back to your DCC.

145
00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:08.299
So looking at the settings again.

146
00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:15.779
We have a simplifier type here, all the different ones, QEM, normal aware and UE5 standard.

147
00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:21.139
This is the one I typically use, edge claps, and minimal polygon group, preserving your

148
00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:23.059
polygon groups there.

149
00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:26.379
And then we also have target mode, which just controls your percentage of decimation.

150
00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:30.379
And do you want to try goals like I mentioned, polygons or disease and et cetera.

151
00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:31.979
That's really up to you.

152
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:35.939
Once done, it updates the triangle count in the content folder.

153
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:43.260
Similar to many DCCs, the changes approximated like I mentioned before, so keep that in mind.

154
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:49.580
So we talked about replacing it, hitting shift E, and then also just right clicking and getting

155
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.860
that quick change in your scene.

156
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.540
So I don't want to point this out at the bottom here.

157
00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.860
No, with modeling tools, modeling tools, you can increase polygons if the LOD that came

158
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.980
in is too low res.

159
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.460
So you can remesh it.

160
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.620
Now you can also do that for an object that's come in as an ad-ite, and you want it to be

161
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.420
maybe a little bit heavier.

162
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.500
Now now that it's pretty great in the fact that it honors what you got from Megascans

163
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.300
or maybe something that you scanned on your own, you can bring that in as an ad-ite mesh

164
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.180
and it will get it at its highest level of detail.

165
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.940
So you may or may not have to remesh.

166
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.220
So this is really up to you and it's a case by case.

167
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:38.100
This is a bit talking a little bit more towards LOD work and pretty much Nanite is its own

168
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:46.340
type of LOD on a triangle basis versus on geometry swapping out the pieces.

169
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.860
So in the next video, we're going to start talking about merging geo and how that works.

170
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.180
Thanks again.
