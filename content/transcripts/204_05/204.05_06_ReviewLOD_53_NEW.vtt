00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
In this video, we're going to be talking about a review for understanding LEDs and how they

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.240
work.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.960
Now, let there be a note here that working with LEDs, you primarily want to work with

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.919
them when it comes to baking.

5
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.199
You can use them with lumen, but you do run the risk, especially if you're mixing it with

6
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.920
Nettite, of hitting some performance costs.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.320
And you kind of want to avoid that.

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.199
Let's go ahead and take a look a little bit at understanding how they work.

9
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.640
And I will be bringing in some caveats here to remind you that, well, as cool as LEDs

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.159
are, they are primarily being used and should be used when it comes to baking scenarios.

11
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.480
So the workflow with it, you always want to choose your LEDs wisely.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.960
If I was baking, say GPU baking, and my ICVFX environment required it, and maybe my game

13
00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.320
workflow that my, maybe we're porting stuff off out to the iPad or the phone, and we chose

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.159
not to use lumen, just be able to control things a little bit better.

15
00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.240
I can choose whether I want low quality in Quixel, high quality, and if I was in lumen

16
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.920
to use Nettite.

17
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.040
So all these things need to be determined exactly what you need ahead of time.

18
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.620
It's a bit different when it comes to ICVFX.

19
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.020
You have to actually determine in your stage, what is the priority areas or the hero object

20
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.500
areas and how high those resolutions are going to be based on distance from the camera.

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.380
Now I know that changes from week to week and from shot to shot working with the director.

22
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.740
So just keep those things in mind.

23
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.140
You may want to grab a good amount of nanites if you needed based on your decisions, but

24
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.140
not too much.

25
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.939
You don't want to bloat your scene.

26
00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.459
You don't want to bring things to a crawl, but you'll at least have the option to import

27
00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.420
them if you needed to bring them into your scene.

28
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.140
So just keep in mind, you need to be very deterministic.

29
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.780
And I would recommend on being very strategic on where you place things and try to determine

30
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.659
ahead of time what the goals are and visually what you want to go for.

31
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.419
And again, this does change and you can import these later on too.

32
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.020
Now if you're using LODs, you can actually generate your LODs after the fact.

33
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.860
And that's actually pretty helpful.

34
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.100
So if you bring it in and you determine that you need a few more to represent objects in

35
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.100
the distance, you can totally do that in a baking scenario.

36
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.620
All right, let's go to the next slide.

37
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.020
And in here, let's go and talk about a bit of controlling your LODs.

38
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.180
Now again, this is a bit of a review from some of the other classes, which talk about

39
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180
working with LODs.

40
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.780
But I'm going to dive a little slightly deeper in the fact that I'm going to point out some

41
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.699
things that you can do and you can control for your environment.

42
00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.620
So let's go and hop into Unreal and take a look at a few things.

43
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.460
So here in Unreal, I'm kind of breaking the norm here.

44
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.340
I have several different versions of types of geometry here.

45
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.139
I have one that is LOD, another one is Nenite.

46
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.819
Again, that's not typical and you do need to be prepared and watch out for any performance

47
00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.819
hits.

48
00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.500
But I'm basically for lecture purposes, I have two different kinds.

49
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.900
So this one out here in the distance, let's actually look at the magnifying glass here

50
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.379
with a folder.

51
00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.180
And we'll see that we have one that is Nenite.

52
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180
That's this particular one.

53
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.180
And one that is not.

54
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.379
And automatically, you'll know exactly which one is which, simply by clicking and seeing

55
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.539
which one is active.

56
00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.340
So this one's using LODs.

57
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.060
Let's double click on this one and take a closer look.

58
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.259
Now again, when working with LODs, you want to work with it primarily with a baking scenario

59
00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:51.340
because it educators to it and you have less of a problem when it comes to generating your

60
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.899
virtual shadow maps and Lumen.

61
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:58.859
And overall, the performance is been made in such a way so that Lumen, virtual shadow

62
00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.259
maps and Nenite all work together smoothly.

63
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.899
So if you do a mixed bag, you could run into some problems.

64
00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:05.899
Just remember that.

65
00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.620
So say we're in a GPU baking scenario here.

66
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.900
So working with this, I have things set to an LOD auto.

67
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.340
Now in here, we have one, two, three, four, five.

68
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.660
We can determine these and choose these in our settings.

69
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.660
So you can see that they're all in here.

70
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.459
And at any time, if I wanted to, I can custom these and isolate the ones that I don't want.

71
00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:32.300
And Unruh will shuffle accordingly to my needs.

72
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.500
So working in here as we scroll down, let's actually close some of the material options

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500
here.

74
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.459
So I can see that we have the LODs we can choose from and edit as we clicked on that

75
00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:43.459
custom.

76
00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:47.459
Allow me to switch materials if I need to, control my triangles.

77
00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:53.500
And because we have auto, custom compute distances, I now have, I can control exactly

78
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.180
what the distance is on things going to be drawn.

79
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.899
And that's actually kind of nice to be able to have that.

80
00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:05.100
You'll see we have triangle control, percentage triangles, max triangle count for each set

81
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.699
of LOD that I have in place.

82
00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.459
The only problem or the thing you should look out for in this particular case when working

83
00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:16.819
with it, and this is mainly for reduction, you need to determine exactly what it is

84
00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.939
your LODs are sitting at.

85
00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.300
And you'll see here the percentage per triangle is set up nicely by default.

86
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.939
If you change these, you need to remember what these numbers are.

87
00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.980
So keep those things in mind if you decide to change those as we go.

88
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.339
As I move my camera out and in, you'll see the LOD zero to LOD one, to LOD two, to LOD

89
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.419
three, all set up pretty nicely.

90
00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.819
And Unreal does a really good job of setting this up in defaults to be able to actually

91
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.219
control what's happening.

92
00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.019
Now, again, you can customize this if you want to or not.

93
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:53.059
As you notice, I close it, all those other options go away.

94
00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.139
So you can control the max.

95
00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.099
You'll notice you can also control it on the lumen front, you can control the max lumen

96
00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.620
cards for that object.

97
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.299
And that actually can be pretty helpful.

98
00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:04.299
That's a quick note.

99
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.020
That's something I'll bring up later on when we get into lumen and lighting optimization.

100
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.180
So you can also control the group.

101
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.980
What this is, it allows Unreal to get a head start.

102
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.740
And what your intentions are, is this a foliage object?

103
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.819
Is it high detail?

104
00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.139
Is it a large prop?

105
00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.540
And Unreal will actually try to adjust things according to that object in 3D space.

106
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.860
So it kind of just gives you a quick heads up.

107
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.019
Now it isn't like a all sweeping, amazing.

108
00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:35.859
It'll get you a great large head start, but it actually helps Unreal calculate and know

109
00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.859
exactly what your intentions are for that object.

110
00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:42.500
Now you can choose the number of LEDs ahead of time too.

111
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.779
We have five.

112
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.339
Once you increase this number, you want to apply your changes and it will be set in there.

113
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:54.339
All these things can be done as well as you loading your own LEDs for import.

114
00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:59.459
So if you need to actually swap them out, you can re-import a new version that you have.

115
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:04.219
It'll actually re-import existing, but you can also choose which ones that you need and

116
00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.099
want.

117
00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.979
So it's nice to be able to do this at any time and even build out your system.

118
00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:17.299
So if I go back to custom here, you'll notice as I bring in custom, we actually have some

119
00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:20.539
of our scenes such as screen size ready to go.

120
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.379
Now you'll notice the screen size is grayed out.

121
00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.219
So this is necessary to be turned on.

122
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.260
To do so, you actually have to turn off your auto compute.

123
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.460
So you'll see auto compute down below.

124
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.140
If I turn this off, you'll notice now that the production or I should say screen size

125
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.300
control is now available.

126
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.740
So I can choose how much percentage on that screen size I'm going to do with these properties.

127
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.700
It's basically an override to say, hey, I want this to show up at a particular time kind

128
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.700
of.

129
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.940
You can think of it that way.

130
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.460
So this is all controllable within here.

131
00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:59.939
We also have the ability to colorize and look at how things are being sorted.

132
00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:04.979
It's probably best that we do this in Unreal outside of the mesh editor.

133
00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:08.620
So let's go ahead and turn that on.

134
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.299
So I'm going to go to my view modes here.

135
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.459
And we're going to go down to our level of detail colorization.

136
00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:16.939
And we're going to go to mesh LED colorization.

137
00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:20.379
You'll again see some that are grayed out because they're already in Nenite.

138
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:24.500
But for the most part, you'll see it pop in and out through the different color levels

139
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.819
of detail.

140
00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:30.300
It's actually pretty cool, but it shows you then that it's working and sorting according

141
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.300
to what you need.

142
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.460
I just can't drive right now.

143
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.779
So if we go forward, you'll actually see it pop in and out and it's sorting through the

144
00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.259
levels of detail.

145
00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:44.580
Again, if you missed where I clicked on it, it's under lit.

146
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.899
And then we have level of detail colorization and you can put that on.

147
00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:50.899
That's it with this one.

148
00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:54.939
In the next video, we're going to be talking about merging geometry and looking at that

149
00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:55.939
up close.

150
00:08:55.939 --> 00:08:56.620
Thanks again.
