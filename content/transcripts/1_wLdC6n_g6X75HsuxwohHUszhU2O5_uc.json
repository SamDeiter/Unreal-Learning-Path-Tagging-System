  "text": " This last section will wrap up the Source Control and Collaboration course with a few more final recommendations, providing some tips and resources for you to use as you work in your collaborative production pipeline. Now starting out, a big one. Changing file folder names, or as we like to call it, breaking perforce. When working with Unreal Engine and Perforce, absolutely avoid renaming whenever possible. Renaming can cause duplication of folders or synchronization disconnect with your data. Similar issues may arise if you disconnect from version control, rename, and then try reconnecting your files to Perforce. Next, we talked about adding files in previous sections of this course. But I want to reiterate, when marking your files or folders for add, make sure that you select the nested subfolders for good measure. This will help Perforce isolate your files and only selecting the parent folder can run the risk of generating fractured data. With that said, Perforce has gotten better at the marking for add function in newer versions. So if you forget to do this, don't worry too much about it. Just try and make a habit of doing it before marking for add and submitting. Now if your data is not syncing, one of the things we recommend is creating a fresh pool of information that should correct this problem. To do that, simply right click on the file or folder in Perforce that is causing you problems. Select the Get Revision option to open the Get Revision pop-up menu. Once open, choose the Force Operation option and click Get Revision. That will force a fresh pool of all selected data, but be aware that this process will take some time to replace all those files. So make sure to take a short coffee break once you start the pool. Now let's talk about Perforce and World Partition. And this first recommendation is to employ data layers when using World Partition. Spotable actors may also be an option when working with data layers that become difficult to manage early on in your production. Keep an eye out for when that happens. It is also highly recommended that you implement one file per actor. And the reason for that is because one file per actor will provide you with a hash code that is searchable in Perforce. That way assets created for World Partition in Unreal Engine can then be searched for in Perforce with that code. Continuing the discussion about Perforce and World Partition, let's focus a little more on one file per actor, which can help ensure a file is checked out when adding it to the World Partition. Do not leave the World Partition checked out for too long, as this may cause problems for other users. Be sure to check in the World Partition when you are finished. Now there are two items that are needed for tracking with one file per actor. As we just mentioned, the package short name, which is the searchable actor hash code for Perforce, and then the revision control icon. As you can see in this image, the revision control displays your asset status. And in this example, that's the question mark, which means that the World Partition asset is not checked in. One thing to note here is that the revision control icon is vital when working on a team. And if it's not active, other users may not see what is checked out. And that can prevent project validations, which is why Epic Games permanently enables this option in production. Now if you do run into validation errors, open up a blank level and run the validation process again. This usually restores the validation due to a dirty save that's being done by Unreal Engine. Doing this by closing the World Partition level is currently the only workaround for this problem. And one final thing to note here, one file per actor is enabled by default within the World Partition, and currently experimental when being used outside of the World Partition. Now this course really covered a lot of material, but don't worry, there's more help out there. The video links here are amazing resources. The first YouTube link is a two-hour livestream covering source control in depth, looking well beyond the initial commits and looking at scaling source control for a project. The next YouTube link is a source control webinar looking at each of the source control options one by one and reviewing some of their technical and usability concerns in greater detail. Of course, we have our own documentation from Epic Games that are specific to using Perforce and source control with Unreal Engine. And if you're looking for a more Perforce-specific document, then Perforce also has a curated page with all their collected Unreal Engine resources. A shout out to Sean Spitzer and Ryan Manning for their support in this course development, and this concludes the Source Control and Collaboration course. I want to thank you for spending your time working through this course material.",
