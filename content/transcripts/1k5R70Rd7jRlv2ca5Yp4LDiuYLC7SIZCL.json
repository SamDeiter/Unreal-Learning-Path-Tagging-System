  "text": " We now have a startup level that we can use to build our project. Let's see how we can create the plaza for starters. In the Content Browser, expand the Meshes folder. It already contains all the assets you need for this project. Mind you, some of these assets have been a bit adjusted after import. Let's see what was improved. Note the To Site folder. It contains the mesh objects for the plaza, but some of the pivot points have been reworked for easier manipulation. We'll take a look at the raw files first and adjust them ourselves. Select the Meshes folder and create a folder underneath named Site Pivots. Next, go to the Sample Finished, Meshes, To Site folder and copy all the assets to the Site Pivots folder that you created. This is done via a simple click and drag and then choosing Copy here from the pop-up menu. Select the newly copied meshes, represented by a light blue bar, and drag them into the scene. You probably need to zoom back a bit to view the newly inserted actors. There are seven of them. With all of them still selected, reset their location to 000. This is done by using the Reset icon next to the Location parameters in the Details panel. Having their pivot points at 000 is helpful for global reset like you just did, but will make individual transforms difficult to manage when trying to move or rotate any given object. We'll get to that in a moment. Also note that currently, the applied materials are based on parent materials. Opening a material opens up the node-based material editor in Unreal. It is better to apply material instances to actors as those are not as expensive to compute as their parent counterpart. Lucky for us, we have a few provided material instances we can use under Materials, Instances. We have a few provided material instances we can use under Materials, Instances. So we can apply the grass, gravel, and paving where needed. We still need to copy the low wall and the stairs to the other side. This is where it becomes hard if the pivot point is located far away from the object. Let's recenter it first, using the modeling tools in Unreal. You will find those under the Modes button on the main toolbar. If the modeling option is not available, you need to manually enable the plugin for it, but this is automatically available when you use an AEC template to start the project, which we did in this case. Make sure the low wall is selected and go to the Transform tab and use Edit-Pivot. Although you can manually move and rotate the pivot point into place, it's easier to use the presets. The bottom option centers the pivot and as the name implies, places it at the bottom of the object, which is fine for our needs. Click Accept to save the changes. Now you can easily duplicate the wall to the other side by Alt-moving it. Now you can easily duplicate the wall to the other side by Alt-moving it. Do the same with the steps. First relocate the pivot point, then duplicate the steps to the other side. Additionally, you can give this duplicate a minus 1 X scale value to mirror the step before placing them next to the wall. Again, we'll do a bit of housekeeping here by creating a folder for the plaza and the outliner, and dragging all these new components inside of that. While this allows you to temporarily hide actors in the editor, this doesn't work when you go into play mode. The plaza would still be visible there. Big lighting would also still account for them, even if the actors are not visible in the viewport. Go into the Levels panel and create a new empty level. Give it a name such as My Plaza. The new level is automatically made current. Any new actor you introduce at this time will be part of this new level. In our case however, we want to make existing actors part of this new level. So go back to the Outliner and select everything related to the plaza. Back to the Levels panel, right-click the My Plaza level and then choose Move selected actors to Level. By default, the sub-level's visibility is activated through Blueprint code, which is why you won't see the plaza if you were to go into play mode. The little blue dot next to the level label indicates that its On-Off status is controlled by Blueprint. But you can change the streaming method from Blueprint to Always Loaded to override that, if you simply want to use streaming levels as a visibility tool. That's about it for now, but if you have time, add a few benches to the scene by dragging them from the Meshes-Bench folder. They will automatically be made part of the My Plaza sub-level, as it is set to Current. However, you need to also add them to the plaza folder in the Outliner. When you're done, make sure you make the Persistent Level Current before moving on. When you're done, make sure you make the Persistent Level Current before moving on. This is done by double-clicking in the Levels panel. At this point, you may consider moving the plaza closer to the center of the world. Use Save All to save your work. Next, you will erect the buildings around the plaza. BE HOW YOU \uc544VE BEEN",
