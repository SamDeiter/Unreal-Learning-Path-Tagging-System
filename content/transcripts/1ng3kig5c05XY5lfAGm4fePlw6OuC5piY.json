  "text": " With all the under the hood stuff out of the way, let's talk about scripting and Blueprint. Blueprint is an extensive suite of tools built on top of a C++ foundation, allowing developers to start creating immediately. It's built directly into the editor, impairing any member of the team, be they design, art or anything in between, to start developing their ideas with a significantly reduced iteration time, making it ideal for testing out ideas, making it great for prototyping. But, well structured Blueprint can and should be considered production code, and mechanics built in Blueprint shouldn't be dismissed because they're not in native C++. Traditional concepts that apply to programming also apply here, as Blueprint is, for all intents and purposes, a fully featured, fully functional and feature rich programming environment and should be treated as such. When developing in Blueprint, it's important to consider factors that you would otherwise consider in regular code. Is this going to kill my frame rate? Is this maths function as efficient as it could be? Have I built my Blueprint in an object orientated manner? With that in mind, where does that leave the traditional engineer when it comes to such a powerful scripting engine? There's a whole spectrum of tools that we can develop as engineers to give our designers and artists, as well as ourselves, more fleshed out tools when working in the raw C++. Ultimately, Blueprint sits on top of the project's code, so we can expose our areas of the code to give the team more gadgets to play with. Exposing a functionality is staggeringly easy when using Unreal's reflection system, specifically the U function and U property specifiers and their associated meta. As an expansion of the U function specifiers, we've got the Blueprint Callable. So imagine we've got a complex set of mathematical functions that really do benefit from being in C++. We can define the complex function in code and have our Blueprint layer call it. The Blueprint Callable with a const keyword, or Blueprint Pure, gives us a single getter node in Blueprint. Typically, most Blueprint nodes need to be executed. Marking a function as const, or indeed having it marked as a Blueprint Pure meta, will give us a node that simply pulls the value without executing anything at all. Blueprint Implementable Event is a function that we can call from code, but execute it on the Blueprint itself. So say we've got some cosmetic functionality that we want to trigger from code, but we don't have access to the required assets or components to manage that effect in the code. It's not a problem. We can create a Blueprint Implementable Event and hook up our cosmetics on the Blueprint graph. A Blueprint Native Event is very similar to a Blueprint Implementable Event, but it also has a Native Implementation. If this function isn't overridden on the Blueprint graph, the Native Implementation will be called instead. Moving on to U property, we have UIMin and UIMax. This provides a slider in editor for the user to enter a float value clamped at the entered values. It does not prevent the user from entering a value outside of the desired bounds, however. For that, we need to look to clampMin and clampMax, which will cause the values entered into a float parameter to be bound with this range. From there, we can look at displayName. This changes what name is displayed besides this parameter in the editor. It's useful for when we want a very descriptive naming code, but maybe a more succinct, contextual one in the editor. From there, we have BlueprintGetter and BlueprintSetter. This allows us to manually define a function to call when directly getting and setting a member variable. It's useful if we want to call another piece of code directly whenever a value changes in Blueprint. As mentioned, Blueprint is a fully featured language and as such supports interfaces. Interfaces can be defined in C++ and implemented in Blueprint with any of its virtual functions free to implement the U function markup. In order to achieve this expansion, though, we must markup our interface with the UInterfaceBlueprintableSpecifier. When calling an interface function on a Blueprint class from native, we first have to check the object that we're working with actually implements this interface at all. Alternatively, you could cast the object to the intended interface. That too would let us know if it implements it. If it does, we can go ahead and call the function using a statically generated execute function following the above syntax. The parameters being the object we wish to call the function on, followed by any parameters that are required for that function signature. Unreal's architecture has an incredible degree of flexibility and helps put power into designers and artists' hands when getting their ideas out and working in the project and to a production level. The idea that Blueprint is for non-programmers or for prototyping is demonstrably incorrect, and the two methods of development, that being traditional engineering and Blueprint, should be seen as working hand-in-hand, not in opposition to each other.
