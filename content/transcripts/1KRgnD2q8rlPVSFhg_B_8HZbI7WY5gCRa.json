  "text": " So what is animation blending? So it's a way of taking multiple animation sources and blending them together with a few different methods to create a new animation or update a pose on a character maybe. So you might blend together two whole animations because you want them both playing at the same time or transitions a blend from one animation to another. Or you can even get more complex and specify on which particular bone you want to blend an animation on, depending on what your use case is. Now this is all done inside the Anim Graph of your animation blueprint and we're going to take a look at a few different nodes that can help you achieve an animation blend in a few different ways. A couple of the nodes that you can use to get some simple blending between two different animations are the Apply Additive and the Blend nodes. Now with each of these nodes you can input multiple animations but you can see that they have slightly different input names. Now the Apply Additive has a base and additive input pins whereas the Blend node has A and B input pins. And this is because they work in slightly different ways so they'll give you slightly different results. Now the Apply Additive will take your base pose and apply the additive pose or animation on top working a bit like an animation layer in something like Maya. So you can achieve like a 50-50 blend between the two animations as you bring the alpha up. So as you go from 0 to 1 it'll bring the strength of the additive animation up applying it on top of that base animation. Whereas with the Blend node you're transitioning between two different animations or two different input poses. So as you control the alpha from 0 to 1 you'll be increasing the strength of that B pose and decreasing the strength of the A pose. So it won't always be a combination of the two as with the Apply Additive. You're transitioning from one animation to the next animation as your alpha increases from 0 to 1. One important thing to note when you're using additive animations is that you want to update the additive settings in the asset details of the animation itself to ensure that the animation will play correctly. Now this will either be in local space or mesh space depending on your use case. Now if you want to get a bit more complex and a bit more specific with some of your animation blending we have what's called function blend nodes and these are categorised by this green heading at the top of the node. Now these are some more advanced nodes that lie to blend animations based on specific parameters in your project. Now some of these like the int, the bool and the enum blend nodes perform a time-based blend between two or more poses. So you can actually blend more than just two animations with these. To add more animation pose inputs you can actually right-click the node and just choose Add Blend Pin. Now looking at the blend poses by Integer node this uses an integer value as the driving force behind the blend. So each animation pose you input is given its own integer value and as your active child index value reaches one of those blend pose values it will trigger that pose and then blend into the animation pose. Now each of these animation poses has their own blend time and that's used to control how long it will take to blend into that pose. The blend poses by bool node uses a boolean, so a true or a false value, as the trigger. So when the bool reads true, the pose connected to the true pin will trigger and when the bool reads false, the pose connected to the false pin will trigger. And again you have the same options here where you can control the blending time into these animation poses. Now blend poses by enum allows you to blend animation poses based on values of an enumerator. So this is the damage state that we have connected to the active enum value. So the example we have here gives us a small damage, medium damage and heavy damage input poses and these values are read directly from the enumerator and populated in your blend poses node. Now this means that it takes all the different levels of damage and different animation poses are going to be blended in based on what values we hit and what damage state we're in. And again you have the same value that you can control the blend time into any of these poses individually. Now if you have a scenario where you only want to blend the animation pose onto a certain chain of bones or a certain part of your character, you can specify that with the layer blend per bone node. So you can set the blend mode to use a blend mask with this and that means you can mask out parts of the body that you don't want the animation to play on or you can set it to use the blend mode to use a branch filter which will allow you to specify bone names and the animation will play on those bones and the children of those bones. So somewhere else that you can also have control over animation blending is within state machines. So inside a state machine you have what's called a transition node and this is created automatically when you create a transition between two states. Now this transition node gives you some options of how to blend from one state to another. So in the blend settings here you have your duration which is just how long it takes to blend into the new state in seconds. You can also change the blend mode which is a set of predefined interpolation curves that define how the weighting of the animations change during the blend. You could also create a custom curve for that and control how the weighting of each animation changes. So you might want to start with maybe a linear curve immediately bringing in that new animation pose and then easing out of it and flattening out that tangent towards the end of the curve so that blends out of it nicely. Thanks for watching!",
