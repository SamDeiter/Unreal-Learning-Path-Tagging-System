  "text": " Continue working on your project or open the level named 7-Render if you missed a step earlier. If you have missed the part about downloading the Marketplace People Pack you need for this part of the class, open the Epic Games Launcher and go to Marketplace. Search for and locate the free Scan3D People Pack and download it. It gets added to your vault. Click the Add to Project button and then locate the project you are working on named AEC Exterior 427. Select it and then click the Add to Project button. It's as simple as that. In a few moments, a folder with all the required assets gets added to your project's Content Browser. Start in the RP00 Animations folder. Drag the girl to a point near the bench under the oak tree and rotate her to face the gravel area. Similarly, drag the Manuel fellow inside the gravel area. Rotate him around as he's about to perform a dance step that will bring him full circle. Go into Play mode to see how the character's animations play out. You can place additional characters into the scene, but this particular pack, being free, is somewhat limited. It does have a couple of post characters that you can use, namely Dennis, or Fabienne and Percy, but those are not animated. Still, not a bad deal for something that costs nothing. Place these characters in their own folder in the Outliner, and create a sub-level for them, like you have learned to do, if only to keep things consistent. Finally, you are just about ready to capture a few still images to disk. First, you want to get rid of any gizmos from the viewport. You can easily do this with the help of the G key. It toggles all of these icons and gaming tools on and off. Adjust the view to a shot that you like, and then you can start the game. You can use the arrow icon in the top left corner of the viewport and choose High Resolution Screen Chat. What's interesting about this tool is that it has a multiplier value. Use this with caution though, because it will crash your system if you're not careful. A multiplier value of 1 captures the screen in its current resolution. In my case, I'm running at 1440p, which is 2560 by 1440. A multiplier value of 2 will double that and I would end up with a still image of 5120 by 2880. A multiplier value of 3 will get me closer to an 8K picture, which is where I draw the line. Beyond that, I wouldn't risk it unless I have a top-end system and it's absolutely necessary. When you're ready, you can take a screenshot, which gets saved to your project's Saved folder, You can of course save as many images as you'd like. As you're improving your knowledge of Unreal, you will learn how to create not only still image outputs, but animation sequences as well. Keep an eye out for more classes and videos on using Sequencer and Cinematics to improve on what you have learned here today.",
