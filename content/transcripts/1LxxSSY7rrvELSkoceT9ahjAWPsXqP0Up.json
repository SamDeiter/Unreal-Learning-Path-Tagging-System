  "text": " In this section, I want to take a moment to dive deeper into the underlying concepts of blueprints. We're going to get a bit more technical here, but it's important to understand what goes behind the scenes. There are different types of blueprints. We have seen the most common one already, the Blueprint class. Other types include data-only blueprints, which are blueprints without an even graph, just attributes. We have animation blueprints too, which command the behavior of a character and its animations. Then libraries of blueprints and also a special type that lets you add custom interfaces to blueprints. Even levels have their own blueprint. Level blueprints are so useful that we have a whole section in this lecture dedicated to them. They provide the quick and efficient way to control actors placed in a level, as well as responding to global events. Every level has its own level blueprint and it's part of its asset, meaning that when you save a level, you also save its level blueprint. Some tasks can only be performed in a level blueprint, so it's important that we get acquainted with them. And we will. We often say just blueprints when we are referring to different things, so let's take a moment to discuss an important concept here. When you create a blueprint in the Content Browser, that is a class of a blueprint. Classes are a notion from object-oriented programming. A class has a set of attributes and functionality that define the behavior of an actor. When we place the asset in a level, that asset becomes an instance of a class. A class can be instanced as many times as you want. When you make a change to the class, that change is propagated to all its instances. Knowing this, you can devise powerful and efficient workflows for your project. There is a vast hierarchy of classes. Classes can inherit behavior from others and add their own behavior on top of it, leading to an intricate web of interconnected classes. The most basic two are actors and actor components, which inherit from an elemental building block called Unreal Object. Some of the common classes give shape to what is known as the gameplay framework. A pawn, for example, inherits from actor and it adds custom behavior that allows actors to be possessed by a controller. That controller can be you, the player, or an AI controller, such as a member of an AI-driven crowd. Then you have the class Character that inherits from pawn and adds its own extra bit of behavior, sending pawns with movement capabilities. This concept of classes deriving from others and inheriting functionality is essentially what drives Unreal Engine. Another important concept to keep in mind is the process of compiling. We write code with programming languages that we can read, such as connecting nodes together in the case of blueprints. We understand that language. However, computers or hardware don't. We need to turn a readable language into machine language. This machine language is then executed by a CPU, or central processing unit, such as the processor in a smartphone or a desktop computer. Consider that game consoles, smartphones, computers, any device, they all have different requirements. It is mandatory to compile code for every hardware in which it will be executed. However, blueprints work a bit differently. When you compile a blueprint, instead of turning it straight into machine language, it becomes something called byte code. It's kind of something in between, an intermediate language. We can still read it, but it's way more difficult to understand. So we can't understand it. The computer can't either. Then what's the point? Enter virtual machines. Unreal implements its own virtual machine that executes byte code from blueprints, regardless of the target hardware. Consider Notepad. It is an application that runs on Windows. You can't execute it on a smartphone or Mac or Linux. Its code has been designed and compiled for Windows. Now a blueprint is a visual scripting language, yes, but it's still code. And yet you don't have to compile that code for every platform that Unreal supports. This is why the engine implements a virtual machine. The blueprint is compiled. Like any other programming language, but the result of that compilation is executed by a virtual machine, which acts as a layer between the engine and the underlying operating system running on the hardware. And this is why when you hit that compile button, you're not thinking of Windows, Mac or Linux and every platform that Unreal supports. The virtual machine does that job for you. Always keep in mind the concept of inheritance, which will allow you to create efficient and extensible blueprint classes. You can even have your own hierarchy of classes. For example, a parent or base class is inherited by a child. That child, in turn, can also be inherited by any other number of child classes. These child classes may not only bring their own share of functionality to a family of blueprint classes, but even override previous behavior, fundamentally changing how a parent blueprint class works. This concept of inheritance runs deep through Unreal and we've only scratched the surface. Knowing this provides the fascinating insight into the inner workings of the engine and how you can use this vast network of blueprint classes to your advantage, giving you the ability to customize every aspect of the engine. I'm sure this section was a lot to take in, but no worries. You don't have to understand everything to get started. We're going to proceed with some practical examples next, but this is a section you might want to revisit in the future. For now, we're about to take a look at construction scripts and how you can use them to devise an automated workflow.",
