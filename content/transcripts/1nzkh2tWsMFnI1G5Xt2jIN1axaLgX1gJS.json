  "text": " Now before we can get started working on our landscapes, we need to make sure that we are set up for success from the beginning. And that's why we're going to cover in this part our initial project setup. And the first thing that we're going to talk about in our initial project setup is actually creating a brand new project. So what we're going to do is from the Unreal Project Browser, we're going to select the game section. And then from the game section, we're going to select the third person template, leaving all of the project defaults settings enabled, given name, advanced landscapes and press the Create button. So let's go ahead and follow along and do that now. So again, we're going to click on games, make sure that third person is selected, leaving everything over here and the project defaults at its default setting and give this a name of advanced landscapes. We are then going to hit the Create button. And while that creates, let's go ahead and talk about what we're going to do once the editor launches. So the first thing is we're going to enable the Landscape Patch plugin. This is a really cool plugin that allows you to place an actor underneath another actor that will affect the landscape. And this effectively allows you to make foundations for buildings so that when you place this building into a level that has landscape, the landscape will be deformed or brought up or down to match that level. And this is really, really powerful because this means that you don't have to actually hand paint anything when it comes to your landscape in terms of adding buildings or objects that need to sit on top of it. So now that our editor has opened, let's go ahead and bring it on screen. And we're going to come up here to Edit, Plugins, and then we're going to search for our LAND. And then right there, there's our landscape patch. Now when we click this, it is going to give us a warning message. So we're going to click Yes to this. And before we hit Restart Now, we need to do a few other things. So I'm actually going to close the plugins. We're going to pop back over here to our presentation. And the next thing that we are going to be doing is we're going to come over to our Project Settings and we're going to enable virtual texturing support. Now virtual texturing does a number of really great things in terms of performance. But when it comes to open worlds, especially making advanced landscapes, we need this virtual texture support enabled so that we can build the world partition minimap. So let's go ahead and do that now by coming back over here to the editor. We're going to come up here to Edit and then we're going to go to Project Settings. And then we're going to scroll down here on the left-hand side under Engine looking for the rendering section. And once we've clicked on rendering, we're then going to scroll down a little bit more until we locate our virtual textures. And then we have this Enable Virtual Texture Support. So we're going to go ahead and click that on. Now, we do need to restart the editor, but we actually need to do one other thing. So what I'm going to do is instead of restarting it, I'm first going to hit Control Space. And then I'm just going to come in here and grab this characters folder, right click on it and Show and Explorer. And I'm going to pull this up. The reason that we want to do this is because our next option that we want to enable is going to be involving configuring one of our ini files. So in order to get the displacement to work for Nanite tessellation, we need to open up our default engine ini file, locate our script slash engine dot rendering settings, and then input the following two commands, r dot nanite dot allow tessellation equal to one and r dot nanite dot tessellation equal to one. So again, what I did here is I right clicked, found this in Explorer so that when I close this down, what's going to happen here is that's going to make this just a little bit easier to come back up here to our advanced landscapes. And so we're in our Unreal Engine 5 projects, advanced landscapes. We're going to look for our config folder. And then we want our default engine dot ini. So we're going to open that up. And then right under here is our script engine rendering settings. So right down here at the bottom, this is where we're going to input those two commands. So I am just going to copy these from off screen here. Just give me one second. And then I will leave this up for everybody to have a look at so that you can copy it as well. So again, there's r dot nanite dot allow tessellation equal to one and r dot nanite dot tessellation equal to one. When you're done, it's very important that you save this file. All right. So I've saved this. So I'm going to go ahead and close this down. And I will leave this up on the screen for a few more moments so you can go ahead and add this to your project. And remember, make sure you save this file once that's done. And then we're going to restart our project as well. So have a look at this, restart the editor, and we'll be back in just a moment. All right. Now that we are back, what we're going to do now is we're going to check our project to make sure that everything is working. So I'm going to bring the editor back on screen here. And first things first, I'm going to hit control space. And then inside of our content here, I'm just going to right click and look for a material. And I'm not going to name it because we're just going to be checking this to see. And we're going to delete this in a second. So we're just going to double click on it to open it up. And what we want to look for is we want to see this displacement right here. Now displacement is going to be grayed out. So in order to ungray that out, if we come over here in the details panel, we can enable tessellation and there we go. We've got our displacement working. So we can verify that that is working. And I'm going to hit control space and I'm just going to delete this because it's no longer needed. So the next thing that we need to do is we're going to come down here to our starter content and to our textures. And we're just going to right click on any texture. And we're going to look for this convert to virtual texture. This signifies that virtual texture support is enabled in our project. So we are good there. Now the last thing that we need to check is our landscape height map plugins for our circle height patch and our texture patch. So we're just going to select an actor. We're going to come up here to our ad that you can find in the details panel. And then we're just going to search for L, A, and D. There we go. So we see our landscape circle height patch and our landscape texture patch. So those things are working. So that's good. Everything that we need is there. So next what we're going to do is we're going to get some content. And first things first, we are going to import some brushes that we're going to use later on in this tutorial to help affect the landscape. And in order to make everything nice and neat, we're going to put these into a new folder called brushes. So let's go ahead and do that now. So let's pop over to the editor. We're going to hit control space on the keyboard, come up to content, right click, new folder. I'm going to call this brushes. Now with today's class, there should have been some files that you received as well. And inside there, we're going to have this textures folder and we are going to take these impact craters and this T mountain and go ahead and bring those into our brushes folder here just by simply dragging and dropping them from their spot and windows into the content browser. Go ahead and save this. Fantastic. Then next what we're going to do is we are going to go to the Quixel store as well as the Unreal Engine launcher and download and add the following assets to our project. So we're going to add the temperate vegetation spruce forest. And we're also going to add the kikiku, I'm not really sure how to say that, grass and the Donnie willow. So I'm going to leave this on screen for just a moment. Feel free to pause the video here while you search for this inside of the Epic Games launcher. You can find the temperate vegetables in the or the temperate vegetation, I'm sorry, in the Epic Games launcher. And these other two objects will be found inside of Quixel. And if you're unsure how to do this, remember our add, we come up here to add to Quixel and then we can search through our Quixel bridge here for those assets. And the other way that we do this is we come up to our Epic Games launcher here. We can go to the marketplace and we'll give this a second to load here. And then we can look for, there we go. And there it is right there, temperate vegetation spruce forest. We just would add this to our project. And once we have added those, the next thing that we're going to add is the following surfaces that can be found inside of the Quixel bridge plugin. So if you input rocky ground and then the names that you see underneath each one of these, you will find these exact textures. Now, you don't have to use these exact textures. You can use something that is similar, but these are the ones that are being used inside of this video tutorial series. So these are the ones you'd most likely want to use if you want to follow along one to one. So I will leave this up on the screen for a little bit. And once you have all of this selected, you'll be ready to start our next section, which is going to be landscape material creation.",
