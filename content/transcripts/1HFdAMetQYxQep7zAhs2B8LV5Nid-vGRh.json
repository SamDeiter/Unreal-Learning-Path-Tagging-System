  "text": " With our map created, let's start off by using the ocean tool. So I'm just going to hop into my editor here. And with my editor open, I'm just going to go to the plus icon at the top. I'm going to type in water as we did before, and I'm going to look for the ocean first of all. So I'm just going to drag and drop this ocean in here. And you can see that we've got an ocean around our terrain and our landscape right now. So I'm just flying around my editor to just get a better view of this. And you'll see these spline points that I've got around the outside of this island that's been created. And what I can do is I can just select one of these spline points and I can actually move this wherever I want it to go. And it's actually going to update the geometry and the landscape terrain to actually reflect the changes. And we actually have control over all of these settings. We have some properties down here. So on the right hand side, with the ocean, the water body ocean selected, you'll see a whole host of features down here. And the terrain features are what we're specifically looking at here. And we can actually change some of these properties if you want to play around with them. So we've got things like the elevation curve asset, which is a float curve. So you can assign any kind of curve based asset in here and change the way the fall off may happen. We also have the channel edge, channel depth, curve ramp width. You can play around with all these kind of different settings. And we've also got some fall off settings as well. So these are all the kind of details panel options that you can use to update the water body ocean tool. And you can just have a play around with these tools and kind of get a result that you're wanting from your landscape here. And then to show you the power of what the ocean tool can be capable of, we've got a classic. Here's one I made earlier example where you can see that we've really got some more erosion going on. We still got the same number of spline points. The spline points are still around this semi circular type of approach. But like with the settings here, you can see that we've got some more custom fall off settings. We've got the channel edge offset, channel depth, the curve ramp width here. So if you want to copy these properties, feel free to do so. But it's more about playing around with the properties, trying to get a feel for what it is that you want. We've also got in the effects section, we've got the curl noise dialed in here. And so if you just would like to look at any of these settings, you can dig into the maps yourself. But essentially, it's whatever kind of outcome and effect you would like with your map. So hopefully that just gives you an example of what can be created with this ocean tool without you having to sculpt everything yourself. You can get a lot of mileage just from dialing in some of these numbers here. And before we close out the use of the ocean tool, it might be just be worth touching upon the use of LOD settings that you might be able to incorporate into your oceans so that you can get a bit better performance out of them. So if we select the water mesh actor in the map here, we have something called a far distance material that can be used to make the ocean cheaper. So if we select the water mesh actor and then under if you type in far distance, you'll see a far distance material. And then if you just assign the water underscore far mesh material to it, then you can then see that it'll have a more performant use within your project. So you can set the traction distance and the far mesh distance extent so that you can dial it into whatever value works for your project. So here's an example of this number. But again, mileage may vary, depends on the project that you're wanting to use it on. But it is worth considering using a far distance material so that you get a little bit more performant on the on the more distant the ocean is in the map.",
