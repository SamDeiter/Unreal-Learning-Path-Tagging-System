  "text": " In this lesson, we're going to take a look at the outline for the course, and then we're also going to look at derived data catches. So let's get started. First up, we're going to be looking at derived data catch and what that is, the types and how to set it up, the world scope and initial setup from there, and then we'll also look at the subtopics, examining workflows, determining shots and assets, and using mega scans when it comes to building your world. Next we'll look at basic lighting. In that, we'll actually focus on environment light mixer, how to use that, and setup lighting. Look at editing assets next, using construction blueprints, using PCGs, using basic blueprints for workflows, modeling tools, level management, stage monitor overview, and level snapshot overview. Next we'll look at material overview, optimizing and instancing, foliage quicktake, usages in that case, and profiling quicktake. Now let's take a look at using derived data catch. So most people wonder what exactly is this. So depending on how your project and system are configured, there can be several derived data catches in a hierarchy that ranges from fast to slow. When assessing derived data, your system will do the following to determine how quickly it can access it. When a piece of derived data is needed, the fastest catch is checked first, then the next fastest and so on until the data is found. When the data is found, it is copied into the fastest local catch so that it is quicker to access next time. If the data is not found, then it is first generated, then asynchronously copied into catches so it is available for you and potentially your team in the future. Unreal creates a DDCs for you, allowing you to share them across projects. So let's look at what it is. Content stored in the DDC is disposable and can be generated at any time using the data stored in the U asset file. Storing these derived formats externally makes it possible to easily add or change the formats used by the engine without needing to modify the source asset file. So typically, here are some of the types. You'll have at least the following two catches. Boot DDC startup files that are loaded in memory to increase boot times. For example, project dr slash derived data catch boot dot DDC. And then locally, local DDC, derived data for your projects. For example, engine dir slash derived data catch. And you can see the documentation here, which will give you a better breakdown of exactly how those look and how they work. However, your project may also be set up to use a DDC pack or shared DDC. Now let's go ahead and take a look in Unreal at the data locations and where to pull up this information and how to change settings according to your needs. You'll find the derived data catch down below here. So you'll see catch settings. So let's pull that up first. And in here, you can choose where your global and local are going to be where your global local is going to go and your global shared is going to go. And you'll see the paths laid out here. There's also enable notifications if you want and enable AWS. So if you're using an AWS workflow, you have that available. And there's also global local S3 DDC path. So you have multiple things you can use catering to your projects. You also will notice down below when you go derived data catch, there's view catch settings or statistics, excuse me. And here you'll see the statistics of what has been loaded and how it's working. Next you'll go in here and go to view resource usage and pull that up. And this will tell you how your resources are being used. Next, let's take a look here at setting up sharing. As you may see in the base engine I&I, the editor is already set up to use a shared DDC that can be enabled one of three ways. And override as pictured to the right in the default engine I&I for your project that sets the path to a valid location for your team. So again, you can choose where these paths are at and how things are going to be set And you can edit that I&I if you need to. Set an environment variable as pictured to the right of the Unreal Engine shared data catch path. And you'll see I have it here as UE-shared on a Mac Linux Unreal Engine underscore shared data catch path to the folder to use. In the editor, set the shared derived data catch variable. So this is all set up and ready to go. You can also map this in such a way so that you're using a network system setup. So an internal network mounting your DDC folder. Let's look at this. For the DDC to be used over your internal network, the folder that contains the DDC must be mounted to a network drive. If you're unfamiliar with how to do this, see the map link here. So I have it here on how to map that out and in Windows. Microsoft is nice enough to give you a breakdown for that. And it's extremely helpful. And then your IT department can get you set up and running. So you're all pulling from the same location. An example of a shared drive would be Epic Games dot net root DDC dash global Fortnite. Here's some additional links here for resources so you can get up and running and understand how the system works. That's it for this section of the lesson. In the next section, we're going to be talking about world scope and initial setup when it comes to building your world for virtual production. Thanks again.",
