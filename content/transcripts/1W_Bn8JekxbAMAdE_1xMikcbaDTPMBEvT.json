  "text": " Okay, so as promised, we're going to circle back and talk about state machines. So I'm going to hop into Unreal Engine. And the first thing I'm going to do is disconnect the output pose with the alt click. Then I'm just going to zoom out, right click pan, and I'm bringing the output pose all the way back to the top. And then grab the default state machine and connect it to the output pose and compile. So if we double click on the default state machine, I just want to talk about how the state machine is used to blend animations with transitions. And as you can see, there are four different states. And if you hover your mouse over the idle run state, and then you also hold Ctrl and Alt, you get some really cool information from the documentation page. So that's a free tip for you there. And if we double click on the idle run state, we can see that the speed affects the animation output. In fact, if I double click on the idle run blend space, it's the orange one in the asset browser. We can see if I drag the green diamond back and forth, that a speed of zero would output an idle animation. And then a speed of 375 would produce a full run. So I'm going to go back to the third person and in BP tab. And then just to get back to the animation graph, I'm going to follow these breadcrumbs and I'll click on the word default. And now we're looking at the different states again. Now in addition to the states, there's also these transition rules with these little arrows. So if I click on the idle run to jumpstart transition rule, we can see that the animation transition time is 0.2 seconds. And there's also these different curves. And if I also do the Ctrl Alt trick, I can preview the different curves for the ease in and the ease out. And hermite cubic is pretty good curve for default. Now if I double click the jumpstart state, it's pretty simple. It just plays an animation. And then if I hit the back arrow and I hover over the next transition rule, I can see that as soon as the asset has less than 0.1 seconds left in the animation, it will just automatically go to the jump loop state. And the jump loop animation, it will repeat over and over until the character is no longer in the air. And then the jump animation. And when there's less than 0.1 seconds left in that animation, we're back to the original idle run state. So that's how it works. Hopefully that helps you understand what you're looking at. I know it's a lot of different arrows and nested functionality, things like that. And I also want to point out, if I go back to the animation graph, that the blend poses by bool and the blend poses by int, they also have these blend type curves. And you can also preview them. And they also have similar concepts of transition time. They just are usually at the bottom of the node. So there's some similar functionality between the default state machine and these nodes right here, because they're dealing with animation transitions. And lastly, if you want to experiment with animation blueprints on your own, let's click on the third person example map and check out the content browser and the third person and MVP. That is the asset that we've been working with right here. And to create a new one, all we have to do is right click on any of these green animations, go to find skeleton. And then once you've located the skeleton, you right click on that, go to create, and you can create an anim blueprint. So just click on anim blueprint. And I could call it, I don't know, many underscore anim BP, something like that. And then you could double click and start experimenting. And we will start talking about physics in the next video.",
