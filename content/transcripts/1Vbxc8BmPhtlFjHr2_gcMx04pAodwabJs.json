  "text": " Let's now dive into the tools inside of Unreal Engine, starting with the sequence of tools and features. So when you open the sequence of window, it will look something like this as a workflow. So it'll be empty by default, but as you add shots, as you add sub scene tracks, you'll end up with a composition roughly like this. So you can add sub scenes by going to track and adding a sub scene track, and you may want a different sub scene track per department. And what that allows you to do it allows you to all work on the same shot track whilst editing different properties. So these are all just empty containers until you add content to it. But it means that as you're working and people add more, say someone's refining the camera track and you're doing VFX, as soon as you update their camera track, you'll have the new edits and you'll be able to time your VFX perfectly to the camera track. So it just allows everyone to work in parallel using their content. So broadly speaking, you may have character animation as a sub scene, you may have effects, cameras, lighting and sound, but this is totally dependent on your production. You may end up with two or three of these instead of five, you may end up with more. The main thing is to keep all the content modular when editing so that multiple people can be working on the shots and it allows you to all be working in parallel. So when we're looking at the sub scenes here, you can quickly organize the sequence of workflows as well. So sub scene tracks can be deeply nested and used to break down what between departments. So you've got your higher level kind of view on this shot here. But then if we double clicked in the character one, for example, you may see another three sub scenes there as well. You may have one per character. So you may have a sub scene per character because you have three different character artists or animators working on these shots and it may be that you want to keep them extrapolated out as well. Similar with the VFX, you may have multiple VFX going on and you want people working in parallel. Maybe if it came to the cameras, you only have one camera person, so you may only have one track there. But again, just think what works best for your projects. You can split tracks out as deeply nested as you would like them to be, as in getting as granular as you'd like it to be. And ultimately it depends on the number of people working on the project and how much need over that sequencer. Looking at animation blending, once we do get into the animation, animation blending allows us many edit options. So if you click this drop down here, you can allow all edits and which means that we have access to motion blended options, which is bone matching and can be used in conjunction with animation blending. And then we have animation track blending, which includes easing option presets. So we can see the properties that we have here. You can see that we have overlapping animations, which will allow them to blend from one animation to another. And you also have these properties here, which for example, you can match this bone in the next clip and just try to get a bit more bone matching and track blending set up inside of sequencer. On the actual transform tracks, you have standard transforms, which are absolute additive, which is the most common relative and additive from base. So whenever you're on a transform track and you want to add a type of transform, you can just click this section button here and you can add absolute additive, relative or additive from base. And that will allow you to have your transform tracks inside of sequencer. And also if you're working with control rig, you could have an absolute and additive track as well. So that's created for every control on the control rig. So it gives you more granular detail over each control on the control rig there. And in sequencer, to access the curves editor, if you recall before, if I just go back a section, you can click this little button here, which will open the sequencer curves track. And so when we have sequencer curves open, you can see that we can edit on a key basis as well. So these curves work with the level editor, take recorder, any cinematic assets, blueprints in Niagara, Niagara being the VFX system for Unreal Engine and blueprints being the visual scripting system. We've got control rig and composure. So we have multiple keys that we can edit here, change the curve settings and also just retime anything that we want to there.",
