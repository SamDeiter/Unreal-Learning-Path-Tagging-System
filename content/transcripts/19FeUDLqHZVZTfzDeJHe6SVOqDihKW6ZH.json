  "text": " Now, to close out the course here, let's just go through a few leaving thoughts here. This is slightly more advanced, so if you've got this far and you think that's good enough for me, that's great and I hope it's been really valuable for you. But especially if you're more of a, maybe a technical designer or an engineer, you might want to start thinking about a few different methodologies, which I just wanted to introduce to you, which you can then take on your learning journey with you. So casting on a case by case basis, you saw us casting to the game instance, for example, when we had to get variables from there. So very simple to implement. You saw us casting, it's easy to digest. It can be difficult to maintain, you know, you saw us casting multiple times, so it leads to a duplication of work and casts can be expensive because you're casting to the entire class and anything that's referenced in that class. So cast, you know, as a small prototype, small games, you know, don't be too hard on yourself if you're casting a lot, but as games scale, cast can be expensive and come with memory overheads, exactly like when we were talking about the get all actors of class function from earlier in the slide deck. Also, you can use inheritance, which saves a lot of work. So you saw us using classes that inherited from parent classes, which, you know, does save you a lot of time when you can get a lot of stuff for free. You saw us using that third person mannequin that came for free, essentially. It can lead to bloated inheritance. You know, we didn't necessarily use everything in that third person character, you know, so that, you know, there's bloated elements that can come there. They can be difficult to then break apart if we're inheriting too much. And, you know, again, especially as you scale in, they may become a hindrance. Also using interfaces, which we did not touch upon, but interfaces are a very lightweight and no inheritance of possibility, possibly irrelevant data, because you just send packets of data using an interface. So that gives us some really nice modularity. So if you want to look into using blueprint interfaces in Unreal Engine, that is a good blueprint communication tool. It can lead to some code duplication. And so just make sure you're paying attention when you're using interfaces. We're also looking at hard referencing here. So looking at these examples here, whenever you create a direct reference to another actor, you'll see the blue reference icon here in the bottom left hand corner, where the red arrow is, you can see that blue little capsule. And when we were talking about casting before and we had to cast to an actor, it pulls with it all of its reference data. So if I cast it to this some actor class, which is at the top of the blueprint window here, not only would it cast to this actor, it would cast and pull in the some texture because it's hard referenced. Now, if I move to soft references at the bottom left hand corner here, you can see that that is a more tealy kind of color. And that is now a soft reference, which it gives you references to the actor in class. Maybe it's a sound base, you asset in your content browser, which you can then use to async load in this example. So again, this is more technical design territory and maybe engineering territory. But just thinking about hard and soft referencing in your project will save a lot of overhead if you understand that concept. So if that's something you want to look into, I definitely recommend you explore that further. And that wraps us up. I really hope the gameplay framework wasn't too intimidating for you and at least gives you a very good starting point, especially if you're coming from other engines or other tool sets and you were just unsure what data was available, the communication between the different framework classes and also just where to store your data. Hopefully, you know, the little workshop that we did was a really helpful introduction of just how we might communicate across classes. So really hope you found this course useful and thank you again for watching.",
