  "text": " Now we're going to create a material function. I'm going to skip over simple grass wind for now. That's something you can call up and look at on your own. You can see how complex they get. We saw a little bit of that. Now we're getting into function inputs. Let's go back to Unreal Engine and start to create a material function that will use these caustics. This is the system that we'll be creating. Actually, this is the material. And we'll be creating this too. What we're really interested in is this material function. You've seen some of them already. And you can see how amazing they can be. Here's the one that we'll be building to create this caustic effect. Now it looks daunting. It looks pretty complicated. And it is complicated, but it's only complicated because there are minor offsets. A lot of things are repeated over and over again. And they're offset slightly to create complexity. But the ideas are not that complex, as we'll see. So let's get on your way. You can take this window. And if you have a second monitor, move it off to the next monitor. So to create a material function, this system will need to add a material function in our in-class material by right clicking in the content browser. And instead of choosing material, let's scroll down among these other options, which are myriad, tons of options here. Let's go to materials and textures and find material function. There's a little F symbol next to it, which is the mathematical symbol for function. And we'll, using the Allard convention, we'll call it MF for material function, underscore, we'll call it wave. And hit Enter. And when we double click, it opens. It opens in my window down below. And we'll make this full screen. And the first thing we see is an error. We see it in the stats window. As I've mentioned, when an error occurs, the stats panel will pop up. And it says missing function input result. So if we look at the result node, we see that it's previewing. And it's previewing in the preview window. It says as much. And it's calling out what the error is at the top as well. So it's previewing. It's set to preview, but there's nothing to preview. This is empty. So the way to fix this, to resolve it, is to right click on the output result and tell it to stop preview node, since there's nothing to preview. And then it goes black. All the error messages go away. I'm going to close the stats panel. And we're ready to get underway. I mean, you could proceed even if the error was there. It's just annoying to have to look at. So as you may recall from our result here, our completed version of it, we need a decent amount of space over here before we get to our output result. So I've moved every, I've moved, I've created some space for myself. And what we're doing is we're taking a 2D texture and we're perturbing it over time to create the illusion of caustics. So to have control over that, we'll need to control the texture coordinates. And for that, you may recall, you can either search for it by right clicking and searching for texture coordinates, or I'm going to left click to clear that, hold down the U key and left click, and you get the texture coordinate node. Next, we'll need something called a function input. And we'll be using several of these function inputs to control what the outcome is. Function inputs are really powerful and really quite versatile, as you'll see going through building our material function. To call up a function input, we'll right click on the grid and search for function input. I sometimes use input function and I end up getting there. We see that the default function input is a vector 3. But since we're working really only with textures and texture coordinates, we know that textures are 2D, not 3D. We need to change this from vector 3 to something that is vector 2. So in the details, we can change it with this input type drop down menu, and we can select from among the options there, vector 2. We also want to label this so that we can work with it later We'll call this coordinates. And we'll pull our result string from texture coordinates into the preview of our coordinates vector 2. Next, we'll want to offset our 2D textures from one another. And to do that, we'll use two constants, and not something that we really need to adjust later. So we can just use two constants. They don't have to be parametric. We can just use two constants. So we can just use two constants. They don't have to be parametric or anything. So by holding down the 2 key, and we'll need three of these to build this system, hold down the 2 key and left click once, twice, three times. And we'll put values that are somewhat random to ensure that our texture maps are offset from one another. And to do that, we'll make the first one 0.41. The second value we'll make 0.35. For the next one, we'll make the top one, the first value 0.86. And tab to the bottom one and make it 0.14. Notice that all of my values are below one so that it doesn't make everything too crazy. This one approaches one, but it's still below one. It'll work better if you stay below one. But it can be pretty much any number below one. So we'll make the top one 0.65. And tab to the bottom one, make it closer to 1.75. And those are good starting ones. Next, we'll need to stack these together to control the UVs. And for that, we'll use an add function. We'll use three add functions. Hold down the A key. And we'll take the result from our vector 2D, I'm sorry, just vector 2 input function, and pipe it into the A channel. And take our constant 2 and pipe it into the B channel. We'll pipe each of these two constant vectors into the B channel. And we'll take our input function and pipe those into each of the A channels of the add. Now we have the start of the system. We're already starting to build the complexity that will pull this magic trick off. The next thing we'll need to do is start to create animation for it. So we have position information and offsets. And now we need to add animation. And so for animation, we'll use a simple pattern as we have in the past. And we'll need four of those. So if you hold down the P key and left click, let's get away from add first. And just with the grid selected, hold down the P key and click four times to get four patterns. So we'll take the results of our add and pipe them into the coordinates of each of our patterns. And the top one will take the results of our vector 2 and the top one will take the results of our vector 3. And we'll take the results of our vector 2 input function and can't select. Can't select the pin and pipe it into the top pattern's coordinates. Now we'll want to animate these. We have different offsets here. We want to offset them in the way that they are animated. So to do that, we'll create values for each of these patterns so that each of their animations are offset a little bit in time. In speed, actually, x and y. And for that, we'll choose the top pattern and we'll set its x speed to 0.1, its bottom to 0.1. For the next one, we'll set those to, we'll basically invert it. Set it to negative 0.1, tab to negative 0.1 for the second, for the y value. So the next one will change x from y in speed by setting the top one to say negative 0.1 and the bottom to just 0.1. And then the bottom one will just invert those. So the top is 0.1 and the bottom is negative 0.1. So now the maps themselves, their UVs will be offset and they'll be offset in time, in speed, I should say, along x and y. Next, we'll need texture samplers. We'll need a texture to actually have this system act on. And so for that, we'll need four texture samples for each of the patterns. Holding down the T key and left clicking, we can add four texture samples. And I might be getting ahead of myself. Actually, I want to, we'll be working with these in a moment, but I want to control the time component of the patterns in addition to the speed. And for that, we'll use another function input similar to what we have up here. So down below our offsets and our adds, let's create another function input. Another function input on the grid, right click and type function inputs. Function input. And this needs to be a scalar input. So a single value. So with that selected, we'll change the input type to the top one scalar. And to ensure that Unreal Engine pays attention to it and doesn't ignore this input in the first slot, in the x slot, we'll change the value from zero to one. Another thing that we want to do is, and we want to do this for all function inputs. We want to tick off in the details panel, use preview value as default. In earlier versions of Unreal Engine, it would sometimes ignore the function input if this wasn't ticked off, if it wasn't selected. Actually, we should do it up here too. So we'll go to input coordinates and turn it on there as well. So this bottom one, the one that we just added, we want to give it a name. Now that we've turned it on, we want to call it speed. That's what it's going to be working on.",
