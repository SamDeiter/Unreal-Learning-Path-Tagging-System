  "text": " Next up we'll talk about creating a blueprint for pre-computed lighting and what we'll cover here is we'll talk about some level streaming and we'll give you an overview of the walkthrough and how you may go about setting up different lighting scenarios. So in an empty map here I've just called my map level streaming and for this purpose it's important to know about naming conventions and what we're streaming here. It's completely up to you what you call them but you just need to make sure they're consistent. So the first thing I'll do just to show you an example of this even though this isn't necessarily lighting I'm going to show you a post-process example here. So what I'll do is I'll just make sure this isn't ticked by default, yours shouldn't be ticked by default and then I will first type unbound into my post-process and I will tick that and it essentially just means the post-process affects the entire world and then I will go to scene color tint which is under the miscellaneous tab inside of color grading I'm just going to give this a color say of pink and then just so you know what properties have changed what's a useful button to click is the settings option here and if you show only modified properties I like this functionality when you're trying to dial in certain properties that you've already adjusted it kind of cleans up the menu a little bit so up to you if you want to use that. What I will do is I will go to the levels tab and if you don't have this levels tab open by default you can just go to a window and then you just want to make sure levels is selected there and you can drop it in whichever window you would like and then I will go to levels and create new I'm going to create an empty level and I'll create it and my first map was called level streaming which you'll see at the top there so I'm still going to call this level streaming and then I'll call this underscore pink for example which is the pink level. Now I've got this level currently selected you can see this highlighted blue now if you think about this in terms of like almost like a layer in Photoshop or any other program that you use this is the currently selected layer if I double click the persistent level again which is our level streaming we've got a persistent level here so now I've got almost like a sub layer of this persistent level so with it double clicked I'm going to select my post process volume I'm going to hit ctrl and m and that actually moves the volume onto the pink level streaming if I change the visibility of this level now if I hide it that's removed that post process volume so if I toggle it on and I toggle it off that will hide and unhide it. Now if I go to file save all even if this level is visible when I click play so I'm just going to hit alt and p I'm playing this level now but you can't see the pink now that's because this level is not loaded by default if you wanted it loaded by default you could right click change the streaming method and go to always loaded and therefore it removes the little dot next to it and when I hit alt and p to play it's now loaded so I don't want this loaded by default so I'm just going to right click change streaming method and go back to the blueprint version of streaming method because that's what this tutorial is about and you'll see the little dot there and whenever you're working with lighting as of course this is a post process volume at the moment but if you're working with lighting it's good to take the toggle lighting scenario and that makes Unreal account for some pre-computed lighting scenarios and so if you had like a daytime scene a nighttime scene a golden hour scene for example you could toggle the different lighting scenarios and it would be pre-baked into that and all light maps would be stored inside of this stream level instead of baking it on the asset so if you're wanting to just toggle lighting scenarios that's a really powerful tool to have. I'm just going to file save all and now what I want to do is I want to create maybe two or three more versions of this pink level so I can show you how we're toggling through these different scenarios so I'll again go to levels I'll create a new level I'm going to select empty level again I'll pre-select something that was a pink one and I'm just going to rename it to green for example and I'll do that and then I'll do a last one create new empty level I'll again get the naming convention and what colors should we go for there let's go for orange so I'll save that and I go to file save all and then we want to go back and find our post-process volume so if I go to the outliner and I find the post-process volume sometimes it's good just to create a naming convention as well so maybe I'll call this pp underscore pink so I know which post-process volume it is now the pink post-process volume is on the pink level as we saw before now if I have say a different level selected so now the orange level is selected and I duplicate this post-process volume and if I hide now the pink level you'll still see that post-process volume quite faintly here on the left hand side if I turn off the visibility on that pink level that post-process volume disappeared and because I duplicated this post-process volume with the orange level selected this post-process volume is now on this level so instead of hitting control and m like we did before I've just duplicated it onto the current streaming level so I'll go to my scene tint I'll go to orange select new and then what I'll do is I'll duplicate this again by holding down alt on my keyboard and I'll do the different method this way so I'll double click now on my green level and I'll hit control and m to move it onto the green level I'll change this to green and if I hide my orange level now I've got my green post-process volume so let's just save all and let's just check these are working so I've got my green I'll hide my green I've got my orange and I've got my pink so this is just a really nice way of just pre-visualizing these level streaming methods that we're going to be using now they're all going to be blueprint driven so again just right click you don't need to change this it should be there by default but change streaming method just make sure they're all on blueprint we don't want them loaded by default so if I went to file save all and I just hit alt and p to play again no no colors are currently selected so now let's jump into blueprints and actually get some streaming setup we will go to blueprints at the top here and we will open our level blueprint and we will just pin this to the top bar now it's important to note that each one of these levels also has its own level blueprint if you wanted to house any code on there we're going to put all the code on the persistent level this persistent level is loaded and visible by default so you generally want to put any key information onto this persistent level streaming level but you can house blueprint code on level streaming if you want I've also just quickly noticed that the toggle lighting scenario so if these were all three lighting scenarios that you had lighting on that you wanted to bake you just want to make sure those three are toggled there but let's jump into blueprints now we can just delete what's currently there we don't need that and I'm just going to right click and press the hash key on my keyboard you can press whatever input type you like but I'm just going to use the hash key and again like previous examples you can change the input key if you want by selecting this button here it goes orange and if I press c on my keyboard for example that input would change to c so I always just start with hash just because it's the quickest input to find and then you can change it from there pretty pretty easily so I'll just save and compile just make sure everything's still working now the two functions that we want to be working with today is unload which is unload stream level by name so this unload stream level by name and then we also want to have a load stream level by name so if you type load you'll have load stream level by name as well so these are the two levels that we want to be working with here so this will unload a stream level this will load a stream level and the level name that it will load and unload is if we go back into our tab it's these levels that aren't currently loaded so let's start with the green example so the way I like to do this I like to right click on the stream level I like to find it in the content browser when it finds it in the content browser I'll single click just to go into rename mode or you can right click rename or you can even hit f2 on it but I'll hit ctrl c to get the name and I'll go back into the level streaming and in load I'll go to a paste there so ctrl and v just to paste that name in I copy and paste the names rather than manually typing them out because these level names need to be exactly what the other level name is called so if you misspell anything it could break your game so I'm just going to go to unpressed hash key I'm just going to load this level just see let's see what it's doing you can play around with the make visible after load I like to tick that and just compile and save and if we go to level streaming now hit alt and p we're playing the game now I'm going to hit the hash key and now I've loaded the green level in and you'll see that on this side here the level is now visible so we've got the persistent level still loaded and now we're streaming in this sub data so you can imagine now quite quickly that if you had a nighttime scene a daytime scene and a golden hour scene you could then cycle through these different levels to test out the different lighting scenarios that you might have in your experience here so we'll use a multi-gate to toggle through each of these level streaming functions now so I'll just give myself a bit of space and going back to a multi-gate that we've used previously I'll select multi-gate here so I've got a multi-gate and I will load first the green and then I'll copy by ctrl c ctrl v and I'll ctrl c ctrl v again I'll add a pin I'll go to the different out outputs so again we're just reusing functionality that we've used previously now I will promote the loop output to a variable as well we'll call this scene switch and again we can just rename this variable up here if you want to rename it I'll give it a category I like to always keep things organized here especially as your level blueprints start getting bigger so we'll just call this streaming and you can also I just control uh compile and save sorry and then you can also promote this to a variable we'll call this starting scene index or you can call this whatever makes most sense to you in your level here and then we'll give it the category as well streaming so again we're just repeating a lot of functionality we previously learned here and so we've we're streaming the green level in first and then we'll go back into our level streaming we'll find our orange level next I'm going to ctrl c and I'll ctrl v the next name into there and of course because we've kept the same naming convention I could just type pink in here but just for uniformity I'll just copy the pink name and I'll paste this name now an important key to note to make here is we're loading in the levels but we're not unloading the previous level so let's go ahead and use this unload stream level by name function now so I just want to drag that in there I'm going to ctrl c and ctrl v and the reason why I need two is because I just want to make sure if the green is loaded orange and pink are not loaded so I'm just going to grab orange paste here and again copying and pasting will save you a lot of time and misspellings and then I'll just ctrl c ctrl v and now it's just trying to work as efficiently with the keyboard as we can by ctrl c ctrl v so if orange is loaded we want to unload the green and the pink if pink is loaded we want to unload orange and green so green visible orange and pink not orange visible green and pink not and then pink visible orange and green not and so as long as you have the loop selected by default again you don't have to but what it will do is it'll make that infinitely repeat itself so I just want to compile and save I go back into my level streaming I'll hit alt and p now there's nothing loaded by default and you could set something on begin play if you wanted but I'm just going to press the hash key I'm going to press the hash key again I'm going to press the hash key again and we'll just keep cycling and so that's a really nice functionality to test different lighting scenarios out within your maps the last thing I'll do just as a bit of bonus cleanup I'm just going to select everything I'll hit ctrl I'll just hit c on the keyboard sorry and we'll just call this level streaming setup or something like that it gives it a title I can move this title around I'll maybe give it a bit of a comment color I'll maybe drop the alpha just to make things look a little bit nicer maybe I'll change the font size as well because this is quite a big powerful functionality in the level it just keeps things nice and organized so hopefully that gives you a good idea about how you might use level streaming and a pre-computed lighting within your levels",
