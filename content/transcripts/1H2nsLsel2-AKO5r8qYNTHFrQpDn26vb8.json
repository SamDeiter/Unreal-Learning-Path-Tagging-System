  "text": " Next up, let's talk about using the lake tools inside of Unreal Engine. So we'll hop back into our editor here. And this time, again, we just got our landscape here. And I'm just going to type water when I select here. And this time I want to get the water body lake. So you can see very similar effect as our ocean tool that we just used previously. And essentially this just affects lakes in a very similar way to the ocean tool. So in this example, again, we could look at the curl noise a bit. The curl noise is something that will always have a lot of impact on your lake. So you could have curl one amount, curl two amount, dial it in, see what values kind of tend to work for you here. Maybe a 0.2 value, maybe a 0.1, maybe a curl two amount of 0.5. Again, you can get different effects on how much offset you want. It's going to very much vary on what you're wanting from your projects. But again, it's just worth highlighting the lake tool, playing around with all the different values. Dial it in as you dial the ocean in. And yeah, have fun with that tool.",
