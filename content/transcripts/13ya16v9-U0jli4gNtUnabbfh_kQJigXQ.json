  "text": " Our introduction to optimization tutorial series is first going to start by having us take a look at how we think about optimization throughout the lifetime of our Unreal Engine 5 projects. We'll then move on to ways we can optimize our projects right from our project's initial creation. We'll then take a look at how we can optimize our texture content as well as optimize both static and skeletal mesh content. We'll then have a look at how we can use Unreal's materials systems to help optimize our material as well as our material workflow. We'll then take a look at the various optimization view modes Unreal Engine 5 provides to help us visually debug areas that could be prone to performance or optimization issues and help us provide better ideas on how to go about solving those performance or optimization issues. Finally, we'll take a look at the number of tools Unreal Engine 5 provides to help us optimize our projects no matter which platform we happen to be developing for. We've got a lot to cover, so let's go ahead and get started with optimization philosophy.",
