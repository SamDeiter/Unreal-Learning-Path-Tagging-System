And also we can also hold a 3d widget component. So if you see this components box at the top left hand side here, you can see an add button, you can actually add widgets to this blueprint, which is really powerful functionality. Here's the vehicle blueprint component. And then also we have our scene setup. So we just have this blank level, we've got a camera actor. And if you go into the camera actor properties, you want to make sure auto activate for player is player zero. And this means that we can possess this camera like we were talking about before with our controller, we can take input when we actually want to play this experience. We have a rec light setup, you can use a point light as well. They're both set to stationary. We want the vehicle in there. And then we've just created a cube, which is the mesh floor, and just stretched out there. So that's the basic scene setup that we'll be working with today.",
