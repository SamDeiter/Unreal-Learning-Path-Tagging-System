  "text": " From there, let's take a look at the object lifecycle. Creating a new object in Unreal is as easy as calling the new object line with the appropriate parameters. When we actually create the object, the following operations are going on under the hood. We malloc the raw data, finding out how big it is, and allocating the associated memory footprint for it. We then call memset zero and clear all the associated memory because we're about to populate it. We then call the classes constructor. It initializes the virtual table and initializes all properties within that block of memory. From there, we copy over the archetype with a mem copy, and Unreal works from a template system called the class default object. We then have the post construction initialization, which is where we duplicate all values from the CDO into this new block of data. From there, we load all properties from configuration files. We load all properties that we require from .config or .ini files through a get defaults call. Lastly, we call postinit properties, which is a gameplay function that we can implement and use to drive gameplay logic. Actors have a very specific lifecycle that we can absolutely use to our advantage. Actors have a huge number of virtual functions that we can override to add gameplay functionality. Let's take a look at how we can spawn an actor and break down its subsequent lifecycle. As an actor is in the world, we need to root our spawn through the world we wish to spawn it into and give it a transform to spawn out. So in this example, we've got a transform defined. In this case, we'll just use its default values. We then grab a reference to the world that we want to spawn the actor in and call its template is spawn actor function. We give it a template, in this case, just actor, and pass it in a class that we'd like to spawn and a transform that we'd want it to spawn at. As mentioned on the opening slide, actors have got a number of critical functions that are important for us to understand when building systems. Initialize components, pre and post, is called when spinning up the actor. This function is passed through to any components that are on the said actor for their own initializations. BeginPlay is called as soon as the actor is spawned and is usable, it's essentially finished its initialization at this point. Tick is called at regular intervals with every frame being its default, with delta time being passed in as a parameter. The length of a frame may vary wildly on a per client basis, so using delta time in our calculations is fairly critical. Frame rates can be locked on both client and server with the tick frequency changing accordingly. However, we can also explicitly define our tick frequency in the constructor of the class should we want a very infrequent but consistent tick. A tick can also be turned off and unregistered entirely if your technical design doesn't require it. EndPlay is the actor's spin down function and it's the opposite of BeginPlay. Typically this is used as a cleanup function. Call it destroy on an actor marks it as pending kill and begins the process of destroying the actor. This involves calling beginDestroy, finishDestroy, and finally freeing up the memory. Destroy is often called by engineers and it's eventually rooted down into EndPlay, so we don't have to call that manually. It's important to note that we can still access the actor whilst it's in the process of being destroyed, but it will have the RF pending kill flag set on it. We can see here that the actor lifecycle is actually fairly complex and there's a number of different ways we can initialize an actor. We can see on the right hand side that the actual spawning can be instant or deferred. Deferred gives us a chance to change a value on said actor before it hits BeginPlay and any subsequent gameplay functions that we've hooked in. We can also see on the left that loading a map also roots through the same BeginPlay code as our explicit spawning does, whether it be from the direct loading of a map or from clicking play in the editor. We can also see that when and where EndPlay or destroy is called is also fairly fluid. We can call destroy ourselves, we can give an actor a lifetime, or we can simply exit the application. Regardless, we need to make sure that we're not leaving any actors unaccounted for. They all root through EndPlay functionality, marking them for kill and the eventual garbage collection.",
