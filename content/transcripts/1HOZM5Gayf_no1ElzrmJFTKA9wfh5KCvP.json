  "text": " As promised, we'll talk about waves and buoyancy to close out this section here. So we can actually control the wave generation for oceans and rivers and streams using this water waves asset. So the asset is created by right clicking in the content browser. So you just head into your content browser, right click, go to water, and then go to water waves. And then inside this asset, we can adjust the amount of waves, wave height, wind direction, and just many other parameters that we've seen here. And you can do this, assign it to your water assets. So if you created a my wave asset, for example, and decided on some values similar to what you see in this image here, you can then get this asset and assign the water waves asset to any of the water assets that you've created, whether it be ocean, lakes, rivers, that kind of thing. You can assign this custom asset so that you have a bit more control over those properties. And then with buoyancy, we can not only make objects float in the river, but we can also have the current carry them along. So to add buoyancy, first make a new active blueprint. So this can just be an empty blueprint inside of Unreal Engine. And then we want to add, inside the active blueprint, we want to add this buoyancy component. So when we go to add component, we want to select buoyancy. And then we also just want to add a static mesh and make sure the static mesh is the root of the blueprint. And we'll do this in editor in a second. So you can actually see the step-by-step process there. So I just want to give you the high level information before we jump into editor. And then we can select the buoyancy component. And then in the details panel, we can set how buoyant we want these actors to be. So to make objects float, you just need to add and position pontoons, which allows objects to float. So you can see that the pontoons index right here, I will jump in editor to show you exact values, but P1 is going to be 50, 50. P2 is going to be minus 50, minus 50. P3 is going to be 50 and then minus 50. And then P4 is going to be minus 50 and then plus 50. And then the radius is going to be 125. So let's jump in editor here. You'll see that we're going to create something like this. So the better you position, the size of your pontoons, the better buoyancy will work. It's not a physical simulation of buoyancy, but it's a good enough representation for games. So if you're looking for something that's going to be physically correct, this isn't it. But if you just want a nice effect going on, this will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. So each pontoon has a position and a size that can be adjusted. And just don't make sure that the radius on the pontoon isn't too small. Otherwise things just won't work there. So the last things you want to be considering here is making sure that in the blueprint, the static mesh is the root object in the component or it won't float. So the static mesh needs to be that root component. And then with this tool, less is more. So let's jump in the editor here and let's show you exactly how to set this up. So we're back in our editor here. We have a map open that has some water. You can see in the content that we have got the buoyancy blueprint if you want to go ahead and check that out. But I'm just going to right click in an empty space, create a new blueprint class. I'm going to select actor. And because we've already got BP buoyancy, let's just say we'll call this BP underscore. And then maybe we'll call this pontoon just because we're going to set the pontoon. But you can call it BP buoyancy. You can call it floating box, whatever you'd like. We generally use BP underscore for naming conventions for blueprints. So I've got my blueprint here. I'm going to use a one meter cube as my roots. So I'm going to just delete this scene root here. And I'm going to add a static mesh. So we want to go to static mesh. So add static mesh. And I'm just going to drag this static mesh over the root. And then that's what makes it the root. So I believe there's a one meter cube in here. So we've got one meter cube as our static mesh. So we're just going to select that. So our static mesh now is that one meter cube. And then we can add our buoyancy. So we want to make sure our static mesh was added first, then our buoyancy, which is here. And so the buoyancy needs to be below the static mesh. So essentially what we need to do now is just add these pontoon elements that we said before along with the radius. So radius needs to be one, two, five, as we said before. I'm going to add a couple more elements. Well, a few more elements because we want four different indexes here. So radius I'm going to keep 125. So I'm just going to copy this value, paste, paste, paste. And then P1, as I mentioned before, is going to be 50 and 50. So we will go 50 and 50. I'm just pressing tab on my keyboard there. So we've got 50, 50. The next one is going to be minus 50, minus 50. And then the next one is going to be 50 and then minus 50. And then the last one is going to be minus 50 and then 50. Again, that radius is 125. There's a whole bunch of properties here that you could dial in and look at and change. But essentially we just want to save this now, compile, and then just drag it into our map. So we've got our pontoon here and we just want to drag it in and let go. So we've got these. And let's just see if we duplicate them around and then hit, it should work in Simulate. Let's just check. So maybe I do have to play it. Let's see. Let's see. So we'll fly out here. Go to our buoyancy. So they're not buoyant at the moment. So let's take a look at that. So then back in the blueprint here, let's look at the buoyancy settings. So relative location, 50, 50. These all look good so far. Let's see. And the static mesh. Static mesh is the root, which is right. And it wasn't actually moving. So let's just, okay. So we forgot the Simulate Physics section. So let's just make sure we tick Simulate Physics there and then close it down. And then when we hit play, let's just try and simulate this just to make sure. Cause Simulate should work in this instance. Okay. So now we've got them floating. You can see that we've got some buoyancy here and then some of these are just wrongly placed. So if we simulate here, yeah. So you can play around with these settings. You can change again, the radius and the platoon properties there, dial them in however you would like. And so again, like we said, less is more with this tool for sure. You'll get some kind of buoyancy and you can dial in those properties. Again, it depends on where you drop them from as well. Like whether you have them placed in the water perfectly to begin with, whether you drop them from a height and you want them to sink down and start bouncing. But hopefully that gives you a good idea about the buoyancy tool inside of Unreal Engine.",
