  "text": " A more recent feature added to the FBIK node within Control Rig is something called subchains. Now subchains are essentially a way to limit the effect an effector has on the whole body. And you can do this by defining a smaller chain of bones within it. So for example you could create a subchain from the hand to the shoulder, which will essentially leave the rest of the body unaffected until this subchain or the hand has reached its limit and then it will engage the rest of the body to pull towards the effector. So let's take a look at a use case for that with our character. Now I'd like to show this off in a more exaggerated way. So what I've done is I've disconnected our existing logic here with the existing full body IK node and I've created a new one with a much more simple setup. So we have our right hand in here and we don't have any bone settings. We're not excluding any bones. The only thing I'm going to change is the root behaviour and set that to Pinter Input just to show this off more clearly. So when I grab this right hand here you can see that the whole body from the pelvis to the wrist is reacting to me pulling this effector around. Now when I pull the effector closer to the body you wouldn't naturally lean that way. The same as when I lift the effector up or when I lift the wrist up. You wouldn't expect the body to be reacting like this. And so this is what subchains can help you correct. So in our chain depth option here this allows us to count how many bones up the chain we would like the subchain to be. So in our case a value of 2 would give us our lower arm and then our upper arm. And the other thing that we need to change to activate subchains would be the sub iterations here inside the settings dropdown. And if we set that somewhere between 5 and 10 that should give us some pretty decent results. So if I select the effector or the hand control here you'll see that we can now move it towards the body and although it does react a small amount which is quite nice, it's no longer leaning all the way over. And we can also lift it up and move it around within its limitations without affecting the rest of the body. But as soon as we exceed those limitations you can see that we do engage the rest of the body. And they can be a quite simple setup. And if we increase this to 3 for example we'll just go slightly higher up the chain to engage the collarbone. And you probably want to set some sort of bone settings limits for this eventually but you can see that as we've added one more bone to the chain depth it's increased or it's changed which bones we're affecting. And this can really help you get some more natural poses out of your character and fix any sort of awkness that you're getting with the sort of the whole body moving when you think it shouldn't be when you're lifting a hand for example.",
