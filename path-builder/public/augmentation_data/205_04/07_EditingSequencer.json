      "concept": "Sequencer is a non-destructive, track-based editing and compositing tool within Unreal Engine. It operates on Level Sequences, which are assets containing time-based data for actors and properties. Understanding its core architecture, including tracks, sections, keyframes, and bindings, is crucial for effective cinematic creation and performance capture editing.",

      "title": "Take Recorder Data Flow",
      "concept": "Take Recorder captures data streams (animation, audio, camera) and stores them as assets. Understanding how these assets are organized and referenced within the project is essential for efficient editing and iteration. The data flow involves Live Link, animation blueprints, and potentially custom data sources.",
