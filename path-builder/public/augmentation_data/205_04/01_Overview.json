      "title": "Understanding the Role of the Asset Registry",
      "concept": "Take Recorder relies heavily on the Asset Registry to discover and manage the assets it captures. Understanding how the Asset Registry works, including its scanning process and dependency tracking, is crucial for troubleshooting issues related to missing or incorrectly referenced assets during recording.",

      "concept": "Sequencer's evaluation model determines how animation tracks are sampled and applied to actors in the scene. Understanding the order of operations (pre-roll, spawnables, tracks) and the impact of evaluation priorities is essential for achieving predictable and consistent results when editing captured data.",

      "procedural_step": "Covering what Take Recorder is",
      "why": "Take Recorder streamlines the process of capturing live performances directly into Sequencer. This is critical for iterative cinematic workflows, allowing rapid prototyping and refinement of character animation and scene blocking. It avoids manual keyframing, which is time-consuming and less nuanced.",

      "procedural_step": "Capture a vehicle performance",
      "why": "Capturing vehicle performance data using Take Recorder allows for realistic physics-based animation within Sequencer. This is important because manually animating vehicle movement often results in unnatural and unrealistic motion, especially when simulating complex interactions with the environment. This avoids hand-keyed estimations of suspension and tire behavior.",
      "antipattern_warning": "Physics Constraint Stretching: High-speed vehicle capture can expose limitations in physics constraint solvers, leading to visual artifacts. Mitigation involves adjusting constraint stiffness and damping values, and potentially using sub-stepping for increased accuracy."

      "procedural_step": "MetaHuman Layered Facial Performance Capture",
      "why": "Capturing MetaHuman facial performance with Take Recorder leverages the engine's facial animation system to create highly realistic and expressive character performances. This is important because MetaHumans have complex facial rigs that are difficult to animate manually. Using Take Recorder ensures that the captured data is accurately mapped to the MetaHuman's control rig.",

      "expected_insight": "Take Recorder captures performance data as animation tracks within Sequencer, which can be edited, blended, and layered without altering the original source data. This allows for experimentation and refinement without the risk of permanently damaging the captured performance."
