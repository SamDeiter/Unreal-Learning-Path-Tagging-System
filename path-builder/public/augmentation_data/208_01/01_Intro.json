      "title": "Understanding the IK2Bone Node's Solver",
      "concept": "The IK2Bone node uses a specific iterative solver to find the joint angles that satisfy the IK constraint. Understanding the solver's limitations (e.g., potential for popping, sensitivity to initial pose) is crucial for robust rigging.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visualization of the iterative solver process, showing how the joint angles are adjusted over time to reach the target."
