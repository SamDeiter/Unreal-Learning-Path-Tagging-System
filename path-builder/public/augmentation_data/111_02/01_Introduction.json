      "concept": "Unreal Engine's plugin system allows modular extension of the editor and runtime. Plugins encapsulate functionality, assets, and code, enabling features like the Water System to be added or removed without modifying the core engine. Understanding plugin dependencies and load order is crucial for project stability.",

Understanding how these systems divide and load landscape data is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring seamless water rendering across large environments. Incorrect setup can lead to visual artifacts or performance bottlenecks.",

The water system uses wave functions to simulate water movement, and buoyancy components to calculate how objects float and interact with the water surface. Incorrect buoyancy settings can lead to unrealistic floating behavior.",
