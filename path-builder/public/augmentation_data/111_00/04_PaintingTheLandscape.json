      "title": "Landscape Layer Blending Deep Dive",
      "concept": "The Landscape Layer Blend node leverages the Material Editor's graph-based system to define how different material layers are blended based on weight maps. Understanding the underlying math (lerping, masking) is crucial for advanced customization and performance optimization. It is also important to understand the limitations of the number of layers that can be used before performance is impacted.",

      "title": "Landscape Layer Coordinates Explained",
      "concept": "Landscape Layer Coordinates provide a UV coordinate space specifically designed for landscapes. Understanding how these coordinates interact with tiling and scaling is essential for creating seamless textures across large landscapes. Different projection modes can be used to avoid texture stretching on steep slopes.",

      "title": "Weight Blended Layers as Masks",
      "concept": "Weight-blended layers function as masks, controlling the visibility of different material layers. Understanding how these masks are stored and accessed by the material is crucial for optimizing landscape rendering performance. The engine uses these masks to determine which textures and calculations are necessary for each rendered pixel.",
