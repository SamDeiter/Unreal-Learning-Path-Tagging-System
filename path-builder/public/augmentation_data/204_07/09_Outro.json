Foliage density, material properties (e.g., subsurface scattering), and light source characteristics all affect Lumen's performance.",

      "concept": "Niagara's performance is governed by the number of particles, the complexity of the particle simulation, and the rendering cost of each particle. The checklist should emphasize the trade-offs between visual fidelity and performance. For example, complex particle interactions (collisions, forces) increase computational cost, while high particle counts increase rendering cost.",
