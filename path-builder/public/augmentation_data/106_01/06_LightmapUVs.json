      "title": "Lightmap Unwrapping Theory",
      "concept": "Lightmaps require unique UV unwrapping to avoid light bleeding and ensure accurate baked lighting. Overlapping UVs cause multiple surfaces to share the same light data, leading to incorrect illumination.",

      "why": "Unique lightmap UVs ensure that each surface receives distinct lighting information. Overlapping UVs would cause surfaces to share the same light data, leading to incorrect shadows and illumination. This is because the lightmap stores a single color value per texel in UV space.",

      "why": "The Lightmap Coordinate Index tells the engine which UV channel to use for lightmap data. If the generated lightmap UVs are on a different channel than the default, the engine will use the wrong UVs, resulting in incorrect lighting. This is a common source of light baking errors.",

      "why": "Lumen is a dynamic global illumination system. When enabled, it overrides baked lighting. Disabling Lumen within a Post-Process Volume allows the baked lighting to be visible. This is important for performance on lower-end hardware or when specific artistic control over lighting is needed.",
