Tailoring the project settings and assets to the target hardware ensures optimal performance and prevents resource exhaustion. For example, a mobile HMI application would require significantly more aggressive optimization than a desktop application."

It's important to strike a balance between performance and quality, ensuring that the HMI application remains visually appealing and informative while maintaining acceptable frame rates. Consider using Level of Detail (LOD) for materials as well."
