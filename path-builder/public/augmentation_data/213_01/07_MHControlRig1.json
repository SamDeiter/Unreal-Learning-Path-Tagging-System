      "title": "Control Rig Architecture",
      "concept": "Control Rigs in Unreal Engine 5 are assets that define a hierarchy of controls and the logic to manipulate a skeletal mesh. They use a graph-based system to define forward and inverse kinematic solvers, allowing animators to pose characters and bake animations.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of the Control Rig graph, highlighting the forward and backward solve sections, and the connection to the skeletal mesh."

      "title": "Additive Animation Layers",
      "concept": "Additive animation layers in Unreal Engine 5 allow you to blend multiple animations together, where the final pose is the sum of the base animation and the additive layer. This is useful for adding details like facial expressions or secondary motion without redoing the entire animation.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing a base animation curve and an additive animation curve being combined to produce a final animation curve."

      "title": "FK vs IK in UE5",
      "concept": "Forward Kinematics (FK) and Inverse Kinematics (IK) are two different methods for controlling skeletal meshes. FK involves rotating individual joints in a chain, while IK involves moving the end effector and having the engine calculate the joint rotations. UE5's Control Rig allows seamless switching between FK and IK for different body parts.",

      "timestamp": "1:53",
      "procedural_step": "Backwards Solve Setup",

      "procedural_step": "Bake to Animation Sequence",

      "prompt": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of baking an animation to a sequence, compared to keeping it linked to the Control Rig?",
