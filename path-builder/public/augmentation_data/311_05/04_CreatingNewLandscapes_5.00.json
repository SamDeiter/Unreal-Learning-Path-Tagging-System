      "title": "Non-Destructive Editing with Landscape Edit Layers",

      "diagram_suggestion": "A side-by-side comparison of landscapes generated from different resolution heightmaps (e.g., 512x512 vs. 2048x2048). Highlight the differences in detail and the corresponding impact on component count."

      "expected_insight": "DCC tools offer advanced sculpting and procedural generation capabilities, enabling the creation of highly detailed terrain features that are difficult to replicate manually in Unreal Engine. However, importing heightmaps can increase the complexity of the landscape material and impact rendering performance."
