      "prompt": "Why is the material, and not the texture, responsible for reflections?",
      "expected_insight": "The material defines the surface properties that dictate how light interacts with the object, including its reflectivity. Textures provide color or surface detail, but the material interprets how light bounces off those details."

      "prompt": "How does PBR differ from older shading models in Unreal Engine 5, and why is it preferred?",

      "prompt": "What happens if you set both Metallic and Roughness to 1.0? Why?",
      "expected_insight": "Setting Metallic to 1.0 makes the surface fully metallic, while Roughness at 1.0 makes it completely matte. The result would be a rough, metallic surface with very broad, diffuse reflections."

      "prompt": "Why is it important to avoid pure black or pure white in albedo maps?",
      "expected_insight": "Pure black and pure white colors don't exist in real-world surfaces. Using values close to, but not exactly, 0 or 1 provides more realistic light interaction and prevents unexpected shading artifacts."

      "expected_insight": "High-resolution textures provide more detail but consume more memory and bandwidth, potentially impacting performance. Lower-resolution textures are more efficient but may lack the necessary detail for close-up viewing. Choosing the appropriate resolution involves balancing visual quality and performance requirements."
