      "procedural_step": "Connecting Particle Color node",
      "why": "Ensures that Niagara can properly modulate the material's color and alpha based on particle data. Disconnecting it breaks the dynamic link between the particle system and the material instance, preventing real-time color adjustments and leading to a static, unresponsive visual effect.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:24",
      "procedural_step": "Using Depth Fade",
      "why": "Depth Fade creates a smooth intersection between particles and scene geometry, preventing harsh clipping artifacts. Without it, particles abruptly cut off when intersecting with surfaces, creating an unrealistic and visually jarring effect. However, excessive use can increase pixel shader cost.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },

      "timestamp": "1:42",
      "procedural_step": "Setting Blend Mode to Translucent",
      "why": "Translucency enables particles to blend with the background and other objects, creating a semi-transparent, ethereal look crucial for smoke. Opaque blend mode would render the particles as solid objects, completely obscuring anything behind them and ruining the smoke effect.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:49",
      "procedural_step": "Using Volumetric Directional Lighting",
      "why": "Volumetric Directional lighting allows the smoke to realistically interact with scene lighting, receiving shadows and contributing to the overall atmosphere. Without it, the smoke would appear flat and unlit, failing to integrate convincingly into the environment. This mode is more expensive than others.",

      "timestamp": "3:21",
      "procedural_step": "Adjusting Sub-UV settings",
      "why": "Correctly configuring the Sub-UV settings ensures that the material's animation sequence is properly mapped onto the particles. Incorrect settings lead to distorted or static textures, breaking the illusion of movement and making the smoke appear unnatural.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:41",
      "procedural_step": "Disabling Gravity Force",
      "why": "Disabling gravity allows the smoke to rise naturally due to the applied velocity, rather than being pulled downwards. Leaving gravity enabled would counteract the upward motion, causing the smoke to sink and destroying the intended effect.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "7:56",
      "procedural_step": "Adding Sub-UV Animation",
      "why": "The Sub-UV animation module drives the visual change of the smoke texture over time, creating the illusion of swirling and dissipating smoke. Without it, the smoke would appear static and lifeless, lacking the dynamic movement essential for realism.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "8:57",
      "procedural_step": "Exposing Spawn Rate as User Parameter",
      "why": "Exposing parameters allows designers to dynamically adjust the smoke's density and behavior without directly modifying the Niagara system. This promotes flexibility and reusability, enabling artists to quickly adapt the effect to different scenarios. Overuse can increase instance complexity.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:58",
      "prompt": "Why does increasing the shadow density scale enhance the visual appeal of the smoke? What are the performance trade-offs?",
      "expected_insight": "Higher shadow density creates richer, more defined shadows within the smoke volume, adding depth and realism. However, it also increases the computational cost of rendering, potentially impacting performance, especially with many overlapping particles."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:12",
      "prompt": "How would different lifetime values affect the overall appearance and performance of the smoke effect?",
      "expected_insight": "Shorter lifetimes result in more frequent particle spawning, creating denser smoke but increasing particle count and rendering cost. Longer lifetimes reduce particle count but can make the smoke appear sparse or float unrealistically."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:23",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to control the alpha channel of the smoke particles, and what visual problems can arise from neglecting it?",
      "expected_insight": "Controlling the alpha channel allows for smooth fading in and out of particles, preventing abrupt appearance and disappearance. Neglecting it can lead to jarring visual artifacts and a less realistic smoke effect."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "8:40",
      "prompt": "How does the Sub-UV animation module contribute to the realism of the smoke effect, and what alternative methods could be used to achieve a similar result?",
      "expected_insight": "Sub-UV animation adds dynamic texture changes, simulating the swirling and dissipating nature of smoke. Alternatives include using animated textures, particle motion vectors, or more complex shader-based animation techniques."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "10:17",
      "prompt": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of exposing Niagara parameters as user parameters, and what design considerations should guide the selection of parameters to expose?",
      "expected_insight": "Exposing parameters provides flexibility and reusability but can increase system complexity. Parameters should be chosen based on their impact on the visual effect and their relevance to potential use cases."
