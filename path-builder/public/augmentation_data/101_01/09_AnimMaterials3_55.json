      "procedural_step": "Using BlendAngleCorrectedNormals node.",
      "why": "This node prevents distortion when layering normal maps because it blends normals in tangent space, preserving the overall surface direction. Without it, naive blending can lead to incorrect lighting calculations and visual artifacts.",

      "timestamp": "2:47",
      "procedural_step": "Multiplying normal maps.",
      "why": "Multiplying normal maps can darken the overall normal, effectively reducing the bumpiness. This is because normal maps are centered around (0.5, 0.5, 1.0), and multiplying values less than 1 will darken the result. This can flatten the details.",

      "timestamp": "5:45",

Multiplying them emphasizes both effects, creating a stronger sense of depth. However, overdoing it can lead to unrealistic darkening.",

      "expected_insight": "Macro control offers broad adjustments, while micro control allows for fine-tuning specific details. Macro is faster for overall changes, while micro is better for isolating and refining individual effects."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:09",
      "prompt": "Why might combining AO and cavity maps through multiplication be more effective than using either map alone?",
