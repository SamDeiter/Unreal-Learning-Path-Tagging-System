  "why_annotations": [
    {
      "timestamp": "1:14",
      "procedural_step": "Production design and asset construction move ahead.",
      "why": "Because a locked story allows for efficient parallelization of asset creation, minimizing wasted effort on assets that might be cut or significantly altered later. This reduces iteration costs and accelerates overall production.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:53",
      "procedural_step": "Story development is better integrated into production.",
      "why": "Because real-time feedback loops enable directors to make informed decisions about shot composition, pacing, and character performance directly within the engine. This reduces the reliance on pre-rendered previews and facilitates a more iterative creative process.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:10",
      "procedural_step": "Sequencer now serves as the production hub.",
      "why": "Because Sequencer centralizes all aspects of shot creation, from animation and lighting to visual effects and audio. This allows for a unified workflow where changes in one area automatically propagate to others, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "6:55",
      "procedural_step": "Capture, import, and edit performances using Sequencer and Control Rig.",
      "why": "Because Sequencer provides a non-linear editing environment for animation, allowing animators to refine motion capture data, blend different takes, and add custom animation layers. Control Rig enables procedural animation and real-time manipulation of character poses, enhancing the flexibility and expressiveness of the animation.",
      "antipattern_warning": null

    {
      "timestamp": "7:30",
      "procedural_step": "Create the Control Rig's additive transform layers and start animating.",
      "why": "Because additive layers allow animators to build upon existing animation data without overwriting it, enabling iterative refinement and experimentation. This non-destructive workflow promotes creativity and reduces the risk of introducing errors.",

      "prompt": "Why does a siloed production pipeline increase the cost of revisions?",
