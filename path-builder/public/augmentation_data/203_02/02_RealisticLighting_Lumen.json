      "procedural_step": "Adjust Material Roughness to Reduce Noise",

      "timestamp": "11:52",
      "procedural_step": "Set Post Process Volume to Infinite Extent",
      "why": "Setting the post-process volume to infinite extent ensures that the post-processing effects are applied to the entire scene, regardless of camera position. Failing to do so can result in inconsistent visual quality as the camera moves.",

      "prompt": "Why might you choose baked lighting over Lumen in certain situations, even though Lumen is dynamic?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "10:57",
      "prompt": "How does material roughness affect the appearance of noise in Lumen global illumination?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "12:31",
      "prompt": "Why is Lumen considered 'trimmer' than traditional ray tracing, and what are the implications for performance?",
