    {
      "timestamp": "0:21",
      "procedural_step": "Avoid adding too many lights at once.",
      "why": "Adding too many lights simultaneously increases the computational cost of Lumen's global illumination calculations, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks and visual artifacts due to conflicting light contributions. It also makes debugging lighting issues exponentially harder.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:45",
      "procedural_step": "Disable auto exposure.",
      "why": "Disabling auto exposure provides a controlled environment for lighting design. Auto exposure constantly adjusts the scene's brightness, making it difficult to accurately gauge the impact of individual light sources and create a consistent visual style. It prevents you from seeing the 'true' light values.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:49",
      "procedural_step": "Use real-world light values (candelas/lumens).",
      "why": "Using real-world light values ensures that the lighting in the scene is physically plausible. This approach simplifies the process of achieving realistic results and facilitates collaboration with other team members who may be familiar with these units. It also allows for easier matching of real-world lighting scenarios.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:07",
      "procedural_step": "Set lights to Movable.",
      "why": "Movable lights are required to take full advantage of Lumen's dynamic global illumination and reflections. Static lights require precomputed lighting, which is not suitable for dynamic scenes. Stationary lights can provide some dynamic shadowing but still rely on baked lighting for static elements, limiting flexibility.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:04",
      "procedural_step": "Use tools to stay within value.",
      "why": "Staying within value prevents clipping and ensures that the scene's dynamic range is properly utilized. Clipping occurs when light values exceed the maximum representable value, resulting in a loss of detail and an unrealistic appearance. Overbright values also negatively impact Lumen's ability to calculate accurate global illumination.",

      "expected_insight": "Isolating light sources allows for precise control over individual light contributions, making it easier to diagnose and correct lighting issues. With Lumen, each light interacts with the scene globally, so isolating them helps to understand their specific impact on global illumination."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:10",
      "prompt": "How does disabling auto-exposure help in achieving a consistent and predictable lighting setup?",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:20",
      "prompt": "How does the post-processing volume contribute to neutralizing the scene's lighting before adding new lights?",
      "expected_insight": "The post-processing volume allows for adjustments to the scene's overall appearance, such as disabling bloom and setting a specific exposure compensation value. This ensures a consistent starting point for lighting design and prevents unwanted visual artifacts."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:22",
      "prompt": "What are the trade-offs when increasing the intensity scale of the skylight, especially when it's the only light source in the scene?",
      "expected_insight": "Increasing the intensity scale of the skylight can brighten the scene, but it can also lead to a washed-out appearance and a loss of detail. It's important to balance the intensity with other lighting elements to achieve a realistic and visually appealing result."
