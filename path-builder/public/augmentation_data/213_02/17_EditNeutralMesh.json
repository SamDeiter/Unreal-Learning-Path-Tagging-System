While convenient for editing, these wrapped LODs do not directly translate to a performance optimization strategy within UE5. The engine handles LOD switching based on screen size and distance, independent of Maya's wrap deformer.",

      "concept": "Surface joints are critical for maintaining volume and shape consistency across different LODs. When significant vertex changes are made, these joints need to be repositioned to ensure that the lower LODs accurately represent the modified shape. This is particularly important for animation and deformation within Unreal Engine 5, as incorrect joint positions can lead to visual artifacts.",
