      "title": "MetaHuman Identity Solving and LODs",
      "concept": "MetaHuman Identity solving leverages a statistical shape model (SSM) trained on a vast dataset of human faces. The 'precise match' mentioned is the engine minimizing the distance between the input mesh and the SSM. Better joint positioning across LODs is achieved by propagating the solved identity parameters (shape, skin weights) consistently during LOD generation.",

      "title": "Topology Conformance and UV Mapping",
      "concept": "Conforming to the MetaHuman template topology ensures consistent UV mapping across different MetaHumans. This is crucial for material sharing and animation retargeting. The engine relies on this consistent UV space for applying skin textures, makeup, and other surface details.",

      "title": "Delta Morph Targets and Animation",
      "concept": "The 'target delta' refers to the morph target representing the difference between the base MetaHuman mesh and the customized mesh. By minimizing this delta, the engine ensures that animations authored for the base MetaHuman transfer accurately to the customized version. Large deltas can cause animation artifacts and require manual correction.",

      "prompt": "Why is conforming to a template mesh more precise than other methods?",

      "expected_insight": "The MetaHuman identity solver will fail to produce a valid result. The resulting MetaHuman might have incorrect joint positions, broken animations, and incompatible materials due to mismatched UVs. The engine relies on consistent topology for all these systems to function correctly."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:18",
      "prompt": "How does this workflow affect the performance of animations at runtime?",
      "expected_insight": "By minimizing the geometric delta between the custom mesh and the base MetaHuman, the magnitude of morph target deformations is reduced. This translates to lower computational cost per frame, as the engine needs to perform less vertex displacement. Smaller deltas also improve the stability of the simulation, reducing the risk of visual artifacts."
