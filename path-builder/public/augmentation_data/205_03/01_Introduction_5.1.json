      "concept": "Live Link streams data as a series of 'Subjects,' each representing a distinct entity (e.g., camera, character). Understanding the underlying FFrameRate and FTimecode structures is crucial for synchronizing real-world camera data with the virtual environment. The Subject's 'MetaData' field allows for custom data transmission, enabling advanced features like lens distortion parameters.",

It leverages the Messaging system for real-time data transfer. Understanding the underlying network protocols (TCP/UDP) and serialization methods (JSON/binary) is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring reliable data delivery.",

      "concept": "Sequencer's ability to bind to Live Link sources is powered by its internal track system. Each camera cut is represented as a discrete event within the sequencer timeline. Understanding how Sequencer interpolates between camera positions and orientations is crucial for achieving smooth cinematic transitions. The Camera Cuts track determines the active camera at any given time.",

This allows for seamless integration of visual effects, animation, and other engine features directly within the editing process. It also allows for precise control over camera parameters and animation curves."
