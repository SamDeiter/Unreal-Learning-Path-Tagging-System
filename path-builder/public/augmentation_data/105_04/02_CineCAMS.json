      "title": "Cine Camera Actor Architecture",
      "concept": "The Cine Camera Actor leverages Unreal Engine's Actor-Component model. The camera's behavior is defined by its CameraComponent, while additional components can be added for custom functionality (e.g., stabilization, custom post-processing). Understanding this architecture allows for extending camera behavior through Blueprint scripting or C++.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A UML diagram showing CineCameraActor inheriting from Actor, with a CameraComponent as a primary component. Show how additional components can be attached."

      "title": "Filmback and Sensor Size",
      "concept": "The filmback settings directly influence the camera's field of view and depth of field characteristics. These settings simulate real-world camera sensors, allowing cinematographers to replicate specific looks. Understanding sensor size is crucial for achieving desired bokeh and perspective effects.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:47",
      "title": "Focus Methods and Depth of Field",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine's depth of field is a post-process effect that simulates the blurring of out-of-focus areas. The chosen focus method (Manual, Tracking, etc.) determines how the engine calculates the focal distance. Incorrect focus settings can lead to performance issues, especially with large depth of field radii.",

      "title": "Post-Process Volume Overrides",
      "concept": "Cine Camera Actors can override global post-process settings defined in PostProcessVolume actors. This allows for creating unique visual styles for individual shots. However, excessive overrides can increase rendering cost and complexity. Understanding the order of post-processing operations is crucial for optimizing performance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A flowchart showing the post-processing pipeline in Unreal Engine, highlighting the order of operations and the impact of camera-specific overrides."

      "timestamp": "3:12",

    {
      "timestamp": "3:51",
