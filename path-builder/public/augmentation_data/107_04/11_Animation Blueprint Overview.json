      "concept": "Animation Blueprints serve as the bridge between game logic and skeletal mesh animation. The RigVM (Rig Virtual Machine) within Control Rig provides a visual scripting environment for procedural animation, IK solving, and animation modification. Understanding how Animation Blueprints drive Control Rigs is crucial for advanced character and vehicle animation.",

      "concept": "The Event Graph in an Animation Blueprint handles event-driven logic (like receiving input), while the AnimGraph focuses on the continuous evaluation of animation states and blending. Separating these concerns optimizes performance and improves code maintainability. The AnimGraph uses a state machine to manage animation transitions.",

Moving computationally intensive tasks to a separate thread or optimizing the calculations can improve performance. The AnimGraph is optimized for animation-related tasks."
