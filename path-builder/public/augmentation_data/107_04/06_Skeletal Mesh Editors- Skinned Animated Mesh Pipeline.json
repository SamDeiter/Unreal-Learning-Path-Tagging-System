      "title": "Understanding the Asset Registry",
      "concept": "The Skeletal Mesh Editor relies heavily on the Asset Registry to quickly access and manage related assets like Skeletons, Materials, and Animations. The Asset Registry is a database that stores metadata about all assets in your project, enabling fast searching and filtering. Understanding how the Asset Registry works helps optimize asset management and loading times.",

      "title": "Level of Detail (LOD) System Deep Dive",
      "concept": "The LOD system automatically switches between different versions of a mesh based on its distance from the camera. This is crucial for performance optimization. Understanding the underlying algorithms that determine LOD selection (screen size, distance, etc.) allows for fine-tuning visual fidelity and performance.",

      "concept": "Blend Spaces allow you to smoothly interpolate between multiple animations based on input parameters (e.g., speed, direction). Animation State Machines define the different states an animated character can be in (e.g., idle, walking, running) and the transitions between them. Understanding how these systems work together is essential for creating realistic and responsive character animations.",
