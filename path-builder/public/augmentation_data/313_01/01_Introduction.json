      "title": "Understanding Skeletal Mesh LODs",
      "concept": "Level of Detail (LOD) in Skeletal Meshes is a crucial optimization technique. Each LOD represents a simplified version of the mesh, reducing the polygon count and complexity. The engine automatically switches between LODs based on the distance from the camera, improving rendering performance. Incorrect LOD setup can lead to visual popping or performance bottlenecks.",

      "concept": "The Metahuman Blueprint is a complex asset that manages the various components of the Metahuman, including the skeletal mesh, materials, animation, and control rig. Understanding the structure of this Blueprint is essential for customizing and extending the functionality of the Metahuman. Modifications should be done carefully to avoid breaking the existing setup.",

      "why": "Modifying the neutral pose directly affects the entire range of motion and blend shapes. Changes propagate through all animations derived from this base pose. Incorrect modifications can lead to animation artifacts and require re-targeting or re-authoring of existing animations.",

      "timestamp": "2:03",
      "procedural_step": "Merging with a custom Metahuman body",
      "why": "Seamless integration requires careful attention to bone hierarchies and skin weights. Discrepancies can cause deformation issues and require manual weight painting or re-rigging. The engine relies on consistent bone names and orientations for animation to function correctly.",
      "antipattern_warning": "Physics Constraint Stretching: Ensure that the custom body's physics asset is properly constrained to avoid unrealistic stretching during movement. This can occur if the constraints are too weak or improperly configured."

This requires careful matching of bone hierarchies and material assignments to ensure proper rendering and animation. Mismatches can lead to visual artifacts and animation errors.",

    {

      "prompt": "Why is DNA calibration essential for stylized characters like Atomic Savage?",
      "expected_insight": "DNA calibration allows for precise control over the Metahuman's shape and proportions, enabling the creation of highly stylized characters that deviate significantly from the default Metahuman appearance. It ensures that the character remains animatable and compatible with the Metahuman ecosystem."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:22",
      "prompt": "What are the potential performance implications of using high-resolution head LODs?",
      "expected_insight": "Using overly detailed head LODs, especially at a distance, can significantly impact rendering performance. The engine has to process a large number of polygons even when the character is small on screen, leading to frame rate drops. Proper LOD configuration is essential for maintaining performance."

      "prompt": "How do RBF solvers contribute to the final look and feel of the customized Metahuman?",
      "expected_insight": "RBF solvers (Radial Basis Function) are used to drive corrective blendshapes, which refine the character's deformations and add subtle details. They help to smooth out wrinkles, correct joint rotations, and enhance the overall realism of the character's movements."
