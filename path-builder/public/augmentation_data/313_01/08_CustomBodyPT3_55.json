      "title": "DNA Calibration and Skin Weight Influence",
      "concept": "The Metahuman DNA system uses a parametric model to represent facial and body features. Skin weights, which determine how much a bone influences a vertex, must align with the DNA's constraints to prevent deformation artifacts. The DNA description acts as a schema, defining allowable skin weight influences.",

      "concept": "Transferring skin weights between meshes is crucial for maintaining deformation fidelity when working with modular character assets. The 'Copy Skin Weights' tool leverages proximity-based algorithms to map influences. Understanding the underlying data structures of skeletal meshes (vertex buffers, influence arrays) is key to optimizing this process.",

      "title": "Neck Falloff Weight Blend Mask and DNA Modification",
      "concept": "The neck falloff weight blend mask is a texture used to smoothly transition skin weight influences between the head and body. This mask is applied during the DNA modification process to ensure a seamless blend. Modifying the DNA directly impacts the character's animation and deformation behavior within the engine.",

      "why": "Copying skin weights ensures that the final body mesh used in Unreal Engine has the corrected skinning data. Without this step, the separated body mesh would exhibit the original skinning errors, leading to visual artifacts and animation inconsistencies in the engine.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:43",
      "prompt": "Why is it necessary to transfer skin weights to the separated body mesh *before* exporting to Unreal Engine?",
      "expected_insight": "The separated body mesh is the asset that will be imported into Unreal Engine. If the skin weights are not transferred, the engine will use the original, uncorrected skin weights, resulting in the same visual errors that the validation step was designed to prevent."
