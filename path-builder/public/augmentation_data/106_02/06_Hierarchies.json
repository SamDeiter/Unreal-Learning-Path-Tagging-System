      "title": "Datasmith Scene Hierarchy Construction",
      "concept": "Datasmith constructs Unreal Engine Actors and Components based on the scene graph of the source DCC. Understanding how Datasmith interprets different DCC scene graph elements (layers, groups, blocks) is crucial for predictable asset import and runtime performance. Datasmith uses metadata to preserve relationships.",

      "title": "Static Mesh Instancing in Unreal Engine",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine leverages instancing to optimize rendering performance. When Datasmith detects identical mesh definitions across multiple Actors (e.g., instances in 3ds Max, components in SketchUp, families in Revit, blocks in Rhino), it creates a single Static Mesh asset and uses Instanced Static Mesh Components (ISMCs) to render multiple copies. This reduces memory footprint and draw calls.",

      "title": "Actor Pivot Points and World Origin",
      "concept": "The location of an Actor's pivot point relative to the world origin significantly impacts transformations (translation, rotation, scale) and rendering performance. If pivot points are far from the object's geometry or the world origin, floating-point precision errors can accumulate, leading to visual artifacts and instability. Datasmith attempts to preserve pivot point locations from the DCC, but manual adjustment within Unreal Engine may be necessary.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual comparison of an object with a pivot point at its center versus one with a pivot point far away, illustrating the effect on rotation and potential for floating-point errors."

      "prompt": "Why does Unreal Engine treat families in Revit as instance geometry?",
