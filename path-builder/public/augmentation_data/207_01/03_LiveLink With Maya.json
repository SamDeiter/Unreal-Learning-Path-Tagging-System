    {
      "timestamp": "0:17",
      "procedural_step": "Preview in real-time",
      "why": "Real-time preview eliminates iterative export/import cycles, accelerating the animation review process and enabling immediate feedback on aesthetic choices within the Unreal Engine environment. This reduces artist downtime and allows for more creative exploration.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:54",
      "procedural_step": "Data goes through Unreal Message Bus",
      "why": "The Unreal Message Bus provides a low-latency communication channel optimized for real-time data streaming. This ensures minimal delay between animation changes in Maya and their reflection in Unreal Engine, crucial for interactive workflows and virtual production scenarios. Without it, you'd have to manually serialize and deserialize data, which is slow and error-prone.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:05",
      "procedural_step": "Skeletal animation component gives access to OnLiveLinkUpdated event",
      "why": "The OnLiveLinkUpdated event is triggered specifically when new Live Link data is received. This avoids unnecessary animation updates on every frame (as would occur with the Tick event), improving performance, especially with complex skeletal meshes and numerous Live Link subjects. Over-reliance on Tick can lead to performance bottlenecks.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:45",
      "procedural_step": "Check 'Use less CPU when in background' option",
      "why": "Disabling 'Use less CPU when in background' ensures that Unreal Engine continues to process Live Link data even when the application is not in focus. This is essential for maintaining a continuous real-time preview of the animation, preventing interruptions and ensuring a seamless workflow. Leaving it enabled will halt Live Link updates, breaking the real-time connection.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:45",
      "procedural_step": "Enable Camera Sync",
      "why": "Enabling Camera Sync streamlines virtual production workflows by allowing the camera position and orientation in Maya to directly control the camera in Unreal Engine. This facilitates real-time camera blocking and previs, enabling directors and cinematographers to visualize shots within the final rendering environment. Without it, manual camera matching is required, which is time-consuming and inaccurate.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:10",
      "prompt": "Why does Live Link differentiate between 'sources' and 'subjects'?",
      "expected_insight": "Sources represent the external applications providing data, while subjects are the specific data streams within those applications. This allows Unreal to manage multiple connections and selectively process animation data for different characters or objects."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:28",
      "prompt": "How could you use Live Link to drive parameters other than skeletal animation?",
      "expected_insight": "Live Link can stream arbitrary data, such as curve data or metadata, which can be used to control material parameters, particle effects, or other dynamic elements in Unreal Engine, enabling complex real-time visual effects."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:55",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to select both the mesh and the root bone when adding a subject in Maya?",
      "expected_insight": "The mesh provides the visual representation, while the root bone establishes the coordinate space and hierarchical structure for the animation data. Without both, the animation may be misaligned or incomplete in Unreal Engine."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:40",
      "prompt": "What are the potential drawbacks of disabling 'Use less CPU when in background'?",
      "expected_insight": "Disabling this option may increase CPU usage and power consumption, potentially impacting performance on lower-end systems or shortening battery life on laptops. It's a trade-off between real-time preview and system resource utilization."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:30",
      "prompt": "Why is it necessary to match the Live Link subject name in Unreal to the character name in Maya?",
      "expected_insight": "The subject name acts as a unique identifier, allowing Unreal Engine to correctly map the incoming animation data to the corresponding skeletal mesh. Mismatched names will result in the animation not being applied to the intended character."
