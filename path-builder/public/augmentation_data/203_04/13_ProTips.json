      "why": "Console variables provide a mechanism to override default engine settings without recompilation. This allows for runtime adjustments to optimize performance or visual quality based on specific hardware or scene requirements. Incorrectly configured CVars can lead to suboptimal rendering or instability.",

      "why": "VDB files are used because they efficiently represent sparse volumetric data, reducing memory footprint and improving rendering performance compared to dense volume representations. The Path Tracer's native support allows for physically accurate lighting and shadowing of these volumes.",

      "expected_insight": "Path Tracers calculate light transport through the volume, resulting in more realistic lighting and shadows. Rasterization often uses approximations that are faster but less accurate. Path tracing is more computationally expensive but yields higher visual fidelity."

      "expected_insight": "The Sequencer's tick rate determines how frequently the scene is updated. If the tick rate is too low relative to the temporal sample count, motion blur may be inaccurate or exhibit stepping artifacts, as the scene isn't being sampled frequently enough to capture the full range of motion."
