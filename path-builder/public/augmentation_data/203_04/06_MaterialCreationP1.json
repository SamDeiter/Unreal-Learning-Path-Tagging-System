      "concept": "The 'Thin Translucent' shading model is specifically designed for single-surface translucent materials in the Path Tracer. It simplifies light transport calculations by assuming light only interacts with a single surface, improving performance and accuracy for this specific case. Understanding the limitations of other shading models with path tracing is crucial for optimization.",

      "concept": "The Index of Refraction (IOR) determines how much light bends when entering a material. Higher IOR values result in more pronounced refraction effects. This property is crucial for realistically simulating transparent and translucent materials in the Path Tracer. The 'refraction mode' setting controls how refraction is calculated.",
