## Recommendations for LMS Integration

When your LMS analytics become available, replace these estimates with:

1. **Course Enrollment Velocity** - Which topics have fastest-growing enrollment
2. **Completion Rates** - Which topics learners finish vs. abandon
3. **Search Queries** - What learners are searching for but not finding
4. **Prerequisite Chain Performance** - Which paths lead to highest completion
5. **Time-to-Competency** - Which skills take longest to master

## Notes

- Demand estimates are relative percentages (0-100) for visualization purposes
- Data should be refreshed quarterly as market conditions evolve
- Epic's State of Unreal (annual GDC) provides best official roadmap updates
