      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:46",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to clamp the slope value between 0 and 1 before using it as a blend factor?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:50",
      "prompt": "How does breaking material attributes contribute to optimization within the material editor?",
      "expected_insight": "Breaking material attributes allows you to selectively use only the necessary attributes from a material layer, reducing the computational overhead of processing unused data. This can significantly improve material performance, especially in complex material setups."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:40",
      "prompt": "What are the limitations of using World Aligned Blend for extremely complex or concave surfaces?",
      "expected_insight": "World Aligned Blend relies on world-space normals, which can produce undesirable blending artifacts on highly complex or concave surfaces where the normal direction changes rapidly. Alternative blending techniques might be necessary in such cases."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:05",
      "prompt": "How would the material change if the order of the layers was reversed (grass, dirt, rock)?",
      "expected_insight": "Reversing the order would create an unnatural effect where grass appears on steep slopes and rock on flat surfaces, contradicting real-world geological processes. This would significantly reduce the believability of the landscape material."
