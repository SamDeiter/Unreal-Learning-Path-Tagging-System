      "prompt": "Why is the Game Camera Actor unsuitable for cinematic sequences?",

      "prompt": "How does the diaphragm blade count affect the bokeh of an out-of-focus area?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:38",
      "prompt": "Why would you choose Cine Capture Component 2D over Scene Capture Component 2D?",

      "prompt": "How does changing the camera sensor size affect the resulting image?",
      "expected_insight": "Altering the sensor size changes the field of view and depth of field. A larger sensor generally results in a shallower depth of field and a wider field of view for the same focal length."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:08",
      "prompt": "Why does a lower aperture number result in a shallower depth of field?",
      "expected_insight": "A lower aperture number (e.g., f/1.4) corresponds to a wider lens opening, allowing more light to enter the camera. This reduces the depth of field, creating a more pronounced separation between the subject and the background."
