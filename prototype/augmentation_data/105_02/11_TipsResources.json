      "title": "World Partitioning vs. Levels",
      "concept": "Explain the fundamental difference between World Partition and traditional level streaming. World Partition dynamically loads and unloads world data based on player proximity, enabling massive open worlds. Levels require manual management and are better suited for smaller, discrete environments.",

      "concept": "Clarify that Level Sequences are data assets that store animation, camera cuts, and other cinematic data. They are not just containers, but self-contained blueprints for orchestrating scene elements over time. This allows for non-destructive editing and easy reuse.",

      "timestamp": "2:41",
      "procedural_step": "Sub-scene tracks are powerful organizational tools.",
      "why": "Sub-scene tracks promote modularity and reusability. By encapsulating animation, effects, or lighting into separate level sequences, you can easily reuse these elements across multiple shots or even different projects, reducing redundancy and improving workflow efficiency.",
