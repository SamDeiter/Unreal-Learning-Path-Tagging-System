      "why": "This is because MetaHumans provide a standardized, pre-rigged character asset pipeline, reducing the need for custom character creation pipelines and specialized technical artists. This lowers the barrier to entry for high-fidelity character integration.",

      "why": "Each of these assets contributes to the overall realism and performance of the MetaHuman. For example, the 'MetaHuman DNA' asset contains blend shape data that allows for realistic facial expressions and lip syncing. The Control Rig enables animators to pose and animate the character intuitively.",
