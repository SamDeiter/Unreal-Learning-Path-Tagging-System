      "title": "Influence of Lighting on Feature Tracking",
      "concept": "The Metahuman Identity Solver relies on image analysis. Lighting changes the pixel data, thus altering the solver's interpretation of facial features. This is because the solver uses edge detection and feature extraction algorithms that are sensitive to contrast and shadow.",

      "title": "Albedo Texture and Feature Detection",
      "concept": "The albedo texture provides crucial color and intensity information that aids the tracking markers in identifying and shaping facial features. Without it, the solver relies solely on geometry, which can be less precise, especially in areas with subtle curves like eyebrows.",

      "concept": "The initial tracking marker placement is performed on a 2D image. The Metahuman Identity Solver then projects these 2D positions onto the 3D geometry of the Metahuman template. This projection introduces potential inaccuracies, especially if the 2D marker placement is not precise.",

      "prompt": "Why is careful framing of the face so important before promoting a neutral pose frame?",
      "expected_insight": "The framing directly impacts the initial 2D representation of the face, which the solver uses as a reference. Poor framing can lead to inaccurate feature detection and a suboptimal solve."

      "prompt": "Why is it sometimes necessary to manually adjust tracking markers, even when the automatic tracking seems reasonable?",

      "prompt": "Why is it important to compare the solved mesh with the template mesh, and what are you looking for in this comparison?",

      "prompt": "Why does moving the tracking markers even a little bit sometimes fix errors?",
      "expected_insight": "The solver is an iterative system. Even small changes to the input can cause the solver to converge on a different, and potentially more accurate, solution. It's like nudging a complex system towards a more stable state."
