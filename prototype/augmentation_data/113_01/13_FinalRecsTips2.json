      "title": "Actor Component Hierarchy",
      "concept": "Understanding the Actor-Component relationship is fundamental. Actors are containers; Components provide functionality (static mesh, skeletal mesh, etc.). Parenting the Metahuman Blueprint to an Actor centralizes transform control and avoids accidental individual component manipulation.",

      "concept": "Unreal Engine versions introduce significant changes to core systems like the Rendering pipeline (Lumen, Nanite), Animation (Control Rig), and Physics. Metahumans leverage these systems, so engine version dictates available features and compatibility.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A timeline showing Unreal Engine versions (e.g., 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5), highlighting key feature additions relevant to Metahumans (e.g., improved Control Rig, enhanced Lumen support)."

      "concept": "The Mesh to Metahuman process leverages a statistical model trained on a vast dataset of human faces. It projects your input mesh onto this statistical space, finding the closest match and generating a compatible Metahuman DNA asset. This DNA asset drives the blend shapes and rig controls.",

      "timestamp": "1:15",
      "procedural_step": "Parent Metahuman to Actor.",
      "why": "Parenting ensures the Metahuman's relative transform is maintained. Without parenting, the Metahuman's animation may fight against the level's transform, causing it to revert to its default pose during movement.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:47",
      "procedural_step": "Metahumans can only be upgraded.",
      "why": "Upgrading is possible because new versions often add features or refine existing skeletal structures. Downgrading is not supported due to potential incompatibilities with older skeletal joint systems or blueprint setups.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:09",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to zero out the position of both the Actor and the Metahuman before parenting?",
      "expected_insight": "Zeroing out the transforms establishes a clear relative position. If the Metahuman has a non-zero local transform *before* parenting, moving the Actor will result in an offset equal to the Metahuman's pre-existing local transform. This can lead to unexpected placement issues."

      "prompt": "Why does using a conformed mesh (same topology) in the Mesh to Metahuman workflow result in better fitting geometry, especially in joints?",
      "expected_insight": "Consistent topology ensures that the statistical model used by Mesh to Metahuman can accurately map the input mesh's vertices to the Metahuman's skeletal structure. This leads to more precise deformation and reduces artifacts in joint areas."
