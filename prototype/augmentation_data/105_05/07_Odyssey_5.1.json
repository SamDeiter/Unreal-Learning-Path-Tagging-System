    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:47",
      "prompt": "Why is a 'debug stamp' necessary before creating complex brushes?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:24",
      "prompt": "Why are the texture dimensions set to 1920x1080?",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:06",
      "prompt": "Why is it important that the brush is an 'Unreal Asset'?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:07",
      "prompt": "What are the potential consequences of skipping the debug stamp step?",
      "expected_insight": "Skipping the debug stamp could lead to wasted time debugging complex brush setups when the underlying issue is a simple configuration problem with the tablet or plugin. It's a form of premature optimization that increases debugging complexity."
