      "concept": "The Derived Data Cache (DDC) is a critical subsystem that pre-computes and stores intermediate assets in various formats optimized for different platforms and hardware. Understanding its structure (Local, Shared, Global) and invalidation rules is crucial for efficient iteration and deployment. Incorrect DDC setup leads to shader recompilation delays and inconsistent behavior across machines.",

Understanding the Unreal Engine's profiling tools (e.g., Unreal Insights, Stat commands) allows you to pinpoint areas where performance can be improved. Ignoring profiling can lead to inefficient resource usage and poor performance.",

Static lights are the most performant but offer no dynamic lighting, while movable lights are the most flexible but also the most expensive."
