Understanding which variables affect specific aspects (e.g., anti-aliasing, shadow quality, global illumination) allows for targeted optimization and debugging of visual artifacts. Incorrect settings can lead to performance bottlenecks or visual inconsistencies.",

This prevents color bleeding and allows for accurate layering of visual effects behind the hair. Without this separation, compositing becomes significantly more difficult and prone to artifacts.",

Console variables allow you to tune the rendering pipeline to match the specific demands of each situation, optimizing for both visual quality and performance."

      "explanation": "More complex grooms have a higher polygon count and require more calculations for rendering, which can significantly impact performance, especially in real-time scenarios."

      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's global illumination and reflections system. If you are not using Lumen, console variables related to it will have no effect. Ray Tracing is an alternative to Lumen, so you would need to adjust console variables related to Ray Tracing instead."

      "question": "Why is understanding LODs important when working with Metahumans in Unreal Engine 5?",
