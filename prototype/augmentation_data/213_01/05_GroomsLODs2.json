      "title": "Skeletal Mesh LOD Selection",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine 5's skeletal mesh component uses a Level of Detail (LOD) system to reduce rendering complexity for distant or less important objects. Each LOD represents a simplified version of the mesh, with fewer polygons and potentially simpler materials. The engine automatically selects the appropriate LOD based on screen size, distance from the camera, and other factors, balancing visual quality and performance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing a skeletal mesh with multiple LODs, transitioning from high-poly to low-poly as distance increases. Include performance metrics (triangle count, vertex count) for each LOD."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:15",
      "title": "Animation Feature Evaluation per LOD",
      "concept": "The MetaHuman component in UE5 allows fine-grained control over which animation features (correctives, control rigs, rigid body simulations) are evaluated at each LOD. This is crucial for optimizing performance, as complex animation calculations can be disabled for lower LODs without significantly impacting visual quality at a distance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A table illustrating which animation features are enabled/disabled for each LOD level, and the corresponding performance impact (CPU cost, memory usage)."

    {
      "timestamp": "1:16",
      "procedural_step": "The LOD sync component manages LODs across Metahuman components.",
      "why": "This ensures visual consistency. Without synchronization, the face might be high-detail while the body is low-detail, creating a jarring visual artifact. This component centralizes LOD management, preventing manual, error-prone adjustments across multiple components.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:15",
      "procedural_step": "The Metahuman component allows turning on/off animation features per LOD.",
      "why": "This is a performance optimization. Evaluating complex animation features (like cloth simulation or muscle correctives) on distant LODs provides negligible visual benefit but consumes significant resources. Disabling these features on lower LODs improves frame rates without a noticeable quality loss.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:26",
      "procedural_step": "Correctives preserve skin volume.",
      "why": "Correctives use post-process animation calculations to preserve realistic volume and shape during deformations. Without them, joints can collapse unrealistically, especially during extreme poses. However, these calculations are computationally expensive, impacting performance, especially on mobile or lower-end hardware.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "6:36",
      "procedural_step": "Setting face animation LOD threshold to -1 disables LODing.",
      "why": "Setting the threshold to -1 forces the highest quality rig logic to always be evaluated, regardless of distance. This maximizes visual fidelity but incurs the highest performance cost. This setting is useful for cinematics or close-up shots where visual quality is paramount, but detrimental for real-time gameplay.",

      "prompt": "Why is it important to have a 'maximum number of LODs' setting? What problems might arise if this value was uncapped?",
      "expected_insight": "An uncapped LOD count could lead to excessive memory usage and increased content creation overhead. Each LOD level consumes memory, and an unnecessarily high number of LODs could bloat the project size and impact runtime performance. Limiting the LOD count provides a balance between visual fidelity and resource management."

      "prompt": "Imagine a character wearing a complex physics-driven cloak. How would you use the 'rigid body LOD threshold' to optimize performance without sacrificing visual quality?",
      "expected_insight": "I would set the 'rigid body LOD threshold' to a lower value (e.g., 1 or 2). This would disable physics simulation for the cloak on distant LODs, where the detailed movement is less noticeable. The character would still benefit from physics simulation when close to the camera, but the performance cost would be reduced when the character is further away."

    {
      "timestamp": "4:35",

      "severity": "MEDIUM",
