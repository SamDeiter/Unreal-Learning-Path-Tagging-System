      "timestamp": "2:17",
      "procedural_step": "Setting the maximum speed value.",
      "why": "The maximum speed value defines the upper bound of the Blend Space's input range. Incorrect values will either clamp the animation at lower speeds or cause extrapolation beyond the intended range, leading to unnatural movements. This affects the perceived responsiveness of the character.",

      "timestamp": "3:06",

      "why": "2D Blend Spaces allow for more complex animation blending based on two input parameters. This enables nuanced control over character movement, but also increases the computational cost of animation updates. Overuse can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with many characters on screen.",
