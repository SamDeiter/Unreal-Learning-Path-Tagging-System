    {
      "timestamp": "0:31",

      "timestamp": "1:01",
      "procedural_step": "Tool strength controls the intensity of the brush.",
      "why": "Tool strength scales the delta applied to the heightmap values per brush stroke. Higher values lead to faster, but potentially less controlled, landscape modification, increasing the risk of artifacts.",

      "timestamp": "1:39",
      "procedural_step": "Brush falloff controls the shape of the brush.",
      "why": "Brush falloff defines the interpolation curve used to blend the brush's effect from its center to its edge. A smoother falloff avoids harsh transitions in the heightmap, preventing visual artifacts and improving the realism of the sculpted terrain.",

    {
      "timestamp": "5:00",
      "procedural_step": "Avoid smoothing everything at once.",
      "why": "Aggressive smoothing can flatten the landscape and remove desired features. It also reduces geometric variation, potentially leading to less efficient Nanite tessellation and a less visually interesting result. Furthermore, over-smoothing can negatively impact material blending, creating uniform and unrealistic textures.",

      "procedural_step": "Erosion should be applied from top down.",
      "why": "Simulating erosion from the top down mimics natural water flow and sediment deposition. This creates more realistic erosion patterns and avoids unnatural artifacts that can occur when applying erosion randomly or from the bottom up. This approach also influences how materials blend, creating realistic sediment trails.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:26",
      "prompt": "How does brush size affect the performance of landscape sculpting, considering Nanite?",
      "expected_insight": "Larger brush sizes modify larger areas of the heightmap at once, potentially increasing the computational cost. However, Nanite's dynamic tessellation can mitigate this by only adding detail where needed, making brush size less of a direct performance bottleneck than overall landscape complexity."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:34",
      "prompt": "Why is the 'clay brush' effective for creating mountain-like structures?",
      "expected_insight": "The clay brush adds volume in a more uniform and additive manner, mimicking the way mountains are formed through geological processes. This helps to create a more natural and believable mountain shape compared to simply raising the terrain with the standard sculpt tool."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:48",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to smooth the landscape before applying erosion?",
      "expected_insight": "Smoothing helps to remove sharp edges and artifacts that can negatively impact the erosion simulation. It creates a more even surface for the erosion tools to work with, resulting in more realistic and visually appealing erosion patterns."

Together, they create a cohesive and believable environment."
