      "prompt": "Why does the renamed asset disappear from its original location in the Content Browser? What underlying mechanism causes this behavior, and how could you prevent it?",
      "expected_insight": "The Content Browser sorts assets alphabetically. Renaming changes the asset's name, causing it to be re-sorted. Preventing this would require custom sorting logic or a different naming scheme."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:55",
      "prompt": "Why does setting the 'Supported Class' to 'Material' prevent the tool from appearing on other asset types? What are the implications of using a base class (like UObject) versus a specific class (like Material)?",
      "expected_insight": "The filtering mechanism checks the class hierarchy. Only assets of the specified class or its children will display the tool. Using a base class would make the tool appear on a wider range of assets, potentially leading to unintended consequences."
