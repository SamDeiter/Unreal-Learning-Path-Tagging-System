      "title": "Transform Spaces: World vs. Local",
      "concept": "Understanding the difference between world space and local space is crucial for predictable object manipulation. World space is the absolute coordinate system of the level. Local space is relative to the object's parent. Transformations in local space are applied relative to the object's current orientation and position.",

Understanding how to toggle visibility of elements like collision, navigation, and post-processing volumes is essential for efficient workflow.",

      "timestamp": "2:56",
      "procedural_step": "Toggling through different view modes for optimization.",
