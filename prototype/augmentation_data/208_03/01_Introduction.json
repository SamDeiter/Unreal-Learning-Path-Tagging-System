      "title": "Skeletal Mesh Bone Orientation & Control Rig Transforms",
      "concept": "Control Rigs manipulate the transforms of bones within a Skeletal Mesh. Understanding the initial bone orientations (roll, pitch, yaw) in the mesh is critical because Control Rig operations are performed relative to these local spaces. Incorrect initial orientations can lead to gimbal lock or unintuitive control behavior.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing a Skeletal Mesh bone with its local coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) visualized, and how rotations applied in world space are converted to local rotations within the Control Rig."

      "title": "Skinning Weights and Control Rig Influence",
      "concept": "Skinning weights determine how much each bone influences a vertex on the mesh. When using Control Rigs, it's crucial to understand how skinning interacts with the rig's transformations. Poor skinning can lead to visual artifacts even with a perfectly designed Control Rig.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of skinning weights, showing how different bones contribute to the final position of a vertex, and how Control Rig transformations affect this weighting."

      "title": "Control Rig Execution Order and Dependency Graph",
      "concept": "Control Rigs operate within a dependency graph, where the order of execution of different nodes is crucial. Understanding this order is essential for creating rigs that behave predictably and avoid circular dependencies. Incorrect execution order can lead to unexpected animation results.",

      "procedural_step": "Considering bone orientations and hierarchies.",
      "why": "Incorrect bone orientations will cause gimbal lock issues when rotating bones using the Control Rig. This is because rotations are applied in local space, relative to the bone's initial orientation. Hierarchies affect how transformations propagate; changes to a parent bone affect its children.",

      "timestamp": "0:32",
      "procedural_step": "Thoughts about skinning meshes.",
      "why": "Poor skinning can lead to visual artifacts even with a well-designed Control Rig. Vertices not properly weighted to the correct bones will not deform correctly when the Control Rig manipulates those bones, leading to stretching or tearing.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:43",
      "procedural_step": "Setting up controls for mechanical accuracy.",
      "why": "Mechanical accuracy requires precise control over bone transformations. Using appropriate control types (e.g., rotation limits, IK solvers) ensures that the rig behaves according to mechanical constraints. Neglecting this will result in unrealistic or physically impossible movements.",
