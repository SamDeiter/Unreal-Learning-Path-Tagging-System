      "concept": "The DNA calibration script leverages Unreal Engine's skeletal mesh and morph target systems. Detail transfer relies on proximity-based algorithms to map high-resolution sculpted details onto the Metahuman's morph targets. Understanding the limitations of these algorithms is crucial for managing detail loss and artifacts.",
