      "title": "Skeletal Mesh Re-import Process",
      "concept": "Re-importing a Skeletal Mesh involves updating the underlying vertex data and potentially the skeleton hierarchy. This process leverages the Asset Import Pipeline, which handles data conversion and resource creation. Understanding the pipeline's stages (e.g., mesh processing, material assignment, LOD generation) is crucial for troubleshooting import issues.",

      "title": "FBX Import Options and Skeleton Assignment",
      "concept": "The FBX import options directly influence how the engine interprets the incoming mesh data. Assigning the correct skeleton is critical for animation compatibility. The engine uses the skeleton to map bone influences to vertices, ensuring that the mesh deforms correctly during animation. Incorrect skeleton assignment leads to animation artifacts.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram showing the relationship between the FBX file, the import options, the assigned skeleton, and the resulting Skeletal Mesh asset in Unreal Engine."

      "title": "MetaHuman DNA and Facial Animation",
      "concept": "MetaHuman DNA files contain blend shape data that drives facial animation. The engine uses this data to deform the face mesh based on animation inputs. The DNA file must be compatible with the Skeletal Mesh to ensure correct expression and lip-sync. Incompatibilities lead to distorted or broken facial animations.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A visual representation of how the MetaHuman DNA file interacts with the Skeletal Mesh to drive facial animation, highlighting the role of blend shapes and animation curves."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "11:46",
      "title": "Skeletal Alignment and Custom Body Assignment",
      "concept": "When using custom bodies, ensuring skeletal alignment is paramount. The engine relies on a consistent bone hierarchy and orientation for animation to function correctly. Misalignment leads to joint popping, stretching, and other visual artifacts. The engine's animation retargeting system can help mitigate these issues, but proper initial alignment is essential.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A side-by-side comparison of the original and custom skeletons, highlighting potential areas of misalignment and how to correct them using the Persona editor."

      "timestamp": "2:15",
      "procedural_step": "Assign a source file path",
      "why": "Setting the source file path tells the engine where to find the updated mesh data for re-import. Without this, the engine uses cached data, preventing updates from being applied. This ensures the re-import process uses the latest FBX file.",

      "procedural_step": "Change import rotation to 90 degrees",
      "why": "The engine's default coordinate system may differ from the FBX's. Rotating the mesh during import aligns it with the engine's coordinate system, preventing orientation issues and animation glitches. Incorrect orientation can lead to skewed animations and incorrect physics interactions.",

    },

      "timestamp": "10:03",
      "procedural_step": "Re-bind all of the grooms",
      "why": "Grooms (hair, eyelashes, etc.) are bound to specific skeletal meshes. Updating the head mesh requires re-binding the grooms to ensure they follow the new mesh's deformation. Failure to re-bind results in detached or misaligned grooms, breaking the character's visual integrity.",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:10",
      "prompt": "Why does the head LOD look strange after importing?",
      "expected_insight": "The head LOD looks strange because the DNA file hasn't been updated yet. The mesh has changed, but the animation data (blend shapes) is still based on the old mesh. This mismatch causes visual distortions."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:50",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "11:34",
      "prompt": "Why does the neck region look incorrect even after re-binding the grooms?",
      "expected_insight": "The neck region looks incorrect because the head and body skeletons are misaligned. The head's joint positions are constrained to the original body, which no longer matches the updated head mesh. This misalignment causes a visible seam or distortion in the neck area."
