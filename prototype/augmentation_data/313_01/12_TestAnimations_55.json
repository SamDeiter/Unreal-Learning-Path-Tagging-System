      "concept": "The IK Retargeter in Unreal Engine 5 remaps animation data between skeletons with different proportions and bone structures. It leverages inverse kinematics solvers to ensure that the motion remains natural and consistent, even when transferring animations between characters with varying limb lengths or joint orientations. Understanding the underlying IK constraints and solver settings is crucial for achieving high-quality retargeting results.",

      "concept": "Animation Retargeting Options in Unreal Engine 5 control how animation data is translated from a source skeleton to a target skeleton. Setting the 'pelvis' to 'Animation Scaled' allows the overall scale of the animation to be adjusted based on the relative size of the skeletons. Setting 'main joints' to 'Skeleton' ensures that the joint orientations are aligned with the target skeleton's rest pose, preserving the character's unique shape and posture.",

      "why": "Intersections indicate potential issues with the skeletal mesh's weighting or the animation's range of motion. This can lead to visual artifacts and break the illusion of a realistic character. The engine renders these overlapping surfaces, causing z-fighting and visual noise.",

      "procedural_step": "Seeing incorrect shoulder and neck region deformation.",
      "why": "Deformation issues arise from mismatched bone lengths or incorrect skin weights during the rigging process. The engine interpolates vertex positions based on bone influence, and errors in this setup lead to unnatural bending and stretching. This can be mitigated by corrective blend shapes or better skinning.",

      "why": "Retargeting animations between skeletons with different proportions requires careful adjustment of bone retargeting options. Without proper scaling and alignment, the animation will appear distorted or unnatural. The engine relies on bone hierarchies and transforms to drive the mesh deformation, and inconsistencies in these structures lead to visual errors.",

      "why": "Setting the pelvis to 'Animation Scaled' allows the animation to adapt to the overall scale difference between the source and target skeletons. This prevents the character from appearing too large or too small relative to the environment. The engine uses the pelvis as the root bone for animation, and scaling it ensures that the entire animation is proportionally adjusted.",

      "why": "Setting the main joints to 'Skeleton' aligns the joint orientations with the target skeleton's rest pose. This preserves the character's unique shape and prevents the animation from distorting the character's silhouette. The engine uses joint orientations to calculate bone transformations, and aligning them with the skeleton ensures that the animation is applied correctly.",
