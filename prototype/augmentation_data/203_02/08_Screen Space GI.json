      "title": "Understanding Global Illumination Methods",
      "concept": "Differentiate between Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI), Lumen Global Illumination, and Ray Traced Global Illumination in terms of their underlying algorithms, performance characteristics, and suitability for different types of scenes (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor, static vs. dynamic lighting).",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A comparison table outlining the pros and cons of each GI method, including performance cost, accuracy, and supported features (e.g., reflections, refractions)."

      "title": "Ray Tracing Pipeline Integration",
      "concept": "Explain how SSGI interacts with the ray tracing pipeline when both are enabled. Clarify the order of operations (e.g., which calculations are performed in screen space vs. ray traced) and how this affects the final image quality and performance.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A flowchart illustrating the data flow between SSGI and the ray tracing pipeline, highlighting which components contribute to the final global illumination effect."

      "timestamp": "0:34",
      "procedural_step": "Set baked lighting before SSGI",
      "why": "SSGI in this context is designed to *complement* baked lighting, not replace it. Baking first establishes a baseline of static lighting, allowing SSGI to then add dynamic, screen-dependent GI effects on top. Changing baked lighting later invalidates the SSGI contribution.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "1:55",
      "procedural_step": "Override GI method in Post Process Volume",
      "why": "Post Process Volumes provide localized control over rendering features. Overriding the project-level GI setting allows for artistic control within specific areas of the level, enabling effects like localized lighting enhancements or stylistic variations. This is crucial for performance optimization in specific areas of the scene.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:34",
      "procedural_step": "Switch from Ray Tracing GI to SSGI",
      "why": "Switching to SSGI from ray tracing GI can significantly reduce rendering cost, especially in scenes with complex geometry or numerous light sources. While ray tracing offers higher accuracy, SSGI provides a faster approximation, trading visual fidelity for improved performance. This is a crucial optimization technique for maintaining frame rates on lower-end hardware.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:19",
      "procedural_step": "Camera movement causes clipping",
      "why": "SSGI's screen-space nature means it only considers information visible to the camera. As the camera moves, previously occluded surfaces become visible, and their contribution to global illumination is suddenly included. This can cause noticeable popping or flickering artifacts if not managed carefully. This is an inherent limitation of screen-space techniques.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },

      "timestamp": "6:35",
      "procedural_step": "Baked data needed with SSGI",
      "why": "SSGI was designed to augment, not replace, traditional baked lighting workflows. Baked lighting provides a foundation of static global illumination, while SSGI adds dynamic, view-dependent effects. Relying solely on SSGI without baked data can result in a flat, unconvincing lighting appearance.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "3:21",
      "prompt": "Imagine you're targeting both high-end PCs and mobile devices. How would you strategically combine Lumen, ray tracing, and SSGI to achieve the best balance of visual quality and performance on each platform?",
      "expected_insight": "Use Lumen and ray tracing on high-end PCs for maximum fidelity, and switch to SSGI on mobile devices to maintain acceptable frame rates, potentially with lower resolution or simplified materials."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:50",
      "prompt": "Why does SSGI exhibit clipping artifacts, and what strategies can you employ to minimize their impact on the final image?",
      "expected_insight": "Clipping occurs because SSGI only considers visible surfaces. Strategies include using overscan, adjusting camera properties, and carefully designing scenes to minimize situations where surfaces abruptly enter or exit the camera's view."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:14",
      "prompt": "Under what circumstances might you choose to use screen space reflections in conjunction with SSGI, even though they are less accurate than ray-traced reflections?",
      "expected_insight": "When performance is a critical concern, or when ray-traced reflections introduce too much noise or visual artifacts. SSGI and SSR can provide a faster, albeit less accurate, alternative."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:01",
      "prompt": "What are the potential drawbacks of 'stacking' multiple lighting and reflection techniques (e.g., Lumen GI, SSGI, ray-traced reflections) in a single scene?",
      "expected_insight": "Increased rendering cost, potential for visual inconsistencies or artifacts, and greater complexity in managing the overall lighting appearance. Careful planning and optimization are essential to avoid these issues."
