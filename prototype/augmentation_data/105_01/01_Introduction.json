    {
      "timestamp": "0:18",
      "procedural_step": "Discussing actor persistence types.",
      "why": "Understanding actor persistence is crucial because Sequencer interacts differently with actors spawned at runtime versus those placed directly in the level. Runtime-spawned actors require special handling within Sequencer tracks to ensure proper animation and control.",

      "prompt": "How does the concept of 'actor persistence' influence your approach to animating characters that are spawned dynamically during gameplay?",
      "expected_insight": "Dynamically spawned actors require explicit binding to Sequencer tracks, often through Blueprint scripting, as they don't exist in the level at editor time."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:44",
      "prompt": "Why is understanding camera components crucial for achieving a specific cinematic style in Sequencer?",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:09",
      "prompt": "How might a poorly organized level structure impact your ability to efficiently create and manage cinematic sequences?",

      "prompt": "In what scenarios would using nested level sequences be more advantageous than using a single, monolithic level sequence?",
