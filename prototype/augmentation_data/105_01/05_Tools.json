      "title": "Camera Actor Class Hierarchy",
      "concept": "The distinction between `CameraActor` and `CineCameraActor` lies in their intended use and feature set. `CameraActor` is a basic camera, while `CineCameraActor` extends it with advanced cinematic controls. Understanding the parent-child relationship is crucial for inheritance and overriding properties.",

      "title": "Sequencer Camera Binding",
      "concept": "The Camera Cuts track in Sequencer manages camera bindings. This is achieved by assigning a unique ID to each camera and referencing that ID within the track. Understanding how Sequencer resolves these bindings is essential for multi-camera setups.",

      "concept": "Scene Capture Components (2D and Cinematic) render the scene from a specific viewpoint to a render target. The Cinematic version extends the base component with CineCameraActor features, enabling post-processing and lens distortion. Understanding render targets and their usage is key.",

      "title": "Film Back and Aspect Ratio",
      "concept": "The film back setting directly influences the aspect ratio and field of view of the camera. Changing the sensor size alters the perceived perspective and depth of field. Understanding the relationship between sensor size, focal length, and field of view is crucial for achieving desired cinematic looks.",

      "title": "Depth of Field and Aperture",
      "concept": "Depth of field is controlled by the aperture (f-stop), focal length, and distance to the subject. A lower f-stop creates a shallower depth of field, blurring the background. Understanding the interplay of these factors is essential for creating cinematic focus effects.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "Diagram illustrating the relationship between aperture, focal length, and depth of field, showing how different settings affect the area of focus."

      "timestamp": "2:14",
      "procedural_step": "Use Scene Capture Component 2D to capture a live snapshot.",
      "why": "This component allows you to render the scene from a camera's perspective to a texture in real-time. This is useful for creating in-game monitors, security camera feeds, or other dynamic visual effects. The render target texture can then be used in materials or UI elements.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:41",
      "procedural_step": "Select a different film back setting.",
      "why": "Changing the film back alters the sensor dimensions, directly affecting the field of view and depth of field. This allows you to emulate different camera systems and achieve specific cinematic looks. A larger sensor generally results in a shallower depth of field.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "6:05",
      "procedural_step": "Lower the aperture number for shallower depth of field.",
      "why": "A lower aperture (e.g., f/1.4) creates a shallower depth of field because it allows more light to enter the lens, requiring less focus precision. This isolates the subject and blurs the background, drawing the viewer's attention. Conversely, a higher aperture (e.g., f/22) increases the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.",

      "prompt": "Why would using a Game Camera Actor for cinematic shots be limiting?",
      "expected_insight": "The Game Camera Actor lacks the fine-grained controls over lens settings, film back, and post-processing that are essential for achieving a specific cinematic look. Relying on post-process volumes alone can become unwieldy."
    },
    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:41",
      "prompt": "How does post-processing on the CineCameraActor differ from using global post-process volumes?",
      "expected_insight": "Applying post-processing directly to the camera allows for camera-specific effects, such as unique color grading or film grain. This provides more control and avoids unintended global effects."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:21",
      "prompt": "What are the performance implications of using Scene Capture Components, and how can they be mitigated?",

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:33",
      "prompt": "How does changing the focal length affect the perspective and composition of a shot?",
      "expected_insight": "A shorter focal length widens the field of view, exaggerating perspective and making objects appear further apart. A longer focal length compresses the perspective, making objects appear closer together and flattening the image."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "7:17",
      "prompt": "Why is it important to understand the pivot point of the actor being tracked with Look At Tracking?",
      "expected_insight": "Look At Tracking locks onto the pivot point. If the pivot point is not centered or is located in an unexpected place, the camera will not track the actor as intended, resulting in undesirable camera movement."
