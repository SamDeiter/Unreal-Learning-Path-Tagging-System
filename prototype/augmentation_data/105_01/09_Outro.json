      "title": "Sequencer Architecture",
      "concept": "Sequencer is a non-destructive, track-based editor for cinematic creation within Unreal Engine. It leverages the Actor Sequence system, allowing for complex animation and event triggering without altering the underlying assets directly. Understanding its integration with the Level Sequence asset type is crucial for efficient workflow.",

      "title": "Keyframe Interpolation Methods",
      "concept": "Sequencer uses various interpolation methods (linear, cubic, etc.) to define how values change between keyframes. The choice of interpolation method significantly impacts the smoothness and realism of animations. Understanding the mathematical basis of these methods allows for fine-tuning animation curves.",

      "timestamp": "0:47",
      "procedural_step": "Control and scroll is used for zooming the timeline.",

      "timestamp": "0:56",
      "procedural_step": "Pressing the home key on your keyboard will reset the range slider bounds.",
