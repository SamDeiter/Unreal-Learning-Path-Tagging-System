      "title": "Layer Sets and Material Slots",
      "concept": "Mixer's Layer Sets are conceptually similar to Material Slots on a Static Mesh in UE5. Material Slots allow you to assign different Materials to different parts of a single mesh. Layer Sets extend this concept within Mixer, enabling targeted painting and material application.",

      "concept": "Masking in Mixer, used to isolate effects, directly translates to UE5 Material masking. UE5 uses Texture Coordinates and various projection methods (planar, cylindrical, spherical) to control how textures are applied to surfaces. Mixer's projection options are a simplified interface for these core UE5 concepts.",
