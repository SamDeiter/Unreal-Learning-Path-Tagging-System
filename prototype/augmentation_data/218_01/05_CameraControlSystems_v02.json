      "why": "Streaming lens data allows for real-time adjustments to the virtual camera, ensuring that the CG elements composite correctly with the live footage. Without this, the post-production team would have to manually adjust these parameters, increasing the time and cost of the project. This impacts rendering fidelity and final composite quality.",

This provides granular control over the Live Link subject's behavior."
