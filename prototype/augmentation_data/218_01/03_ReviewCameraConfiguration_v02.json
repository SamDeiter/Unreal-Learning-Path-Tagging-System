      "concept": "The Media Framework in Unreal Engine 5 is responsible for handling video input. Understanding its architecture, including Media Player, Media Texture, and Media Source assets, is crucial for ICVFX. The framework allows for synchronization and playback control, enabling the compositing of CG elements with live video feeds.",

      "concept": "Composure is Unreal Engine's built-in compositing tool. It uses the Media Framework to ingest video and then applies various compositing operations. Understanding Composure's architecture, including its different compositing elements and how they interact, is essential for effective ICVFX workflows.",

      "procedural_step": "Review media profile implementation.",
      "why": "The media profile dictates how Unreal Engine accesses and interprets the video feed. Incorrect configuration leads to synchronization issues between the real-world camera and the virtual environment, breaking the illusion of seamless integration. This impacts the perceived realism and immersion of the final output.",

      "timestamp": "1:27",
      "procedural_step": "Configure media profile proxies.",
      "why": "Media profile proxies allow you to optimize performance by using lower-resolution video feeds during the calibration process. Failing to configure them correctly can lead to unnecessary performance overhead, especially when working with high-resolution video sources, impacting the responsiveness of the Unreal Engine editor and the overall workflow.",

      "expected_insight": "Optical tracking provides real-time positional data of the camera, which is crucial for aligning the virtual camera in Unreal Engine with the physical camera. Without accurate tracking, the perspective and parallax of the CG elements will not match the real-world footage, resulting in a disjointed and unrealistic composite."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:43",
      "prompt": "What are the potential consequences of calibrating only one media profile when multiple sources are available?",
      "expected_insight": "Calibrating only one media profile limits the flexibility of the ICVFX setup. If the primary video source fails or needs to be switched, the calibrated lens data will no longer be accurate for the alternative sources, requiring recalibration and disrupting the workflow. This also prevents the use of multiple cameras simultaneously for different perspectives or angles."
