      "procedural_step": "Take recorder enables you to record quickly and iteratively inside of Unreal Engine.",
      "why": "This iterative workflow is crucial because performance capture is rarely perfect on the first try. Take Recorder allows for rapid refinement and experimentation, which directly impacts the quality and efficiency of the animation process.",

    {
      "timestamp": "0:23",
      "procedural_step": "You can also use live link data for future playback.",
      "why": "Live Link provides a real-time data stream, but recording it allows for non-real-time manipulation. This decoupling is essential for post-processing, editing, and integrating the performance data into a larger cinematic sequence without being tied to the live performance setup.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:27",
      "procedural_step": "You just need to make sure you update the take recorder record type to the appropriate settings.",
      "why": "Selecting the correct record type optimizes data capture. Recording unnecessary data bloats the project and increases processing time during playback and editing. This directly impacts performance and scalability, especially in large projects.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:13",
      "procedural_step": "You don't want to record too much data that the data becomes overwhelming.",
      "why": "Excessive data capture increases the size of the level sequence, leading to longer load times, slower editing performance, and potential memory issues, especially when working with complex animations and high-resolution assets. This directly impacts the iterative workflow.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },

      "timestamp": "5:15",
      "procedural_step": "You can record directly through the cine camera via pixel streaming is also a possibility if you're using an iPad.",
      "why": "Pixel streaming allows for remote camera control and recording, enabling flexibility in camera placement and operation. This is crucial for complex shots where physical camera access is limited or impractical, impacting the overall cinematic possibilities.",

Incorrect settings can lead to excessive data capture, which can slow down the editing process and increase storage requirements."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:04",
      "prompt": "What are the trade-offs between capturing all available data and selectively recording specific properties?",
