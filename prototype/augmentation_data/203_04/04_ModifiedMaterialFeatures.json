      "concept": "Unreal Engine's material shading models (e.g., Default Lit, Subsurface, Clear Coat) define how light interacts with a surface. Path Tracer relies on these models to accurately simulate global illumination, reflections, and refractions. Understanding the physical basis of each shading model is crucial for achieving realistic rendering results.",

      "concept": "Energy conservation ensures that the total amount of light reflected and transmitted from a surface does not exceed the amount of light incident upon it. This principle is fundamental to physically based rendering (PBR) and prevents materials from appearing to emit light or violate the laws of thermodynamics. Disabling energy conservation can lead to unrealistic and unpredictable rendering results, especially in Path Tracer.",

      "concept": "The Path Tracing Quality Switch Replace node allows for creating simplified material graphs specifically for path tracing, while using more complex materials in other rendering modes. This is essential for balancing visual fidelity with performance, as path tracing can be computationally expensive. Understanding how to optimize material complexity for different rendering methods is crucial for achieving real-time or near-real-time performance.",
