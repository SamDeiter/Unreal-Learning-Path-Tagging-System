      "title": "Understanding Mesh Triangulation in Unreal Engine",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine triangulates meshes upon import to ensure consistent rendering across different hardware. This process converts all polygons into triangles, which are the fundamental rendering primitives. While this simplifies rendering, it can increase the polygon count and potentially impact performance, especially with complex meshes. Understanding the implications of triangulation is crucial for optimizing assets for Unreal Engine.",

      "title": "Deep Dive into Skeletal Mesh Retargeting",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine's Retargeting system allows animations created for one skeleton to be applied to another. This involves mapping bones between the source and target skeletons. The system handles differences in bone names, orientations, and proportions. However, significant differences in skeletal structure can lead to animation artifacts. Understanding the underlying bone mapping and transform application is essential for successful retargeting.",

      "why": "Triangulation guarantees consistent surface representation for the rasterizer, which only understands triangles. This ensures predictable rendering regardless of the source mesh's original polygon structure. However, excessive triangulation can increase vertex count, impacting performance.",

      "timestamp": "1:42",
      "procedural_step": "Check on import bone tracks",
      "why": "Importing bone tracks is essential to transfer the animation data associated with each bone in the skeleton. Without this, the animation will not be applied to the skeletal mesh, resulting in a static pose. This ensures the skeletal mesh deforms correctly according to the animation.",

    {
      "timestamp": "2:12",
      "procedural_step": "Force front X axis",
      "why": "Enforcing the X-axis as 'forward' aligns the asset with Unreal Engine's coordinate system (Z-up). This prevents unexpected rotations or orientations, ensuring the asset behaves as intended within the Unreal Engine environment. Mismatched coordinate systems can lead to unpredictable behavior during gameplay or cinematic sequences.",

      "timestamp": "2:17",
      "procedural_step": "Convert scene",
      "why": "Converting the scene to centimeters ensures consistency with Unreal Engine's default unit scale. This prevents scaling issues and ensures accurate physics simulations and distance calculations. Discrepancies in unit scale can lead to objects appearing too large or small, and can break physics-based interactions.",

    {
      "timestamp": "2:38",
      "procedural_step": "Retarget it with the new Retargeting toolset",
      "why": "Retargeting adapts animations from one skeleton to another, compensating for differences in bone proportions and orientations. Without retargeting, animations designed for a specific skeleton will not correctly deform a different skeleton, leading to visual artifacts. This ensures animations can be reused across different character models.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:22",
