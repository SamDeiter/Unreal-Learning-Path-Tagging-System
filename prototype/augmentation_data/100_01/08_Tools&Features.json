      "concept": "The Details panel reflects the underlying Unreal Engine object system. When an object is selected, the Details panel dynamically displays its properties based on its class definition. This allows for real-time modification of object parameters, influencing gameplay, rendering, and behavior.",

      "concept": "The editor's real-time rendering provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) experience. This is achieved through the engine's rendering pipeline, which simulates lighting, shadows, and materials in the editor viewport. This allows developers to iterate quickly on visual aspects of the game without constant recompilation.",
