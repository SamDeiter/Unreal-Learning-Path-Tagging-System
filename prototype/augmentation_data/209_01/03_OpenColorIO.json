Detail how OpenColorIO facilitates the necessary transformations to maintain color accuracy throughout the virtual production workflow.",
      "diagram_suggestion": "A diagram illustrating the color pipeline, showing the transformation from sRGB to linear space for rendering, and back to sRGB for display, highlighting the role of OpenColorIO."

      "procedural_step": "Apply color conversion to media sources.",
      "why": "Failing to convert media sources to the correct color space will cause mismatches in lighting and color grading, resulting in non-photorealistic composites. This is because Unreal's renderer operates in linear color space, and source footage is often in sRGB or other non-linear spaces.",

      "timestamp": "0:41",
      "procedural_step": "Blend CG elements and live frames.",
      "why": "Without proper color space management, blending CG and live footage will introduce color artifacts, such as crushed blacks or blown-out highlights. This is because the mathematical operations performed during compositing are only accurate in a linear color space.",
