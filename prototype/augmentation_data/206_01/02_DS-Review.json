      "title": "Understanding Tessellation and its Impact on Rendering",
      "concept": "Tessellation dynamically increases the polygon count of a mesh at runtime, improving visual fidelity at the cost of performance. Unreal Engine's Nanite virtualized geometry system offers an alternative approach, automatically handling level-of-detail (LOD) and tessellation without manual intervention, potentially offering better performance and visual quality. Explore Nanite as a superior alternative to manual tessellation for high-poly models.",

      "title": "Level of Detail (LOD) Management in Unreal Engine",
      "concept": "Level of Detail (LOD) is a technique used to reduce the complexity of a mesh as it gets further away from the camera, improving rendering performance. Unreal Engine provides tools to automatically generate LODs, simplifying the process. Understanding the trade-offs between visual quality and performance is crucial for optimizing your scene. Explore the HLOD system for large world partitioning.",

      "title": "Material Instances and Parent-Child Relationships",
      "concept": "Unreal Engine's material system allows you to create parent materials and then create instances of those materials. This allows you to change the properties of all instances of a material by changing the parent material. This is a powerful way to manage materials in a large project. Explore Material Parameter Collections for global material adjustments.",

      "prompt": "Why is preserving the original arrangement of objects more important in manufacturing/construction than in game development?",
      "expected_insight": "In manufacturing, the arrangement often represents a specific design or assembly process that must be accurately replicated in the engine for visualization, simulation, or training purposes. Game development often involves more artistic freedom and iterative placement."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "2:47",
      "prompt": "What are the potential drawbacks of applying a global tessellation setting during import?",
      "expected_insight": "A global setting might over-tessellate some assets, leading to unnecessary performance overhead, while under-tessellating others, resulting in poor visual quality. A more nuanced approach is often required."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "4:00",
      "prompt": "Why does re-tessellating a Static Mesh affect all instances of that mesh in the level?",
      "expected_insight": "Static Mesh instances share the same underlying geometry data. Modifying the source Static Mesh directly changes the geometry for all instances referencing it. This highlights the importance of understanding instancing for memory management and performance."

    {
      "insert_after_timestamp": "5:35",
      "prompt": "How could Material Instances help optimize the process of replacing materials on multiple chassis parts?",
      "expected_insight": "By creating a Material Instance from a master material, you can change the appearance of all chassis parts simultaneously by modifying the parameters of the Material Instance, rather than replacing each material individually. This reduces redundancy and simplifies material management."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "6:53",
      "prompt": "What are the scalability implications of manually processing each mesh and material in a large project?",
      "expected_insight": "Manual processing becomes exponentially more time-consuming and error-prone as the project size increases. This can lead to project delays, inconsistencies, and increased development costs. Automation is crucial for managing large datasets efficiently."
