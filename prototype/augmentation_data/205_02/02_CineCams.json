      "concept": "Post-process materials applied directly to the CineCameraActor are evaluated per-view. Understanding the material graph execution order and render target dependencies is crucial for performance, especially when using custom depth or stencil buffers.",

      "procedural_step": "CineCameraActor emulates a real-world camera.",
      "why": "This emulation allows for physically accurate depth of field and motion blur, which are crucial for achieving realistic cinematic visuals. The engine calculates these effects based on the camera's film back, lens settings, and focus distance.",

    {
      "timestamp": "0:43",
      "procedural_step": "GameCameraActor is simpler.",
      "why": "The GameCameraActor prioritizes performance over cinematic control. Its simplified feature set reduces rendering overhead, making it suitable for real-time gameplay where frame rate is critical. However, this comes at the cost of less realistic depth of field and motion blur.",

    {
      "timestamp": "2:13",
      "procedural_step": "Adjust diaphragm blade count.",
      "why": "The diaphragm blade count affects the shape of the bokeh. Lower counts create polygonal bokeh, while higher counts create smoother, more rounded bokeh. This is a direct result of how the engine simulates the aperture shape during depth-of-field calculations.",

      "why": "The Camera Cuts track tells the engine which camera's viewpoint to render. Without it, the engine doesn't know which camera to use, resulting in a black screen or the default perspective view during rendering. This is because the engine only renders from the active camera specified in the Camera Cuts track.",

      "expected_insight": "The CineCameraActor offers greater control over cinematic effects like depth of field and motion blur, which can enhance visual quality. However, this comes at a performance cost. The decision depends on the visual fidelity requirements and performance budget of the project."
