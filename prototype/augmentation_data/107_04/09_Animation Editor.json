      "concept": "Animation Notifies are markers within an animation sequence that trigger events. They communicate with the Gameplay Framework via the AnimGraph, allowing for synchronization between animation and game logic. Understanding the AnimGraph's role as a state machine is crucial for effective notify usage.",

Understanding the underlying data structures of Sequencer (FMovieScene, FMovieSceneTrack, FMovieSceneSection) is key to advanced usage and customization.",
