      "procedural_step": "Covering lighting terminology and types",
      "why": "Understanding lighting terminology is crucial because it directly impacts how you manipulate light properties within the Unreal Engine editor. Incorrect terminology can lead to misinterpreting the effect of parameters like 'Source Radius' or 'Attenuation Radius', resulting in unintended visual outcomes and wasted iteration time.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:33",
      "procedural_step": "Control exposure",
      "why": "Controlling exposure is essential because it simulates the human eye's adaptation to different lighting conditions. Incorrect exposure settings can lead to scenes that are either washed out or too dark, obscuring details and negatively impacting the perceived realism of the environment. This is controlled via the Camera settings and PostProcessVolume.",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:39",
      "procedural_step": "Taking a look at Lumen",
      "why": "Lumen's dynamic global illumination system is the default in Unreal Engine 5 because it provides realistic lighting without the need for extensive pre-computation (light baking). However, understanding its limitations (e.g., light leaking, performance cost) is crucial for optimizing scenes and avoiding visual artifacts. Disabling Lumen can drastically improve performance on lower-end hardware, but at the cost of visual fidelity.",
      "antipattern_warning": null
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:58",
      "procedural_step": "Lumen's reflection system",
      "why": "Lumen's reflection system contributes significantly to the realism of scenes by simulating how light bounces off surfaces. Understanding the difference between Screen Space Reflections (SSR) and Ray Traced Reflections is crucial because SSR is cheaper but less accurate, while Ray Traced Reflections are more accurate but more expensive. Choosing the right reflection method is a trade-off between visual quality and performance.",

      "insert_after_timestamp": "0:43",
      "prompt": "How does Lumen's dynamic global illumination differ from traditional light baking techniques, and what are the trade-offs?",
      "expected_insight": "Lumen eliminates the need for pre-computed lighting, allowing for dynamic lighting changes and faster iteration. However, it comes with a performance cost and potential artifacts that need to be managed."

      "insert_after_timestamp": "1:02",
      "prompt": "In what scenarios would you prioritize screen space reflections over ray-traced reflections, and why?",
      "expected_insight": "Screen space reflections are suitable for less critical reflections and when performance is a primary concern. Ray-traced reflections are preferred for high-quality reflections in visually prominent areas."
