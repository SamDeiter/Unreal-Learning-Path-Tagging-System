      "concept": "Landscape sculpting tools utilize falloff functions (e.g., linear, smooth step, Gaussian) to determine how the brush's influence attenuates with distance from its center. Understanding these functions allows for precise control over sculpting effects, preventing harsh transitions and creating more natural-looking terrain.",

      "expected_insight": "Different falloff types (linear, smooth step, Gaussian) affect the smoothness of the terrain transitions. Steeper falloffs can create sharp edges, while smoother falloffs can blend terrain features more naturally. Smoother falloffs might require more calculations, impacting performance."

Higher tessellation values increase the vertex count and rendering complexity, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks, especially on lower-end hardware. Balancing visual fidelity with performance is crucial."
