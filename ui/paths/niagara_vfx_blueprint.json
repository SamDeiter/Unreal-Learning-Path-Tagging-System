This involves learning how to expose data from Niagara systems and access that data within a Blueprint.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Action:** Look for examples of how to expose particle parameters (e.g., color, size, location) from a Niagara system and then retrieve those values in a Blueprint using the 'Get Niagara Particle Value' node. Pay attention to how data types are handled between Niagara and Blueprint.",
